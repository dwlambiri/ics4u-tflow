Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Let me see what I can do.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
Well, there's someone I think might be --
Where?
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
I believe we share an art instructor
Tons
You always been this selfish?
What crap?
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
The "real you".
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
I hope so.
No.
Joey.
I don't have to be home 'til two.
Expensive?
Hi, Joey.
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Can we go now?
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
In 9th.  For a month
Why?
But you hate Joey
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
So did you
I just wanted --
Perm?
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
Exactly my point
And where're you going?
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Daddy, no!
Just for a minute
Because she'll scare them away.
No, but
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
Who is she?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
You wanna go out with him?
He seems like he thrives on danger
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
That's what I just said
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
Dead at forty-one.
Okay!  I wasn't sure
It's her favorite band.
No, I ' m not.
Don't make me do it, man
It's off. The whole thing.
She's partial to Joey, not me
Then, go get her
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
She kissed me.
Where?
You get the girl.
Away.
Your sister here?
And why would I do that?
What do you think?
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
What?
A hundred bucks a date.
Forget it.
Forget her sister, then.
A deal's a deal.
Do what?
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Are you lost?
Nope - just came by to chat
We don't chat.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
You and Verona?
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
Block E?
An attempted slit.
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
William didn't even go to high school
That's never been proven
Neither has his heterosexuality.
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Who?
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
My mission in life.
Oh, right.  Friday.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
Seven-thirty?

That's what you want, isn't it?
Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
Why, don't you?
Funny, you're the only one
I'm fine. I'm
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I know, just let me sleep
I told you
You don't care if I die
Why?
Dorsey.
I hate him.
You know what they say
What?
Were you in jail?
Maybe.
No, you weren't
Then why'd you ask?
Why'd you lie?
Do what?
This.
My father wouldn't approve of that that
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
BIANCA
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so --
Pleasant?
Unwelcome.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
Try lookin' at it from this angle
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
I dazzled him with my wit
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
So what's your excuse?
Acting the way we do.
Yes
Then you screwed up
How?
You never disappointed me.
For. . . ?
Fallacy.
The duck?
Hearsay.
I hate peas.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
No one else knows
Go to the prom with me
You know what I mean
Why not?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's just something I had.  You know
What?
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.
Why can't we agree on this?
Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right
So what I want doesn't matter?
Which parts?
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Hi.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Yeah.  I guess.
Oh yeah.
Kat a fan, too?
Yeah...
What?
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Good enough.
Yeah.
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
With the teeth of your zipper?
See you next week!
Make anyone cry today?
You're not helping.
But -- who -- what --?
Did I have anything to say about it?
That ' s what I thought
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
If they agree to follow me, yes.
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
I know.
I find that hard to believe.
Thank God...
I don't want you to wait for me.
That's something you can't decide.
You don't usually ask.
I am busy inside.
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
Yes... I remember...
Appointment to what?
Viceroy of the West Indies.
There'll be a time.
You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
This time with me!
Not bad.
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
No?
Then you are too ambitious.
... for a commoner?
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
What...?  Do I have so many already?
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
All of them created by people like me.
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Chief knows.
Thousands.
Chief says -- he has a God.
... and also to bring medicine.
Chief says...
Ask him if he will help.
You did the same to your God!
That's what it says.
How did you manage it?
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
Esdras is a Jew.
So was Christ!
Father Marchena!
Passion is something one cannot control!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
Colon!  Don't!
Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
Give me absolution.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
I knew you would.
New worlds create new people.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
That she was impregnable.
Surely you can do anything you want.
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
Six days ago, yes.
You must be mad...!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You think I don't know that?
We're lost!
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You're right.  Let the men decide.
He must be replaced.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Here.  I have your money.
Where are we going?
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
Oh, sure.
I was all of these.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
No.  No way.
But it's...
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
Yes, but he was a cop.
They won't until this is over.
Divorced.
Yeah.  This way.
Yes, I considered it.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
No.
What are you asking me?
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
I'm sorry.
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
I'm glad I met you.
Right.
I'll get my clothes.
Pouring it out!
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
I let her take a shower.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
No!  Nothing happened.
Okay.  But not water sports.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
What was that, Korfin?
When?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
You ready?
A timer.
Takin' a bath.
Any I.D.?
It's okay.
Yeah.
No.  I'm okay.
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
Nah, I musta missed it.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
I don't even watch TV.
Good.  Good.  Commendable.
Hmmmm.
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
My folks are.
Stay here.
You got any better ideas?
Mind if I ride along with you?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
But what if it does?  You might need my help.
Better than one.
I'm on duty.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Something back home?
I don't have a girlfriend.
My point exactly.
I'm serious here.
So am I.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
What do you want?
I kill someone famous.
Then do it, asshole.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Is it drug related?
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Alright?
Alright.
Alright.
Okay.
Hey.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
I'm not.
You're not so bad yourself.
Yeah.
I love you.
You promise?
Yeah.  I promise.
See you later.  Good luck.
Thank you.
Don't be late.
Not what.  Who.
Okay.  You ready?
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
And what do you do with the bones?
No.  Are you proposing?
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
I have five-hundred dollars.
Is there a problem?
How long are you planning to stay?
He doesn't speak English.
New York's finest.  This is his case.
In here, says he wants a million.
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
I want to document my trip to America.
We have no money.  Come on.
You said speak Czech!
How you erase this?
I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
Does it hurt?
Don't want to film this?
Put the camera down, Oleg.
Shut up.  Look!
No, I don't get that!
Surprise!  Surprise!
Ha. Ha.
A job?
Yes, the money is good.
It's easy to learn.
What are you doing here?
You've got a call.
You want the tape?  There it is!
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
I'm trying to tell you.
Alright.  Go ahead.
What are you coming here to do?
I'm here for movies.
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
No way!  He's mine!
He's my collar!
Well, he killed my partner!
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Oh yeah?  Guess again.
I used an accelerant.
Yeah?  What kind?
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Oh yeah, why?
Clean?
Don't blow your nose!
What??
You hear that question, Garcia?
Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.
Not good.
What the hell happened?
They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted.
She's wonderful.
Right. Just a sec.
Okay. 
Okay, come on down.
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
It's about my salary cheques.
Yes?
Yes.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Yes, I thought so.
But not completely inconceivable?
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I guess it isn't.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
No.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Yes.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
Well, don't worry about it.
And don't you worry about it.
Yes, it is, Hal.
Yes, it is.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
Well, what is it?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Are you coming to my party?
In three days, darling, I hope.
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
She's in the bathroom.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Thank you.
Well, how's it going back there?
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
How is gregor?
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, very pleasant.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Yes, really, thank you very much.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
I see.
Well, I'm glad about that.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
Any clue as to what it is?
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
Thank you very much, Hal.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
Hammond.
Yeah, I've been busy.
How about chargin' the battery?
Vodka.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
You got a real big mouth, convict.
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
Here's hoping, baby...
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
Would you guys...
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
No chance.
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
Sure, anything you want.
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
I got a lot to protect.
I'll think about it.
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
I may call you worse than that.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Want to try it again?
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
You have a good time?
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
Must be billy's girl.
Half a million.
Jesus.
Not likely, convict.
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
You stay with me...
Hello. And goodbye.
What about Ganz?
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
Luther's on the move...
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
Yeah?
I lost them, that's what happened.
How did they get away?
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Yeah.
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
One of  em's in the slam.
Doesn't look like it.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
You're hopeless.
What's wrong with that?
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
That's the way I see it, too.
Call me later.
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
Guess people ought to know who I am...
Yeah, one of my favorites.
You made the front page.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
So am I.
Jack?  What was that?
Just a second, that's all!
Hi, it's me...
Fuck you.
Hiya, kid.
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
Where is he?
That's what I always say.
How would you know?
Hey, two days with him is enough.
That's no bull.
Shut up.
What do you want?
Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
Can't complain.
Yeah, old times.
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
You chickenshit punk...
First, the money.
Not bad, not bad.
Naw, right here's okay.
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
Five bills.
Five.  On credit.
This ain't a credit business.
Try and take it.
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Corn-i-Lius?
At your service.
Napoleon... small.
The case was stolen?
You know exactly where they are!
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
No thank you.
I know...
I brought the girl remember?
The girl?
You noticed...
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
That's what I thought.
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
We have to save the world.
Good luck..
Of course.
When is she not in trouble?
Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
Yes..thank God..
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
What is?
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Perfect.
It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
I don't have time... I need to know.
They are... with me...
Hey bud! Finger here.
How do I look?
Like shit.
In your dreams! See you tonight!
5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..
...'Scuse me?
Vito Cornelius?
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
We will be ready, Lord.
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
Have you pulled yourself together?
...Not yet.
You little sleaze bag!
...Ma???
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
You have nine points left on your license..
Thanks for reminding me..
This is a police control action..
Found it?
Fuck it! Hold tight!
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
To save the world.
Where have I heard this song before?
You're the only one left alive...
I've had enough good news for today
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
I'm not going.
Why not?
I thought you were divorced.
Oh, yes you will...
I suppose that means "Hi" ?
Uh..you're welcome.
Cornelius..
Oh god!
Learning language.
Which one?
All 900.
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
...Hoppi-hoppa.
You get that off the screen?
OK, you can turn around!
No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
I told you not to read all that crap!
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
I'm so tired...
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
I want to sleep... forever...
Exactly.
Been here long?
You're welcome..
Actually only one cell survived..
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
An elephant couldn't crack it.
And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
...What do you mean?
How much time is left?
Perfect, Mr. President.
Wait or act.
Recommendations.
I'm about to, Mr. President.
Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
To fame.. salud..
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
No... not at all.  Where are you?
How's our deal coming along?
...I can't wait to be among you.
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Your clothing reeks of it.
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Okay, I believe you.
I love you.
Tom?  Where have you been... ?
Just do it, Amy, please, go.
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
You couldn't?
You don't understand...
You're killing me...
Don't...
Mrs. Christian.
There's nothing harder.
Snuff?
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
I'm telling you...
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
Nobody knows anything.
A fellow investor.
Hmm.
Is it?
I want to watch you work.
I'll consider it.
What's the problem?
I'm camera shy.
Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
Right here.
They should be here any minute.
Take out your gun!
Look, I don't know what this...
I remember him.
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
Leave him alone.
Fuck off.
Alright, Tom.
We do.
Why don't they come to me?
Eddie.
Yeah, who's this?
I know what you did.
What?
I know what you did.
Who is this.
What the fuck are you.. ?
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
How'd you find me here?
What do you want?
Who is Machine?
I want his name.
I told you, I don't know.
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
What the fuck do you want from me?
Because we're going there.
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
Where?  Show me where.
Don't think I won't.
I never killed anyone.
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
You are a private investigator?
That's right.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
I'm asking.
Enlighten me.
Fuck you.
Yeah... guess so.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
Three, four years.
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
Not quite.
Four hundred a week, off the books.
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
See you then.  Oh, and, don't call me "pops."
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
Where are your parents?
I don't know, where are yours?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
You're learning.
Where does he sell it?
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
Great.
It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
I try to be.
He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
Cash, stock certificates, and this...
I'm afraid I don't...
Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
I told you I can't, not yet.
You don't have any other choice.
You've found missing persons before.
Nothing remotely like this.
I'm not positive this means anything.
The checks were for odd amounts...
I'm here.
You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
How are you?  Having any luck?
She just seemed... depressed... ?
I don't know.
It got to be too much for him.
Are you religious?
No.
You should be.
Do you think the police did a good job?
I don't know.  I think so.
Will you let me look?
Those are her belongings.
Her belongings?
No, sir, he is not.
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Okay.  Fine.
I don't want to.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
I can't find him.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
What?
That obvious, huh?
Then you saw him, too?
You're his sister, right?
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
Extra money, huh?
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
Three days.
Is there something we can do?
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
It's okay, we're just about there.
You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
Save it for later.  Come on!
Alright, I think I see salvation...
Enough of that crap.
Earth to Alice...
Let me talk to you.
Your distraught.  It'll help...
Avoid-all-contact-day.
Oh God!  He killed them!
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
You had a nasty bump.
You just stay put.  You need rest.
You don't get it, he's after me...
Don't worry, honey
It's okay, Dan
What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
Huh?
It's lonely in there, in my room.
My name is...
How did you know that?
My friend, with the funny hand.
He's inside you, where he hides.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
Sorry, babe.
He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
There you go.  Love you.
Me too.
To take a picture.
It's just across the park.
Sobering...
Very funny.
Alice...
Since my little girl became a mom...
You disappointed in me?
I've got to go.
Now.
Had kind of a long night.
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
So did Dan.
Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
Mark!
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
My baby!
What, you named it already?
That's their problem.
No shit.
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
My undying love.  Have some.
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
Makes you look like a nun--
I want to talk about the baby.
Faint.
Stick around, please?
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
My father!  He's not - ?
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
I don't know.
'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
Listen!  Hear that?
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
The sound again?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
We'll have to look for them later.
I'm with <u>you!</u>
Seems to be all around...
What about down?
Right at our one-eyed friend!
We hope!
Yes, Griff?
Radiation level...constantly rising...
What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
What direction does the system indicate?
After torpedo room:  Report!
Take a look.
Thirty-four seconds!
That's what I said!
But - what can we accomplish?
We can <u>ram</u> him!
Nothing we can do, now.
I am afraid not.  Therefore -
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
I'll be another!
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
Toward the Pole!
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
No.
Same old shit.
Chub says you're fired.
How soon?
This spring.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Yeah.
No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
We bought you.
That was me.
Yeah.
You might not kill it.
You think so.
Yeah?
Drafted by the Red Sox.
Double A. New Britain.
Oh.
They said.
Hmm.
Yeah.
Sun's gettin high.
Deers have ears too.
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
In the chest.
No, I mean whereabouts.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
You stayed away?
Where'd you get the blood?
What blood?
On your sleeve.
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
What?
Saw him do it?
He sure as hell won't.
Lawford?
I don't care. They're out.
Do what?
You know.
Break stuff?
Yeah. It's stupid.
I guess they're stupid.
To us it was.
But it's not funny now.
What are you talking about?
What then?
It's stupid.
It's fun.
No what?
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Jesus, why?
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Pop?
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Oh.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
What do you want, then?
Nothing.
Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
Fine.
You can't.
I know.
You're a policeman.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
I want to go home.
Okay, let's go home, then.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
I figured you already heard.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
Yeah. A few things.
I'm fine, fine.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
On what you pay me?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
I won't. You interested?
Maybe.
Could be.
Where's Jill?
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
It's just...
See. Get your boots.
Hi honey.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
I know who it is.
Good. Who?
Mel Gordon.
I still don't understand --
For a while.
Okay. She's fine.
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Said what?
I'm sorry.
Yeah. I mean that.
Tonight. Let's get together.
Okay.
Jack doesn't need money.
You knew me as a kid.
You've been married twice --
Good.
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
How?
Wade.
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
You're not using it today?
When did she die?
Is...? She's dead then?
Can --?
How's that?
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
What?
The other guy.
Where... how'd you hear that?
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
He got his deer yet?
Atta-go.
You no-good pup!
You remember Margie Fogg?
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
Love! I'm made of love!
Call it what you want.
Everything you know is from me.
Bang!
You and me.
Wade?
Twombley.
You think Jack shot him?
Well, it was an accident.
Huh?
The night before the shooting.
How was she?
Yeah, I guess.
Get some sleep.
Yeah. I forgot.
What about her?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Want to know what I think happened?
Then who shot him?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
Yeah, no duh.
Don't you even want to ask?
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
Back at The Fishbowl?
That's not really the point.
Yes dear?
Jim... for godsake!
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
You are a resilient man, Mr.
Hey, you guys back already?
It was the experience of a lifetime.
How `bout a hug for the old man.
Daddy...
Alice... I...
Been better, Dad... You?
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
Got it.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
Put your pilot on.
He's busy being dead.
I'm doing what I can.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Stay cool.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
This doesn't make sense.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.
To swear you in as President.
Yes, Mr. President.
Why?
My loyalty was never to my country.
How many others killed?
Nine.
Any of us?
A secret service agent. It must be.
why did they do that?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Well it worked.
Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
Tower, here.
I guess it depends on your perspective.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Come on, Alice.
I know he left you behind.
My husband is a very courageous man.
Why? Do you enjoy it?
Say something dear.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Jim...
Three...
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
You'll do it?
One thing I've learned as
Yes, sir.
That isn't necessary.
No, Mr. President.  It can't.
Rose, I don't have time for this.
What?
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
I wish it were that easy...
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
Please... don't start with me.
Both of you.
Flying the plane.
Excuse me?
The fax machines.
No. I thought about this, Mr.
White House Situation room.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
We're under attack.
Where's my family?
We're handling it, sir.
But...
Two... THREE. GO!
This is the President.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
Thank you for calling the white House...
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
He and the NRA don't like the wording.
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
That's my job.
Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Sir...
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
We're hooked. Hove into position.
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
That just doesn't make any sense.
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
What's the story?
Commissioner, Aquarius.
Yes I did...
Felt like a large asteroid.
Dunn.
You better take this.
Te...!
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Ask Simon.
If that's the way you want it.
Let me by, Elaine.
Not now, Elaine!
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
What word would you use, Elaine?
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
Ted!
Elaine, what's going on?
Ted, there's no time to explain.
Not now, Elaine.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
That might be the news we've been waiting for.
That's right -- premature ejection.
What will happen to him, Ted?
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Now!
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
I'm so excited, Simon.
I guess this is a first for you.
So mentally ill?
I think so.
That's my girl.
Simon, what are you saying?!
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
That's not possible.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Request; life support systems check.
We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
Can I hold him?
Sure.
He's a boy dog.
Yeah.
I don't want to hear that word!
What...?
I'm sure.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
Poached!  Not over!  Over!
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
Sixteen 'C', why?
He's carrying a bomb.
A b...
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
All right, it's a matter of death.
Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
Don't try to stop me!
But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.
No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Thank you. Cream?
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
Surely you can't be serious.
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Surely there must be something you can do.
I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
I can't tell.
Well...not for another two hours.
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
He had fish.
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
Ted!
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
I love you.
Headquarters!? What is it?
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
And a little ice.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Yes?
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
Uh-huh.
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
Every day.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Good-bye, darling.
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
What is it?
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
I'm Randy.
Okay, this is one of my favorites.
I will, but Jim won't.
Huh?
Huh?
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
No, why don't you take care ot it?
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
Yes?
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
That's right.
Yes...
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
He didn't recognize me.
Here?
Do it!
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
Nothing.
And that fits?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
And still it fits?
Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
Why'd I do what?
At the end of the bar.
Back off, George.
But I-- .
I'll handle it.
Screw me?  That can't be right.
Your mother mates out of season.
Stay back!  I'm okay.
This is mole.  It's good.
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.
Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
You are married?
Ta ss'trakyona'...
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it.
To the... to the beach?
Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
Why?
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Nothing.
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
We all did.
I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
Do what?!  George-- ?!
... It's Harcourt.
Harcourt is dead.
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
You understand that.  But how many others will?
You look very good.
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
For you, anything.
What's that?
Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
You?
It is. 
Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.
I can't!  Do you mind!
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Position?
Can't lock up...
Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
How long until it blows?
What?
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
Well, thanks, I --
Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
Hear me out...
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
Dead on all channels.
The structure seems intact.  They have power.
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
Proceed inside.
Shut up.  Just shut up!
They're but off!  Do something!
Yes, Hicks?
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
He's coming in.  I feel safer already.
Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
You tell me.  I only work here.
Sure, Hicks.
Not that tunnel, the other one!
Do it!
Let's get these things lit.
Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
Fuckin' A!
On my way.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Stand back.
We ain't going anywhere.
Don't be long, Ellen.
Anytime.  Anywhere.
You're just reading me.
Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
Uh, what's next?
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
It's readin' right.  Look!
Terrible.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
Just a couple of days.  Do you feel up to a visitor?
What about me?
Cross my heart.
And hope to die?
I'm sorry, Newt.
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Did one of those things grow inside her?
Where is she?
Gone.
You mean dead.
Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.
I know, honey.  Me too.
Look!
Right here, baby.  Right here.
That's right.
Can we dream?
Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
Sweet Jesus.
What do you mean?
Good morning.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
How do you know?
In a harem.
What's that?
Oh!
A Turkish brothel.
You might be disappointed.
Why?
Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
You were sublime.
What did you think of the music?
Meaning you didn't like it.
What?
Don't bother.
I'll be right back.
I'm so relieved.
What??
I want to go!
Where?
Yes!
Why?
What are you talking about?
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Why? People fart backwards.
Do you think that's funny?
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
No, I'm not playing this game.
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
Tish-I'm-tee.
Eat
Yes.
Eat my - ah!
Oh, leave me alone.
Well, don't do that again!
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
Tell them to go!
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
Yes!
I don't know.
Well, ask her!
Yes, my love?
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
What?
Why not? Half the house!
No one.
I heard voices.
Why not?
You'd think I was mad.
Why?
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
I can't write it!
Why not?
It's killing me.
No, sir. This is my own idea.
Yes.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
Tonight?
Alone.
What for?
What do you mean?
Isn't it obvious?
I was at hand.
And I'm asking you -
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
Not at all.
Where's our friend?
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
Oh, yes.
When, may I ask?
In three months! Papa.
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
Be careful!
Adorable!
Behold!
Hey!
Behold!
Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
Michael!
Yes. He is a little strange.
Ah, now! Here she comes.
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
Who was your teacher?
Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
It's just a trifle, of course.
May I try it?
Ah-ha!
Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
Yes?
And the result satisfies.
Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
I think so, Sire, yes.
And German?
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
Would you tell me why?
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Well. There it is.
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Yes, what about him?
He's here.
Am I not welcome?
It couldn't be better.
That's not what I hear.
How many pupils do you have?
Yes.
How many?
This one will.
Why not?
It's a secret.
You don't have secrets from me.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
This is just a game, Papa.
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
Mine?
She does. She says I sleep all day.
Yes, thank you, sir.
Bene! Bene!
Do any pupils come to the house?
Not that I've seen.
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
In there, sir.
I don't know. He has pains.
Are you Herr Mozart?
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
Sssh! Stay here.
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
I liked the horse.
Wolfi!
Put it down!
Can I see it?
No.
Why not?
Because there's nothing to see.
Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
My answer is no, Mozart.
Ah!
Did you like it, then?
How could I not?
So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
Herr Sommer.
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
Do you have a daughter?
I'm afraid not.
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
I can't say. Really
Thank you! Oh, thank you.
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!
How could I not?
Did my work please you?
How could it not, Excellency?
Yes?
A Mass for the dead.
What dead? Who is dead?
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
The doctor thinks I am. But -
No! No, it's him!
Who?
The man. He's here.
What man?
He knows. He knows!
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
What?
Strange!
Come. Let's begin.
We ended in F Major?
Yes.
So now - A minor. Suddenly.
What time?
Common time.
Sing it back.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
With the tenors.
Also identical?
I think so.
Show me.
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Yes!
You go fast!
Yes.
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I am so ashamed.
What for?
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
Taking out what you should never have put in.
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
What is what?
Is the Emperor angry with me?
On the contrary.
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
No, but I'm the best.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Who is on this committee?
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
Here in Vienna.
Then you must know this.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
All Vienna has heard that.
And do they believe it?
Is it true?
Do you believe it?
Should I?
He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
No? Was Mozart a good man?
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
No, you didn't!
I poisoned his life.
But not his body.
What difference does that make?
Exactly.
You must be mad.
I've seen the manuscript.
Where?
Never mind.
Incredible.
About the ballet.
Ballet? What ballet?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Yes, in the third act.
Well done, Sire!
What? Who the devil are you?
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
Well, promise then.
What do you mean - now?
Excuse me, my dear.
Show her in. Then go to bed.
Can we come in?
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
But he's all right?
I'll call tomorrow.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
Go about your duties.
Yes, Doctor.
Yes, Doctor?
What exactly did he call out?
He said 'Jack'.
Yes, I believe he did.
Come to my office, Miss Price.
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
What did he say?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
The zoo? Is he rational?
Is David acting strangely?
No, not really.
Yes, I should think so.
No, a cab will be faster.
I expect you shortly.
Tea would be nice.
I beg your pardon?
It was a wolf.
What?
A wolf.
Yes?
You haven't eaten your lunch.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
Call me Alex.
Aw come on, Alex!
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
Will you give me a break?
I thought you were asleep.
I was. What are you reading?
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
I dream of death mostly.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
That's not really a very proper question.
How old are you?
Twenty-eight.
I'm twenty-seven.
I know.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
Shall I read to you?
What? Oh, yes, please.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
A werewolf?
I'll let you know the next full moon.
You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
Your dead friend Jack?
I would think so.
Yeah, I would think so, too.
Very nice.
Charming.
Bathroom.
Lovely.
The bedroom.
There is only one bed.
It's nice to see you.
Yes?
Good.
I wasn't hallucinating.
Anything.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
Yeah, I do, but go to work.
A doper werewolf.
See you later.
I should be committed.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
Pull over.
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
I swear, I don't know this girl.
David, let's go now.
Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me!
No.
No what?
No.
No.
Right.
No.
No what?
No!
I thought not.
I think he's a Jew.
Why on earth do you say that?
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
You did, did you?
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
That's what I want you to do, you moron!
Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
Oh, come on, tell us.
No. You've had your chance.
I was having a nightmare.
What are you going to see?
Some, everyone does.
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
You're in a hospital in London.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
Yes.
Good.
David.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
You're talking about the woman I love.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Okay.
Shall we?
Nice to see you.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Look at that.
It's a five-pointed star.
Maybe the owners are from Texas.
You ask them.
Wrong.
You ask them.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Apparently so.
Come on, I'm freezing.
I have no idea.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
I heard that.
What was it?
There aren't any coyotes in England.
Pecos Bill.
Heathcliffe.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
No, but he was on the moors.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
I don't know. Come on.
Come on, where?
It's circling us.
Plan?
Let's just keep walking.
Do you think it's a dog?
Walk away, Jack.
No.
Yeah.
Where are we going?
I'll tell you when we get there.
Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!!
Are you going to help me up?
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Thanks a lot.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
I can't stand it.
David!
What?!
I'm not listening!
What?!
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
I wanted to see you.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Get out of here, Jack!
What do you think?
Hi, David.
You don't have to say anything.
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
If I was still alive, I probably would.
Thank you.
How shall I do it?
What here?
He's on the telephone.
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Sorry, love.
I suppose Guinness will suffice.
Oh.
I beg your pardon?
I'd like some tea, please.
I don't rightly know, sir.
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
Yeah - sure!
Matt?
Yeah.
About twenty-four thousand.
It was more than that last week.
Here's twenty-five thousand.
Let me have ten bucks?
Yeah?
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
And tell him not to delay.
Yes, sir.
What about?
I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?
The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
That's very simple. I was home.
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
Why, of course.
All right, Jack, all right.
Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
That don't do us any good.
We can take blood from anything   If it's comin' to us.
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
You don't have to do nothing.
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!
Why, I needed a
Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Well, what?
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
Don't you know?
No.
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
My apartment.
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
A misunderstood bachelor.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
What are you doing here?
Yes, sir.
Yes, now.
I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
John, how's your wife this morning?
Much better this morning, thank you.
Got a handkerchief?
I'm feeling fine this morning.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
Hello, darling.
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
No.
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Now don't you worry about it.
Good morning.
Mr. Sampson . . .
All right. Send him in.
Yes?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Got my letter?
Yes, thank you.
Hello, Helen.
I haven't any.
You haven't got a uniform?
Yes, sir.
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
There you are.
You're protecting somebody.
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and
Why pick on him ?
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
What are you talking about?
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
Did you get the case for the securities?
Mine too?
Absolutely.
He's at a board meeting.
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
Matt, come here!
Why?
Come here, honey!
Oh, is that so?
With what?
The ten dollars.
Oh, ten dollars
Yes.
Oh, you think I'm lying?
Yes.
I tell you, I saw them!
Oh, Charlie again.
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that
All right, dear.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Yes, why?
He was in the bank yesterday.
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
Are you sure?
Yes, sir.
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
Huh?
It couldn't have been earlier?
No. It wasn't earlier because...
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
You used to carry a gun, didn't you?
I don't know.
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
I'm okay, Matt.
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
Where's Charlie?
Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Now you tell us.
Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
Never a good thing.
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.
Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
You stay out of this, Bob.
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
What have you done?
I ain't done --
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Swear.
I swear --
Swear on Jimmy's grave.
It's tougher than it looks.
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Then I love it.
Tomorrow.
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
He's been full of vinegar lately.
He's planning a job.
What?
I think I recognize you.
How?
What's going on?
I could use the walk.
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
You're not scared, are you?
Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that.
What is wrong with you?
She got two of them.
She was European!
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
Let's ride.
Don't let it happen again.
I got three.
What will be?
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
That's it.
And I'm the better outlaw.
A trap.
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Pass me some whisky.
I'm out.
Missed you too, cousin.
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
I'm thinking...
Both would be nice.
The brown one.
Ah.
They gonna rush us?
They're just insurance in case we run.
Of course!  Uh, sir?
What?
Where is Jesse James?
This here is the Younger Gang!
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
The District Marshall
Then why can't I go in there?
On account of we're robbing it.
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
It's a secret.
I'd appreciate that.
What is it?
My little Web did that?
Died a hero.
Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
Such as?
I figure.
I reckoned.
Hell of a war.
We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
You're doing just fine.
Maybe, maybe...
You can shut up now.
You are a charmer.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
Next time try "fat and haggard."
What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
Heard of him.
Ma.
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
Fine. How'd it go out here?
We're gonna have to talk...
The posters?
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
Jesse, we're outlaws.
And we're good at it.
If I could go back to farming --
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
Yeah, Jimmy?
They're making him a hero now.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
So what was he?
Yeah Jimmy?
Everything but the boring parts.
A fair number, Ma.
Say your prayers?
Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
Shush.
You were little Jesse James when you left.
But you got big!
Mmmm.
Nuh-huh ...
No! I mean, of course not. No.
Teasing you is completely unfair.
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Not if I find the right girl.
And what's this right girl like?
Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
Little ones.
I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.
Let the law --
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
"Hmm" what?
Stop it. This is just sad.
Swimming. Swimming is good.
What?
Yes ma'am.
I'll explain on the way.
But I like the presidential suite.
Mmm.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.
Was it worth it?
I'm not hanged yet.
You cocky little bastard.
Ahh, you'll miss me.
He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
Right here in church?
Communion.
No.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
You been with a girl ever?
This time we'll make an exception.
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
Not at all.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
I'm doing you folks a favor --
By burning down their homes?
Move you fools!
I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress.
What is going on here, man?
I look forward to seeing it.
Sir?
What is that?
What, sir?
I remember you.
Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
It's going to be a long winter.
It's going to be a long spring.
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
On a lot of lithium?
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Yes?
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Uh huh.
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
I can't.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Dorsia's nice.
Nice?
Eight?
Pick me up?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Yes.
This is Dorsia?
Yes, dear.
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
Pull out.
I'm ignoring you.
Pull out, goddamnit!
What do you want, Courtney?
It's a plain end, see? So?
Take it off.
Why?
Oh God, just get it over with.
You and...Luis?
Yes, Courtney?
Yes?
Nothing.
You just haven't been looking.
Would you like to see my apartment?
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
Alright.
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
It's not that nice.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Evelyn?
Yes, darling?
Is your Evian spiked?
We should do it.
No-I can't take the time off work.
He's rich.
He's good-looking.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
Everybody has a great body now.
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
It's not.
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
Yes, I am.
We never really shared one.
You're inhuman.
I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.
I'm just leaving.
But where?
I have to return some videotapes.
How did you guess?
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
No.
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
No, he doesn't.
Are you sure?
You saw the ad in the Times?
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
I won't...don't worry.
What exactly do you mean?
The message you left.
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
Why not, you stupid bastard?
Now, if you'll excuse me.
It looks so soft.
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Jesus lives, Luis.
Where are you going?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
What? CARRUTHERS  I'll call you.
It looks that way, doesn't it?
Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.
Maybe it's just the light.
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
New card. What do you think?
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
Leaving what?
This.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.
Oh really? That's great.
I said we are totally booked.
Two at nine? Perfect.
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
After six.
Negative. Cancel it.
Just...say...no.
Just say no?
Thanks, Patrick.
Patrick?
Ye-es, Je-an?
Detective Donald KIMBALL?
Can you bring Mr...
Yes, Patrick?
Well, isn't this a coincidence.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
You didn't give them a name.
They know me.
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
No, not really.
Forget it.
What's that?
Jean? What?
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Patrick? Is that you?
Where are you?
Jean-I'm not-
Patrick? I can't hear you.
What are I doing?
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
Why?
Just...say...no!
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!
A model? An actor?
No. Flattering, but no.
Well...
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
Yeah.
Uh huh?
She's from...France.
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
Why would I?
Who?
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Does he do this all the time?
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
No. I'm okay.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
No, I'm okay.
Oh no, I'm okay.
It's no problem
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
No, really. I'm okay.
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Where did you go to school?
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Your address?
Thanks.
Who do you ask?
You seem...nervous.
I know. I'm sorry.
No, I guess it's okay.
You sure?
No problem. 
What do you mean...Yale thing?
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Do you feel that way?
No. Not really.
Where did Paul hang out?
Hang...out?
Yeah. You know...hang out.
No, he just hung out there.
And where did he go to school?
We were both seven in 1969.
So was I.
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
But...has anyone seen him in London?
Hmmm.
Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.
No.
People just...disappear.
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
Wait. That's not what I've got.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Let's see...  That you were with-
Well, I could he wrong.
Not a big music fan, eh?
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
Not in the mood, I guess.
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
I've questioned him.
Marcus?
Yes.
I checked it out. It's clean.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
Where was Marcus?
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
So who was he with?
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
I'm so hungry.
I'm so hungry.
Listen, what's your name?
Al.
Speak up. Come on.
Al.
I can't...I can't find a shelter
I've been great. And you?
It's...it's...all right.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
Oh well, you know.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
Cecelia is, well...you know 
Yes, Owen?
Is that a raincoat?
Yes, it is.
Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
'Gonna wait outside.
You know what I mean.
I can paint anywhere.
Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
Didn't you visit the campus?
No way. You have this -- destiny.
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
You saved my life in alot of ways.
We're not gonna let it.
I know, I know.
You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
Teddy was killed last night.
What're you -- what?
It was a hate crime.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
You think I don't know that?
Milo. Why would he --
You can't just walk in, either.
So you believe me?
Nothing?
Remember Lyle Barton?
Poor baby. You know that's not true.
...Different?
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
Don't we have any chopsticks?
Oh, right. Hold on.
Great.
It's gonna get cold.
Right. Wait. A toast.
That'll be a test, won't it?
I don't think he knows how.
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
Have a seat.
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
And Outpost? You're happy there?
'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
Gimme the coordinates?
Is it your dish?
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
We tried!
Oh hi.
He's pretty tight with his family.
We could move 'em up here.
Oh. No thanks.
There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
...Do I?
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
That's what I told her. My wife.
Maybe I'm going too fast.
You're making me young again.
Well -- you sent for me.
Right... Right.
What're you implying.
Nothing!
Definitely.
Talk about work? Never!
I meant did you find other stuff to --
You've been coming in early.
34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
You look a little tired.
I'm okay. It's going well!
'Have a look?
'Sorry about the late notice...
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
Maybe we should all get on it.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
Just do what I'm asking!
Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
Let's go.
Longitude 109 --
Wait... He knows.
What?
Just do it.
You do?
I mean, it's your life.
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
We'll come up with the next big thing.
...You wanna work -- here?
Got out of my other commitment.
Keep looking.
What're we looking for?
Any irregularity in the pattern.
I'm calling Gary.
Where we going?
You know my name.
You know mine.
You're famous around here.
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
No. Please.
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
Long story. Not that interesting.
Why would you do a thing like --
They'd frame him.
He's out of prison?
Hmm?
What?
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
I don't know --
Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
What'd he say?
"A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"
Thank God.
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
You'll come up with something.
Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
Bring it to the other location.
But you said the other --
Let's try #2.
Uh. Not exactly.
What? Come on. Is it serious?
Did you tell Alice?
Oh we're not going to the campus.
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
Speaking of which...
Yeah, yeah.
Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
I could get it out of him.
You're not listening.
We're too late. Take a look.
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
Groovy.
Or sometimes not at all.
Care for some saki?
Sak-i it to me!
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
To my health.
Kiss me.
Yes.
Hey, how are you?
Hungry.
Thank you.
Be careful.
Thank you.  Let's go, baby!
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Be careful.
Oh, and Austin...
Where is Vanessa, by the way?
Yes?
There's one more thing, Austin.
Yes?
Be careful.
Thank you.
Excuse me?
What?
That's not your mother, that's a man!
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
Yes, Basil?
Be careful.
Thanks.
Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.
Well, you can't always get what you want.
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
Why not? It's a question.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
Man, you are one chilly square!
My wedding tackle.
I'm sorry?
Do I make you horny?
What?
Do you want to talk to him?
Let me see.
How do you know?
I never forget a pussy... cat.
He's too well-protected right now.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
I couldn't have another bite.
Why?
No, this is me in a nutshell.
Oh, yes you are.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
No, did you use a condom?
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Not in the Nineties.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
You know who.
Not now, Austin.
Fair enough.
Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.
Don't worry!
Lay it on me.
I love you, Austin.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
Behave!
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
Danger's my middle name.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Here, have a piece of gum.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.
What's its current position?
That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.
Right. Okay. Moving on.
Yes.  Scott!
Right.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
Please allow me to demonstrate.
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
What did you say?
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
How's Austin?
He's asleep.
You didn't...
Why?
Did you ever want to?
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
We don't judge here.
I don't wanna take over the family business.
No, he's really evil.
Scott.
OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Red ...
Black...
... death ...
Love...
... death ...
... power ...
... preserve...
Secret ...
... love...
Hope...
... love ...
Fear ...
... love ...
Peter ...
Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
Have we met?
You mean you don't recall??
Promised? Who promised?
There, look!
Mr. John Steed, please.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Impossible?
As you see.
Then you can't come in.
I have an appointment.
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Really -- what happened in 1922?
Eh? In here!
We have met ...
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
People, too.
Then who wins?
Looks like rain, Steed...
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
We want to help...!
A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...
Next assignment?
Thanks, Valentine ...
An unholy trinity ...
Of course. I planned that, too.
Oh, no, Emma. They've only just begun ...
Valentine, listen to me ...
Choices?
I'll never marry you.
I had a spot of bother at the door.
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
Mother?
We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
I had a feeling you would. Touche!
Yes indeed. I need protection.
Thank you, Trubshaw ...
Do you really think so?
That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
For a man in my position --
I meant me.
Small talk.  Try the weather.
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
Did you say formal? I must dress.
I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
How on earth can you tell?
Is that written in his shoe?
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
She had this in her mouth. There, there...
Is there anything that isn't?
That's what we were working on.
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
Mrs. Peel ... ?
Orders.
To kill me?
Nothing personal.
No trouble.
Always.  Except ...
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
Is that all?
Not for a moment.
You're playing games.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
I thought you played by the rules.
I'm playing to win.
Winning isn't everything.
You don't trust me?
As far as you trust me.
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
You'll find out.
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
You didn't tell her?
It's called Black Leather.
Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
Where are you going?
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
What kept you?
The plot.  Hello, we must be going ...
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Still a bit chilly ...
As a matter of fact I have ...
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Pity your mother came, too ...
Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
Half-brother to be precise.
Makes two of us.
Getting to what?
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
I shall need a small plane.
You're not venturing alone, surely.
We want Mrs. Peel.
Dead, I'm afraid.
How did you guess?
Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
Possibly. Split personality ...
Insane ... ?
You.
Mother and Father know best.
I think so, thank you so much ...
This way ...
No, please! I beg you ...
Walk over to the window ...
Let it be rain, please let it be --
Stay by the window. By the window.
Perish the thought.
I was at Harrow ...
But did they teach you this?
You wish.
That's not playing by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
If you say so.
I do.
Did I? My mistake.
You are, and it's behind you.
Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for --
Debbie's marrying Rick.
...Really?
Really -- you went with him for two years.
Check out the other guy's buns.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
Yeah. What is it?
You're kidding.
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
Bond... James Bond.
Cole...
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
No.
Not interested.
Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
Oh, come on, just a little.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
The best.
I love that car.
I'm very happy for you two.
Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
So does Debbie.
Maybe it had something to do.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
Fine. How's everything going?
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
Thank you, sir.
I've tried to change her mind.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
No, Cole, I...
I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.
But a fabulous cook.
What are we having?
Are you going to have women at your party?
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Oh... I got something for that.
What's the matter?
I don't know... I just feel scared.
Um... that's very relaxing.
Can't I just go with you guys?
You're really pissing me off.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
C'mon, I knew it was you.
Rick, you're lying!
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
You're on.
Yeah.
Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.
I know what I'm doing... Go!
You know your father enjoys his company.
Ilene, we don't really know that.
I hope those guys are all right.
I think I screwed that one once.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Okay. Nice to meet you both.
What are you talking about, asshole?
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
What are you...
That's more like it.
Screw you...
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
You're a pimp?
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
I want women.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
Good.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
Really?
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
I couldn't find any razor blades.
All right, who serves?
Rick!
Oh, no!
No. Let's at least finish the set.
You've been having strange sex...!
No, Brett, I...
It's all right...  So have I.
Mrs.?
I'm separated.
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
Olivier's in that, right?
Then it's on to the real thing.
C'mon. I insist.
My gift to you.
Under the table!
The best table in the house.
So long, Father.
About what?
Right in there, pal.
I don't know.
What's this?
Got me.
Still drawing a blank.
Very.
Take care.
Who's your friend?
I'm saved. Let's party!
Debbie.
My Debbie?
What's with her costume?
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
Be gentle.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
Yeah...
We're gonna be okay, man...
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
He's alive.
Just come down, John. Just --
It's comin' along... want a beer?
What, you've never seen one before?
In the Field Museum once.
It works.
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
Sheep don't count.
Yeah? What about Laura --
That was never proved.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
I'm in heaven, Lt.
-- Never mind.
Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
Hey.
What, are you kidding? By myself?
Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.
Thanks for the insight.
Brian, look --
Just leave me alone, okay?
So hello.
Saw what?
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
How do you know?
I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
Oh shut up, huh?  I think I broke my goddamn arm...
I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
Jennifer.
You're back.
You look great.
Thanks for calling.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
Yeah? What have you been up to?
I work for city hall.
Really? No kidding.
When I was twenty.
Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
How's it going?
Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
You think that's really any of your business?
Well, you did invite me here.
Marty did.  But I wanted you to come to.
In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
Got anything to drink in there?
Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
Hi.
You could check. It'd be in his files.
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Just take it.
That's a dumb thing to say.
You're right.
What'll you do?
I don't have the slightest idea...
I'll see ya around, huh?
It's a small town.
I don't have a story.
Sure you do.
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
Pest control.
What are you listening to?
I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM!
Did I say thanks?
No.
Just wondering.
You look like... Brian.
Four months?
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Nice boat.
What the hell are we waiting for?
Engine 115, right?
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Coffee sucked.
Cute.
Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
I'm busy.
He just wants to --
-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
I'll be there.
I'll be there, goddamn it!
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
Fixing my roof.
It's not your roof anymore.
He's got piano lessons.
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
Sorry I hit Jackson.
He treats you okay?
I treated you better.
You treated me like shit.
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
What's wrong?
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
There's something else kinda interesting...
McCaffrey, hold this for us.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
Didn't think you'd make it.
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
He works for me.
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
You like everybody, Ronald.
I know you.
Tell him about me, Shadow?
-- Burn them.
And the world -- the whole world.
The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.
What do you listen to, Stephen?
You don't know... nobody knows...
I might.
I need that report, Lt.
Investigator Rimgale.
Alderman.
No Marty, I don't.
Just catch the son of a bitch.
Investigator...
Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
Those fucking Mob assholes.
Yes.
I was gonna bring it back myself.
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
I know.  Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be cool.
Me?
I want 15 on the Mets.
How about 7 1/2?
Yeah. I'm sure.
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
What money?
Don't bullshit me.
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
B-L-A-K it is.
Did he gots to be.
Yo Black, you looking for trouble.
Ho!
Louder.  They can't hear you.
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Give me some?
BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
What do you do?
Why are you smiling so?
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
She's also moorish.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
Must be the pressure.
In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.
Look at my lips.
What are you talkin' about?
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
I'm out.
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
You can walk away.  We both can.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
De-la-croix.
Manray needs a job.
You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
And this is Manray.
That can be done.
Did we get our bill yet?
And I'm the feet.
DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
EUREKA!!
Some tap dancing, some singing.
Where do I sign?
You're now Mantan.
Mantan!!
I won't do it anymore.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Yep, you guessed it.
This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
We think so.
Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
I want to speak with you.
Go away, unless you got my money.
It's me, Peerless.
It's been a long time.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
I didn't mean that, in life.
Always keep 'em laughing.
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
So he drank himself into a stuper?
It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
Manray!
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
Do you know how you will use him?
Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
You getting cold feet?
I'm in till the end.
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
This is Cheeba.
Which one is your brother?
The big one.
Break a leg.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
What do you want me to say?
Just don't lie to me.
The pleasure is mine.
I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
A gift.
For what?
I thought it was appropiate.
Is that good or bad?
I don't want to hear it.
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
He's just playing big brother.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
Please don't go there.
And that's how you got me in the first place.
I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
Hi, Mona.
I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's "LAUGH-IN."
Naw.  I'll take the zero.
You feel good, not nervous?
I feel fine.
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
You sound like the media.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
What you did is dead wrong.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
I said no such thing.  All I said is that something must be wrong.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
I'll be right over.
Yes he did.
Where is he?
I can't go all the way down south.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
Not at all?
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
The best defense is offense.
Thank you.  And always smile.
You've never had any formal training, either?
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
What do you mean?
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
And this is my very best friend Mantan.
...the big apple, New York, New York.
To come back to our roots.
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
The one with da big...
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
That'll work.  I just bought one for myself.
I thought you got rid of...
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...yes she did.
...I heard different, thought that was...
...not that time...
...too early...
...then what about...
...too late, maybe around...
...perfect...
...like grits and butter...
...like fried and chicken...
You slept too near where you got in?
I slept too near where I fell out.
You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
I don't know who I am.
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
A song a comin' I feel.
Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
Enough.
What do you want to know?
The good stuff.
Just a little something' somethin'.
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
You don't read, do you?
Never read a book in my whole life.
Maybe you need to start.
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
We can look out for ourselves.
For what?  He left.  Not me.
My people love me.
What?
You look beautiful like that.
And what?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Just ask me what you want to know.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Say what, Manray?
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
Why don't you answer?
I know I won't be your puppet.
You can go now.
I wuz leaving anyway, for good.
Good morning.
That is none of your business.
I never was more in earnest.
O'Grady.
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers.
I have acted as I think fit.
Sir, I'm a British officer.
Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
I will let down the steps for your honor.
You are going to drive to the frontier.
All Europe shall hear of this!
As you please.
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
Yes, sir.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
For whom else have you worked?
Only the agency of servants.
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
I believe they will deport you.
I have faced that problem before.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
Have you had one?
Not even that.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
It is my only object.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
As much as possible?
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
All right, five hundred guineas.
Yes!
The Prince left him only that choice.
What is to be done?
Yes, of course.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Good night, my little darling.
Papa?
Yes?
Yes, he's fine.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Dark Valdez.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
He is only curious to know who you are.
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
Yeah, if you've slept.
Who?
What do we do?
Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
Fine.
Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
Can anybody hear me!
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
I don't know!
Shut up, Mueller.
Shut up.  West's dead.
I asked for a policeman.
I just don't like it.
What do you like then?
They're dead, aren't they?
I'm not telling you what happened.
Tell me about them.
That'd be my reaction too --
He's lying.
Yeah, we know, Pike did.
You saw West's body.
Of course --
You wanna bet?
Do what?
Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
The creek bed --
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
How do you know that?
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Your weapons, Sergeant.
West... he's dead.
So did we. Why didn't you come?
I...
West's. Any kindling for afire?
We just want to check your pack --
Do I?
Yeah...
You hated West more than any of us.
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
You're the only one missing a grenade.
Mueller.
Oh, come on --
Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
Look in my pack.
Why?
Just look. Little pocket.
Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
Full clip to the body --
From up close or far away?
His chest was hamburger --
But not the only victim, right?
I didn't kill him --
Then who did?
No. Poetic justice, though.
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
Because I was standing next to him.
Where are they!
Maybe --
MAYBE WHAT --
Maybe he...
And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
Home, I'm done.
What about the confession?
Does Osborne agree?
Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
The Senator...
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
You knew Sergeant West?
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Yes.
Move him.
Why?
Is Dunbar cute?
That is the most unprofessional --
Something like that.
You made me look like an idiot --
You're right. We should sit in silence.
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Best time for banal chit-chat.
I lost a bet.
You're off to a late start.
So noted.
Not the happiest of memories?
I don't think that has anything to do with --
I don't know.
Watch me.
What?
Little bit.
Let's go talk to Bill...
They got their stories straight.
What?
Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
You couldn't have known --
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
You wanted to get the truth.
So did I.
Get in.
Isn't this how your story goes?
No death certificates. No crime.
Seven.
You're a good man, Hardy.
Really.
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Nah.
Want company?
The faggot speaks.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
Oh, you remember now --
No one else heard it?
Because he'd shot Mueller.
But you didn't see it, right?
We've been making progress, I see.
Wait --
What.
Wrong answer --
Childs.
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
I used it to start the fire --
We're not going anywhere.
You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right.
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
Then it's unofficial.
No --
The army kicked you out for drugs...
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
Who is she? Where does she live?
Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
Good luck, kid.
Edward Bloom.
Yes.
Not yet.
I don't expect to.
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Fine, you do it.
Fine, I'm doing it.
I brought it.
Let's see it.
Don.
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
Thirty years. Maybe more.
How would you describe him?
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
What did she look like?
Well, she... uh...
Was she nekkid?
Eighteen.
I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
How did you know?
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
I see. I thank you for your time.
I can get it. I can just...
Please. Go. Just go.
I'll...
Go.
I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
I was dreaming.
What were you dreaming about?
Can I take your picture?
Well, it's not a short one.
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
You were talking about your wedding.
Karl.
Okay.
Beats me.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
Am I?
You learned from the best.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
She was a witch.
Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
You owe me three-fifty.
Really.
There's a lot you don't know about me.
You know where the chemicals are?
Oh, so you know.
Son?
Can we talk?
What?
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
The river?
How I go.
You say...
The River!
Story of my life.
They're your favorite flower.
How did you get so many?
Go out with me.
There is no softer ground than town.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
I can't imagine any place better than here.
I'm robbing this place.
'Fraid so.
Hello.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'll help you.
I need to lie down for a bit.
I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
I do.
Probably tonight.
You don't have to.
I'm going with you.
They met at Auburn.
But it's romantic.
Mmm, what?
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
I need you on my side.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
He's up with your father.
You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
Yes. But that's a different...
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
Do you know who that is?
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
Yes?
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
You know what for.
No I don't.
I paid for those guitar cases.
There's over eighty thousand here.
What do you mean?
Yes.
We'll stop then.
That's not a burn.
It is. I did it cooking.
Yeah.
Thank you.
What are you doing here?
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
I'm asking what you're here for.
He says he feels safe here.
Yes. I know.
Good. 
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
You must have a visa or something...
You're asking for my documents?
No, no...
Uh. Do you like England?
Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
Oh nothing.
Tell me.
No. It is too judgmental.
Tell me what he said.
Do you believe in love?
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
You can stay tonight.
John.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
He wants the money from your bank.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
I'm so sorry.
Leave her alone.
Yes.
Right. Okay. Good.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
Yes.
Yes.
Sorry?
Happy bath day.
Syevodnya
Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.
Yes I know.
They go.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
They go.
I don't want to know.
In the world.
I do. I want to very badly.
So you're just going to be vindictive
In every sense. If at all possible.
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
What?
What? No you're not..
No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
What?
I don't have any money.
I don't want to talk about him.
It's none of your business.
Excuse me?
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
Shut up. I'm not listening.
You don't want to talk about it.
And. It's wrong.
And who says what is wrong.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
Sometimes which?
Sometimes neither.
Some... What does that mean?
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
You...
You didn't mind too much.
You don't understand you either.
Get out
You are throwing me out.
What? I... I wasn't saying...
Please, there's no... Oh.
I wasn't saying anything.
Well what have you got?
Have you had any before?
No.
Are you scared?
Not really. Maybe a little.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
I've got news for you. It's not working.
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
Except for Small Eyes.
Except for Small Eyes.
What was her name?
No. I think I better just go.
Okay. Thank you.
Whatever.
Please. Why not?
Because it was a lie.
Goodbye.
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
Please.
It's not mine either.
It's what you came back for.
No. What? No. I know.
It's more like a date.
It's a long way to go for a date.
Maybe you will find out.
Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
Thanks.
Just wanted to see.
Then start taking them seriously.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh! Gave me a start.
Yes?
I need to uh...
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
You take her to a doctor?
Oh, she older than that.
Not if no one finds out.
When? Now? Oh. No.
I need ya help again.
Can I come in?
Hey.
No, ma'am.
Well, that makes it easier.
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
Yeah.
Make yourself at home. You done it already.
I got others.
You don't got half what Tehronne got.
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
I begged him not to go. And he did.
Yeah.
Better than what you give.
Rose... please...
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
How long... how long I been out?
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
Well I don't...
Wait. He left.
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Why you got me chained?
No ma'am.
In my house, you watch that lip...
Whose doin' is that?
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
I said... STOP!
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
Well, get to it.
You drink whiskey?
We drinkin' buddies now?
To freedom.
No joke.
The... chain helps.
I'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.
Nothin'.
You can handle it.
I guess you have.
Don't think that'd be wise.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
Get a good picture in your mind.
Well, this one's yours now. You ready to take care of it?
Maybe I won't.
Shit. Who hasn't?
Why you say that?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
He tapped that.
Naw!
Go ask him.
Like I told you.
You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?
I told you to TURN BACK!
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
Then what?
We ain't here to talk about that shit.
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
Get me ten bags of mulch.
Yes'sir.
That's right.
Rae...
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
What?
Yeah, I do.
Yeah.
I just wanted some make-up.
All that shit's on aisle 5.
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
Eh, if the bootie fits...
Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.
Home.
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
Let go...
Get rid of it.
Why?
-- I should tear your head off.
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Who do you think the Jap is?
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
The Wolf?
Maybe we should do something?
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
Where is the subway station, please.
No.
Number five with a bullet.
You didn't take, did you...?  You hear things.
In Rome, I'll bow.
Nick, we can't just --
I said let's go, Charlie.
First decent idea you've had.
You said that in the last two places.
I hope not.
Maybe we should bail?
I don't think he'd feel it.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
What'd she say?
Cool?
You all right?  You okay?
What does Charlie mean?
Hey, all right.
High spirits, desire, commitment.
You'll take care of that.
If you give me one.
I wasn't expecting you.
Where would you look for the mafia?
That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
Give us a break...
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
Why the hell not?
I don't, that's all.
I couldn't keep up.  My shame is complete.
Yeah...
I can see that.
I stole them.
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
There she is!
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
Are we getting married?
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
Ichiro --
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
Good.  Very good...
You were too far behind.
Shut-up.
Not without a small army, Nicklaus- san.
A resort city, Beppu.
I want to go talk to him.
I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
Big enough.
It's illegal, Nick.
Let's go.  Him first.
Nick, you can't do this.
I can't...
Kampai.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
I couldn't tell.
Joyce?
I don't know.
We need the plate to negotiate with.
Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
A wife.  She left.
I'm sorry.
Me too.
Luck.
Why's that?
Yes...
We can't lose.
There was a change in plans.
Gaiijin?
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
You have a helluva way of asking for help.
You have a helluva way of answering.
I don't think so.
I paid for that.
Unavailable.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
You could fake it.
He drinks.
He's got a reason.
You met her.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
I don't remember you saying no.
Who am I supposed to be?
The cheese...
No one's keeping him here.
What if I chant?
Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
I'm taking you back.
Guess I'm on a roll.
She's such a long way home for you.
Time, I've got plenty of.
I'm amused.
Don't be.
Then take it from him.
This by this...
Dope?
Not in that company.
What...?  What if I say no?
He was my partner.
It is not allowed.
We're police officers.
You're foreigners.
Twenty-four hours, detective.
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
Goodbye, officer.
He'll be dealt with.
I'll pay you.
You want him dead too.
After a court convicts him.  He belongs to me.
We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
If he won't cooperate?
Anywhere.
Not to be trapped.
You underestimate the trap, Mary.
That wouldn't be very sporting.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
And what can he do for you?
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Would you like to be modified?
Had in mind something a little more radical.
Death.
Come here.
Also extraordinary things.
You're just all so... so different.
You're androids.
Nexus - 6.
Like what?
Like...
You could help us.
He could?
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
This afternoon.
Thank you.
Just thought I'd...
He's not ready yet.
When?
Tomorrow, he says.
Hello, glad to meet you.
Garbage man?
You didn't like her!?
She's not with you?
Who.
Go.
Your customer, eh?
Soon as I finish the job.
When might that be?
Day after tomorrow.
Oh!  Day after tomorrow.
Why, yes, of course.
You start.
What about a summary then.
I think we're through for the night.
Not if it works.
And what in your estimation works?
The umbrella.
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
Longevity is classified.  No.
It's okay.  Forget it.
But I would like to buy you drink.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Shot of vodka, please.
Thank you very much.
My pleasure.
Prosit.
Sorry, don't have the time.
No problem.
Prosit.
No thanks.
I like you too.
One more, eh?
I gotta piss.
I don't know.
No.  I got a problem.
Let's hear it.
I'm taking a piss.
No rust?
Yeah?
Too old.
Yes?
Can I come in?
Who?
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
For holes.
You mean the snake.
Does it eat?
Come on.
Of course not.
Why should I be?
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
Why not?
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
In your opinion.
It would be my child.
Sounds like you speaks from experience.
I think you need more help than you've got.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Can you?  I couldn't.
What do you want me to do?
There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
You did?
Me and my dad.
Where is he?
Dead.
Oh.
Not too good.
If they are smart, they take naps.
Yeah.  Sometimes.
I wish I could.
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
But then how can you...
I never felt better.
You mean a woman?
Uh-huh.
What's a long time?
Ten years.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Just wait here.
What?
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
Holden got hit.
Black?
Please.
The machine works.  She is.
Almost through.
Sorry.
Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.
What desert?
But how come I'd be there?
Know what a turtle is?
Of course.
Same thing.
I never seen a turtle.
I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
Pris.
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
Hi.
I don't have one.
They left.
What about friends?
I was hoping you'd say that.
You scared me.
Just better.
Beautiful.
Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
What's that?
Is that why you're still here?
Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.
I keep a lot of provisions right here.
You're all so perfect.
You like it?
Bravo!
Thank-Q!
I'm Adam Webber.
He's really funny!
Your mom was a dancer?
How do you do?
My office.
Well, that depends...
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
Are you French?
No, you get out of here.
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
I just had a mental picture of...
Here, pick these up!
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I don't know. Why doesn't it?
Yes, I'm right?
Right.
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
Nope.
And that's it?
Yes.
What is it?!
Perry?
Okay, okay!  Take it easy!
Oh, I could die...
Over this?
You are one scary son-of-a-gun.
I know a short-cut.
Take it. damn it!
Okay.
I haven't brushed yet.
Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
Thank-Q!
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Why doesn't it never work out?
How long would you need me?
Two weeks.
What's the pay?
What's fair?
Who are these people?
My Mom and Dad.
Very funny, smart ass.
What?
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
I guess we'll need another locker.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Then forget it.
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
This is for me.
Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
Yes.
What for?
Because I want to get married.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
The big one!
It does?
Sure.
I didn't know that.
Everybody's divorced.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
Two weeks.
Thank you.
The engine is still running.
Yes, ma'am!
Stop that ma'am crap!
Sorry!
You said it would be easy!
Is this your house?
Yes!
I like it.
Thank-Q!
Sure.
Uh...yeah.
So, what are you seeing?
That's boring!
Yeah.
Do I look crazy?
Yes!
I like her.
No way.
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962--
I'm sorry.
Eve, I'm sorry.
But, Eve, I would--
Goodnight!
Well, you had better!!
Thanks.
Is that what you call it?
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
Yes, it is.
Gee-ma-nee!
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
Yes, sir.
Of course!
I've got to go, now.
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
The front door is open.  Will you be back?
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
No, son. A pitcher.
Like one of Mom's?
Because he must!
Blow out the candles!
Your mom made that all by herself.
Merci!
Yes, father?! Yes?
...the pipe tobacco.
Yes, sir.  Is that all?
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
I promise. Is that all?
Well, in that case...of course, son.
Uh-huh.
Yes, sir. It's true.
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
You nut!
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
Really?  Since when?
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
Russia.
Juneau.
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
Sorry, that's the largest city.
Yeah.
It's so small.
You don't have a computer in your cabin?
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
That would knock my father out.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Yes. He likes windows.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
I'm not wearing his pants.
Why not? He has great pants.
I just don't want to.
Okay.
The recovery is very impressive.
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
Okay. Thank you, my friends.
No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
So, did you buy a movie?
Yeah...Seems to.
Goodbye.
Bye, Adam!
And thanks for always being happy!
Of what?
The hotel.
My father is a genius.
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
Thirty-five.
You don't look thirty-five.
How old do I look?
Twenty-five? Around there.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
The sky!!!
The sky?  Where?
Up there!!
I don't see anything!
Just look!!
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Say what?!
How do you do, ma'am.
I do alright.
Good!
Hi.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
Well, we're here to help!
Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
Yes, ma'am.
Sorry, Mom!
I'll be all right.
You're my brave boy.
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Well, where are you --
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
Yes.
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
Yeah.
Good god.
Yeah.
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
Well, put it down and come in!
You bet, hon!
I never know anymore.
Yes.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
To you maybe.
The locks.
The locks?
Then after that it's safe.
It's safe.
To go up.
No.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
Really?
Would you like a tranquilizer?
I told you! I've got everything!
What?
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Honey?
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
I've noticed.
What shall we call him?
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
If I...you know...
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
Right here!
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Yes.  Well... yes.
What?
Hi.
Coming!
And I made these!
If he tells, it won't come true!
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Yeah. Let's dig in!
Yes...
Sure.
I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey?
Just open the door.
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
Yes! That's right!
Yes.
I don't believe it!
We do?
Yes.
I want him to at least see the sky!
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
--do as I say!
Yes, dear, I know.
What can I offer you, Eve?
What are you doing here?
I forgot some of my stuff.
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
Oh, my God...
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
That's what I'm sensing.
I think...it...works.
Let me show you the entire trousseau!
Always good advice.
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
Uh..he might of.
We did not leave together.
Who did he leave with?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
To bed.
To bed?
What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn minute!
Or have perfect table manners.
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
What?!!
Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!
Coward!
What?!
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Give it back to him.
And if we can't find him?
We'll find him.
Yeah! That's thinking.
Then what?
We came back to the house!
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
Where?!
Stop!
Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
Buy it from me?
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
I've seen a few.
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
It's blue. Blue velvet.
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
No, not at all.
Who knows you have these?
Only you and the photo lab.
You're all through with this now?
Yes sir. I sure am.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Yeah.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Jeffrey nothing.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
THEN WHAT?
Then you got undressed.
I, I don't know.
What do you want?
Yes.
Lie down on the bed.
Sure I'm alright. 
I'll go then.
No.
It's okay. It's okay.
See my nipples?
Yes.
No, please. I won't.
Yes, I like you.
You don't?
No. What is happening?
Yeah, hurry up though.
I, uh.
Frank? Can you stand up?
Who's it, you mean.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
No.
Don? Are you in with them?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Please, please stay.
Hello.
Frank is coming?
Sure I do.
Are you a bad boy?
Whatiya mean?
I want you to hurt me.
Frank would open you.
Shut up.
Beeeee careful.
Come on Dorothy.
Do you love me?
I asked first.
Sometimes I think I do.
No, it's not Don.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
You what?
I did. Are you?
Yes.
You look beautiful to me.
No.  Hi baby.
My secret lover.
Who, Dorothy?
Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
Don? Where is he?
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
Alright, suit yourself.
He's comin' back? What for?
Hello, daddy.
My bourbon.
Mommy's here.
Baby wants to fuck.
Then, shut up!
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Those are my breasts.
Can I feel 'em?
If you want to.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Speak to me Fucker.
No thanks. What does that mean?
Go where?
On a ride.
Here's to Ben.
What?
Nothing.
What kinda beer do you like?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
This is it.
Be right down.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Do you want the car?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Of course, Jeffrey.
Would you like a piece of cake?
No. No thank you.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
That sounds great!
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
I'll get a coat for her.
Are you feeling okay?
It's good to see you, Dad.
Good deal Dad.
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
How is Central these days?
Terrible boring.
What else is new? Right?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
I don't know. He moved away.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
I don't know.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
I'm here, aren't I?
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
Let's go.
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Two.
I'll drink to that.
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Okay, yeah, call.
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
He got a little jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Yes.
Did you see her undressed?
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
Who, me? Why should it?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Okay, Sandy.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Okay, okay.
See ya tomorrow.
I'm really sorry.
What am I going to do?
You want to go talk to him?
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Jeffrey? Why?
Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
What is it?
Just some fatherly advice.
It's good to see you.
Where to?
You look beautiful.
I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
I can't dance fast.
Really?
Okay.
Frank!!!
Dorothy Vallens?
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Go ahead.
Sandy?
Go ahead!
Yeah, nice meetin' you.
You can change it if you want to.
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
The Duke?  What did you do?
Go find one.
Mother Mary, full of grace.
What did you do, Connor?
Aye.
Look under the body.
Any word back from the E.R.s?
Chest pocket.  Shit!
This is a six-shooter.
Yes.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
You think they sold me out? No way.
I-I'll tip her.
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
I know what the fuck he looks like!
What?  What, that guy?
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
We're here brother.
You gotta keep going.
Connor, is that you?
What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here.
BLAME...
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
All right, I suppose you have the right ta know.
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
I'll call you tonight, afterwards. 
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
y-y-yeah that's what he said.
me up the...
Ass!
He got beat up by a girl.
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
No pictures, either.
...so that which is good may flourish
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
What?
I'm serious.
I don't know they just always need it.
What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
Me, too.
Just like on TV.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
Yes, we are.
Then what the fuck?
Holy shit. Who? How many?
I'm strangely comfortable with it.
So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
We do not want your tired and sick.
It is your corrupt we claim.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
Okay then... let's get ya started.
Yeah?
Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
Uh... two shooters!
Fan-fuckin-tastic!
That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
Can she I.D. them?
They were wearing masks.
Of course they were. How many?
No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.
That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
How do you figure?
Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends.
Where's my cat?
You... oh god, why?
My, my...
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
It was... It was...
Really want to know?
New hitman wants to leave his mark
Twist of lemon!
Chief, what the fuck is this?
Sweet-n-low!
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Eight.
A couple of peons for the mob and...
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
I...
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
We promise.
We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
Roc. You okay?
No. You sure you're okay?
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
Hey, Murph.
Roc. You okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
No. You sure you're okay?
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
This is some crazy shit, man!
Those cocksuckers sold me out!
Y'know it is, a bit.
Well, I'm sold.
Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
What the fuck do you mean?
Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
Y-Yes my son.
Yes.
You feel?
Yes.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
I believe these young men are right.
You know them personally?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
Have you no fear of God?
God have mercy on my soul.
What do you want me to say?
How long since your last confession, my son?
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
Yeah boss?
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Making Hutch David Soul?
Right. The blond guy.
Dignan, it's --
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
He says. This is he.
This is he?
No. This is he.
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
She's an attractive older woman.
What do you think the cops have?
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
How was I ridiculing you?
Yeah, I saw it.
I'm lookout.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
Yeah, I heard that.
Five, seven, eight dollars.
Eight dollars.
That's not bad.
Hang on a second.
Yeah.
Just turn right here.
No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
Where's the other stocker?
There's another stocker, right?
We know there's another stocker.
Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
We got it. We got it.
Yeah.
Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
What do you think?
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
Because my mom gets the bill.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
Well, then cut it in half.
I keep it for emergencies.
Yes, they are.
Look at the treads on those.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
You were spoiled rotten.
I'll say it.
OK. Go ahead.
Bob?
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
Hi.
Inez, this is --
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
Which one was that?
On the left.
No kidding.
Obviously. That's a given.
Bob?
Don't worry about it, Bob.
They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.
Where was it parked?
Right here.
Maybe he just went to the store.
We said 48 hours.
This morning.
Where was I?
You were asleep.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
Can you hand me those french fries.
Would of been nice.
She doesn't need to know.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram.
Don't panic, Anthony.
I'm not. But there's --
That's not correct.
I know.
Where's the rest?
$383.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
That's what she is!
I know that. But --
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
Ah. Couple days ago.
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
What is it?
Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
Let me feel that.
Bob!
Get out of the way.
No, Dignan. This isn't --
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
OK. Mark that down.
It's like we've finally arrived.
Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
I don't think you will.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
He was all right.
Yeah. As a girl.
So do I.
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
You're all clear.
Roger.
We all set?
Hang on a second.
Take your second position.
OK. Roger.
Any activity?
It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
It's going back down.
Applejack! What's happening?
Nobody move!
Get against the wall!
Careful. Check his pulse.
I don't know.
Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him?
Let's go. Come on.
Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
I'll see you there.
What?
I'll see you there.
What are you talking about?
I'll get him.
There's not enough time.
Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
I don't think so.
Can't remember shit. CRS.
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
Yeah.
I'm not kidding.
What'd he get?
Pretty much everything.
The grandfather clock?
Nothing.
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
How big is it?
Oh, I'd say about --
Behind Bob's house.
He stole a tractor.
No. I'm not.
How?
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
Dignan, I --
Nice to meet you.
That's a sharp jacket.
Thanks.
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
What do you mean?
Take a deep breath.
It feels good.
Yes, he did.
How'd he do?
No, that door over there.
I don't want to die.
Are you afraid?
Death.
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
Anthony, I'm petrified.
It's an esoteric journey.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Who?
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
Hector woudn't do anything.
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
You could make your own cinnamon toast.
Let them fight.
Yeah. He said that.
See you, Bob.
There's a million places to hide around here.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
I hope not.
Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?
Move.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
He looked too shaken-up.
Is that OK?
I'm not playing any more golf.
Why not?
Yes. You just got to stick with it.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Why do you say that?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
No. I wasn't adopted.
Jesus Christ! No.
It was stupid.
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
I didn't do anything.
Who's got the car keys?
Temporarily.
Dies y nueve.
Cuba.
God, yes. Like silk.
Like silk?
Yeah.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
Uh-uh.
Abdul-Shabazz?
Feel this.
The front stairs.
Where were you?
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
Wait a second.
That's your friend Anthony?
Yeah.
What's he doing here?
You don't celebrate til it's over.
Bob! Get back in position!
You're the faggot.
The one and only Little Richard.
Not even for emergencies?
No.
So who's going to know?
My brother.
Let's cut the bullshit.
What are you talking about, Bob?
Can you use a coaster.
It's true, Dignan.
Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
I can't believe you said that.
I warned you, Dignan.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her.
Maybe she turned.
Let's just go.
That's your domain.
OK.
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
God DAMMIT.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
This is natural.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
Did we get it?
Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
Don't count it.
No. I was calm.
I don't want to talk about it.
Bob, I've got nightmares.
I told you they were there.
I don't know.
It's registered in my mother's name.
What the fuck possessed you?
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
See you in a little while.
My brother's in jail.
What are you talking about?
They said he's a drug dealer.
That could be anybody's.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
I don't know.
We'll have to see when we get back.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Bob, that makes no sense.
Come on, Dignan.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
I'm going back.
Not in that car you're not.
Watch me.
I can't do that, Bob.
I know it's not.
You don't even know his name.
Yes, I do.
What is it?
Just get in the car, Bob.
What's his name?
Let's go.
Not bad.
Not a whole lot, Bob.
Man, I don't want to go into this.
I never agreed to that.
Bob, you're lying!
Bullshit.
I didn't have any choice.
That's OK.
I know it, man. Hang on.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah?
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
Stand by. Bird Dog?
He's having a heart attack or something.
I think so.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Take him to the car, Bob.
Where's Applejack?
He's stuck between two floors.
Run. Run. Let's go.
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
Do you have your own cell?
Here we go.
Wait a second --
Now!
I'm working on it.
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
Right. I'm sorry.  You've got a reputation to think about.
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
I'm trying.
He said you ran away from home.
No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
And what does that cover?
Hand to hand combat?
Did you hear that?
This is no good.
The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
Why?
Well, I think --
Who? Applejack?
Why did he go that way? 
Can't get it. It won't... 
What can we do?
Where's that guy going?
He left his sweater.
Well, I left some money in there.
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
No. I just have short hair.
Is that your chiquita?
No, my friend knows her.
She Chicano, yes?
Sure.
Got a little lucky.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
Fight. You know.
You Hoto?
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
Right.
Mr. Henry?
Come on in!
It's locked.
No, it's not.
Good to know you, John.
Pleasure to meet you, John.
There was a mistake.
What?
Never heard of it.
That's not gonna fly.
I want to know about Treadstone.
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
No... It must have been Bourne.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
'Why' would be enough for me.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
Why not? It was just money.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
Had to be done.
No good options left?
Thanks.
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
Okay... 
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
I killed them.
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
I don't want you to forgive me.
You know I'm not.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
Look at me.
Because you're afraid!
Is this really happening?
I'm sorry.
Felt a little light.
Drop it.
Sorry. Old habits.
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
Conklin.
He's dead.
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
I don't know who that is.
What's going on in Berlin?
I don't know! Why would I lie?
I'm sorry.
-- my coat -- but we should --
-- what? --
Conklin up front.
I'll get the book.
No. There's nothing new.
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
-- it hasn't been two years --
I worry when you get like this.
I should be better by now.
The Telegraph office.
But we were so careful.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
He was at the campground yesterday.
We can't wait to be sure.
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
What?
Switch! You drive!
-- not yet --
-- it's just him? --
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
There must be another way!
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
Tell me later.
But you found another choice.
I did.
You do?
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
You hear me? I believed you.
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
I want to hear it from you.
What do you mean?
My first job.
Your first assignment was Geneva.
That's a lie!
You never worked Berlin...
I was here!
Bourne?
I want someone I know to take me in.
Careful...
Are you disappointed?
Sounds like a threat.
You didn't answer my question.
I'm working on it.
Who's going? Us?
Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
-- the hotel -- how far? --
What?
But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
What? The tapes?
Here?
Now. Show now.
Is there. Is all there.
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
-- shut up! -- just shut the --
Who's this?
Before this? Before Bourne? No.
Are you an expert in amnesia?
If you say so.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
Felt promising. It's a start.
Are we locked up?
And what about you, anything?
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
Peace?!
We cannot defeat this --
You've all sworn to Longshanks.
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
He will. I know he will.
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
So I did! And what was so important about it?
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
You mock us with a smile?
Hamish, I... thank...
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
Aye.
We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
I rest.
Your rest is making me exhausted.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
No. One of us is enough.
How many?
Three, maybe more!
Armed?
I wanna have supper waitin'.
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
Aye, we'll get 'em.
You win.
I should'a remembered the eggs.
A patriot!
We don't split up!
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
All men lose heart. All betray. It is exactly why we must make the choices we make.
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
Let her speak.
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
You are. And I'll come again.
I... accept your proposal!
I'm not just saying it!
Nor I!
I will be with you, like this. Forever.
...Tonight!
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
I need you so much! I love you!
Wake up, William. Wake up!
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for.
Wife of Edward, the king's son?
It's battle I want, not talk.
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
Peace is made is such ways.
SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
And I will consult with mine.
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
No English lord would trust an Irishman!
Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
But you must have something to go on?
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
You'd be surprised how often they are.
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
So what did you find.
Um... can dad come this time?
Can't he come out for one day?
But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
Great. I'll see you soon.
I... I don't remember.
Something must've happened! What set him off?
I... I blacked out.
I don't know. These things take time.
How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.
Weirder than this?
Not in this wing, actually. No.
Where are you now?
No, protecting her.
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
Are you sure? Not even with my father?
Books?
My journals! Where are they?
I thought you were a December baby.
Shhh! I need quiet for this.
Fuck off, frat boy.
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
I'm sorry.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
I've stopped a hundred times.
So how's Tommy?
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Not if you remember my dad.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
It was a long time ago.
I know, but...
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
Those are your clothes, silly.
Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
Go on. Sit down.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
What do you mean?
He's a fucking maniac!
I get it. You can drop it now.
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
Because you're... different.
Different? How?
Know what?
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
Been there, done that.
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
We'll find out soon enough.
Me neither.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
Evan Treborn.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
You're kidding. He's so... big.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
What happened?? Where are we?!
What's wrong with you?!
Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
I think I'll go check out the chapel.
Huh?
Meant no offense.
You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
Oh my God oh my God...
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
Yes?
I came with Captain Renault.
I should have known.
My husband is with me, too.
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
I thought so. Where's your husband?
Oh, yes.
-- Will he keep his word?
He always has.
Oh, yes, please.
Go back to Bulgaria.
-- He's just a lucky guy.
What is your name?
Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir.
I'm sorry. It is.
A champagne cocktail, please.
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
Monsieur Rick!
How long can I afford to stay closed?
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
I won't.
Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
-- Tonight he forgot.
Yes, I come, I will do it.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
That's all right.
I'd better be going.
Er, my check, please.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
It's not for sale at any price.
What do you want for Sam?
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
You needn't be concerned about me.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
I will.
Here's looking at you, kid.
Yes?
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
Yes, of course, we --
Especially tonight.
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
Has it got a wow finish?
I don't think I will, Rick.
The stairs from the street.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
Put them on the table.
No.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
I wish I didn't love you so much.
Oh, Rick!
Because you're getting on that plane.
I don't understand. What about you?
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Yes, ma'am.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
Won't you join us?
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
I will, don't worry.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
No, Victor, no.
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
We'll discuss it later.
He suggested I ask you.
Ask me?
-- Yes?
I love you very much, my dear.
-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
Of course, I'll be careful.
Yes.
Rick? Who's he?
Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
You're saying this only to make me go.
How do you do?
Won't you join us for a drink?
What for?
Your work.
Thank you. I try.
We all try. You succeed.
Any time.
Right.
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
I said, ask your wife.
My wife?
Thank you.
Had a close one, eh?
Yes, rather.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
But we made a deal.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
Here it is.
Yes. What is it you want?
No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
We'll be there.
Goodnight.
May we proceed with the business?
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
Good day.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.
Good evening, Captain.
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
How about New York?
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
Mademoiselle.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
But I have no excuse to close it.
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
The clipper to America.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
I was misinformed.
A wise foreign policy.
Victor Laszlo.
Victor Laszlo?
His escape.
Oh, but I just told you. --
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
Excuse me.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
-- Thanks. I will.
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
Well, it looks like you're a little late.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
Go ahead, Ricky.
Oh, he won't be followed here.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
I have. Sit down over there.
Put that gun down.
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
Uh huh.
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
I never make plans that far ahead.
Sacha, she's had enough.
-- Sacha, call a cab.
Take your hands off me!
What is your nationality?
I'm a drunkard.
I haven't the slightest idea.
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
Put that phone down!
Get me the Radio Tower!
Put it down!
Hello Ugarte.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
I don't want them here overnight.
Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me, Rick. Do something!
Yeah?
Not right now.
You ever going to bed?
No.
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Good. Then have a drink.
No. Not me, boss.
Then don't have a drink.
Boss, let's get out of here.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
No, sir. I'm staying right here.
Just a little something of my own.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
Worse than Warsaw.
Nobody remembers that.
Catch another fish tomorrow.
Feels so good to lie here.
Get up, damn you.
You've had today's water.
Thirsty.
Do too little you'll die.
Going to die anyway.
No.
Take it, damn it.
No.
Survive today, that's the point.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
I'm putting it off.
Water water water --
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
They'd eat you if they could.  They're laughing at you.  Listen.
No!
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
Die tomorrow or die today.
You are.
Nothing out there but ocean.
Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
Yeah.  A long time ago.
They're harder to do than they look.
Oh?  You've tried?
Well, I do a little drawing --
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
No.  that was the last one.
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
Sure.
Had a package to deliver.
You?  Personally?
Must be a story there.
I've got lots of time.
So do I.
Cold.
Not if you work for FedEx.
You don't seem too happy about it.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
Let me guess, Russia came up?
He's your cute thing.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
For when I travel?
You did?
I have to.
You want to.
Could you watch Jango?
No.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
There isn't any us.
Yes there is.
No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
I burned the Christmas tree.
Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
Hey...hey...it's okay!
A few things came up.  Or went down.
I thought you might have.
I would never --
I know.
If I'd known you were alive --
I would have done the same thing.
Is that Jango?
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
Not when you have no choice.
I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does.
Great.  Really.
I don't know.  I really don't know.
It means a lot...that you came.
I had to come.  To be sure you were okay.
You too.
I'm so glad you're alive.
And how was your Christmas?
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
Which I didn't have.
I most definitely say I am.
Mom, meet Jango.
It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
Oh no, the prodigal son's home.  We bring out the store bought.
The place is falling apart.
I'm doing fine.
The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
What's going on down there?
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
It was fifteen minutes late.
You fucked us over.
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
For all those vacation days you got coming.
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...
You're fucking dead!
You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!
You should have smelled me.
I braided them.
Time I had lots of.
Forty-three days.
To Wilson.
That's all there is.
Believe me I know.
Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
That's what it's about.
Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
No sweat.
Permission granted.
San Francisco.  And you?
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
You weren't dreaming about me.
I was!
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
It was just the ether, Wilbur...
They just want you to hire some new help.
Some new *things* would be useful. I don't need any "new help."
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples?
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
I'm sorry, Homer.
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
And that I can drive a truck!
Better than I can!
I doubt it. She's just an...
She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Wally said to say, "Hello."
Candy. Candy Kendall.
Two.
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
Really?
Burma!
Oh...
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
Yes! I've only seen one, though.
"King Kong". It's really good.
I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
Just a little privacy.
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
The *speaker*. For the movie sound.
Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
Right.
*What* will be okay?
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
He's *paralyzed*!
What do you want me to *do*?
Please don't...
You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
She knows how to take care of herself.
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
Why?
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
I never said they were boring.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
Well, they aren't.
Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
They wanted a girl.
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
Nobody special enough, Curly.
You mean somebody asked?
Only the right people can have you, Curly.
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
"...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939."
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
*Liver* killed him?
But did you know him?
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
Did you know your mother better?
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
What's a nanny do?
She looks after other people's children.
No. She was an immigrant.
What's an immigrant?
Someone not from Maine.
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
That's why Kong loves her!
Is that soon?
I don't remember.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered...
A B-24 Liberator.
Liberator...
Have you enlisted?
Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Where are you going?
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
It's all very normal.
*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
Migrants?
What about the trees?
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
You still doin' it too fast!
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
Yes, for both.
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
Obviously.
I don't know it.
Nobody's named this one yet.
It's my turn!
I don't think so.
You do it then.
I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
Long enough. You ain't gonna stop it.
We heard that one already, Homer.
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
It's just my heart.
I can't read. Nobody taught me.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
I don't like watching anyone be sick.
Not yet. What do you know about it?
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
But you don't look very happy.
That's it.
Now, now. He's a good boy.
Shit. We don't know what he is.
What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is...
When will he be home, Major?
Four weeks or so, right around Halloween.
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
Mind your own business, Peaches.
Sorry, Homer...
We see you next harvest.
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
I told him that you all is sick.
Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.
She took off on the bicycle, man.
He ain't never been outta Maine!
Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
Really? Wish we had met eight hours ago.
What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
Everything looks in order.
This has to happen fast.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
There'll be red flags.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
Ten percent. Of how much?
Two million.
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
Know who I am, Jake?
The Anti-Christ?
Gee... What makes you say that?
Your life flashing before your eyes?
That's not a bad place to start.
Isn't it always?
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
After you cut her loose.
She walked.
Today? Started off great...
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
Let's go, Jake?
But you won't get that splatter effect.
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
Tonight. Just me.
Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
Two million.
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
She's up for it.
Eight A.M. flight.
Calls?
We'll use the Euc.
What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
Minus one.
Why not?
Let me repeat -- Why not?
Because you killed one of my crew.
Stake you?
No thanks. I'm good.
Come here!
Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy.
Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Ring it for him, Sobo.
Good boy.
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
Help me.
You interested in a little work?
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
You get an equal cut.
What do I have to do?
Just play a part. A little acting.
I'll worry about Customs.
Don't worry about it.
And some new clothes.
Why?
I don't trust anyone.
Uh-huh.
I gotta go get a haircut.
Uh-huh.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Do you have something to prove?
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
WHAT?
You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
What about the money?
What do you want? An apology?
No, I want my cut!
Then shut up.
My place.
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
What?
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
We never had a problem with that before.
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
You sure?
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
This is embarrassing.
I'll find the time.
Keep it up.
What?
Stand up.
Eee Oott Auught!
Sorry. What?
In over your head?
Pretty much.
Huh? Oh. She's alright.
Then who's the Banker?
We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
I try.
Let's just say he burned me once.
We're here.
Peace of mind.
That's it?
Not everyone's on the take, Walter.
To who?
That's what I'm talking about.
I'm down!
High five.
Jack Manfred.
Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.
Is it that bad?
How do I look?
No. Thanks.
My car's in the garage.
Maybe another time.
It's the tension.
All men are cheats.
I got scared.
I can imagine.
Well it is. But I know where I am.
Sorry.
What are you talking about?
A couple I know are getting married.
What's the Blue Book price?
What?!
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
Seven-fifty.
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
We all played the field.
I want a job, Giles.
All right. As what?
I'm working on that soccer story.
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
Looking forward!
South African women are very sporty.
Who was he?
She.
It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble.
Not particularly.
Not entirely.
How's that football story corning along?
You mean I won't resist them.
I won't be that long.
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
I. sold the car.
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
I've got something to tell you.
I want to hear it.
I've got a job.
What job?
It came my way. 450 a week.
I love you Jack, you know that.
You've got such beautiful hands.
I don't know.
Fine.
Tension. It'll go.
Poor baby.  This'll relax you.
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
What about a drink on the way home?
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
Well, that's our life now, isn't it?
Without hope there's no point to anything.
Leave it.
No. Answer it!
I hope it brings you luck.
It will.
Not talking. Writing.
Never. Why do you ask?
Really?
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
Nothing about you.
Then what?
Leave me alone, Marion.
You're already alone.
I hate public transport.
What?
How can anyone be that naive?
Found a job?
No.
Don't let yourself down.
I won't.  Goodbye, dad.
Well, thank you anyway.
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
There's a casino in this hotel.
So why did you come to my casino?
In the casino.
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
Do you believe in astrology?
Toss you for it.
I don't gamble.
Just an accident. Nothing.
Turn left ahead.
I'll watch.
You don't like cheats, do you.
You choose.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
Then you're not a pro.
What kind of trouble?
I owe a lot of money.
Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion.
Who's they?
The point is, they want a man inside.
And I thought you were a bright woman.
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
But if it does.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
What ten thousand pounds?
What about my neck?
No, forget it. The bet's off.
I told you, all bets are off.
What for?
I have to take the car.
Yes.
Thank you.
It's all relative.  I need the money too.
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
I've still got mine.
I took the bandage off yesterday.
Jack! It's Jani.
Who...
Ross.
Who did it? Tell me!
You did?
Have I?
I'm Lucy.
And what do you do, Lucy?
Are you going to put a spell on me?
Turn left at the lights.
Over the river.
Have you got transport?
Not bad. I have other interests, of course.
I'm not going to report it.
Good call. Help yourself.
That bitch? No.
No thanks.
Don't worry, I won't report you!
I don't gamble.
Rough life, Jack.
I'll tell you later.
It was you, you shit.
I was at Beadles.
Why four? And not three or five?
It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
Any exceptions?
Give me 365.
Where's the magnet?
They've been tested.
I don't think so.
Wipe your hands.
What happens if I want to sneeze?
Five.
I make it six.
Five.
I said good call.
Ever?
I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
Yes.
Fine.
Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
All right, Mr Reynolds.
He's a good customer.
I can see.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
Bruised.
Right, that checks out here.
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
I think he's talking to it.
Key? Key? What is the key?
Where's the fail-safe key?
The key!
You must have it, you idiot, we can stop the bomb!
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
Oh, God...
It didn't go off.
Yoo hoo, bomb...
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
Pinback, throw me the chart log.
He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
I read the same here.
-- open quantum latches --
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Arm yourself, bomb.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
Huh?
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Hello, bomb.
Of course.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
But how do you know you exist?
It is intuitively obvious.
This is fun.
Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
And you can only do it once, right?
I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
So if you detonate in...
...nine seconds...
I have no proof that it was false data.
You have no proof that it was correct data.
Mafhkin oble groop...
Yes, Doolittle.
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
Yes.
Any of 'em any good?
Naah. All stable.
Who cares. Don't bother me.
Commander Powell is dead.
Wha?
Veil nebula.
Who cares?
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
-- automatic channels open --
-- Remark.
5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
Must get lonely being up here so much.
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
What's that, sir?
Negative effect.
That's correct, sir.
Well, what you might try is --
Doolittle, hello?
We're running out of time, sir.
Talk to the bomb.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Bruno's girlfriend.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Guess again.
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
That's not why we're here.
I'm outta Portland.  Sonrisa didn't want local talent.
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
None of your business.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
You know each other?
Leave.  Now.
Where?
You mean until you showed up?
You're not still pissed?
What?  Where're we going?
No time.
No way.
Don't look down.
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
I'll make it worth your while.
It's a rule.
Am I?
Every week.
SHHH!  Don't do that!
They took my daughter.
Look, I'd really like to...
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
Are we in some kind of trouble?
Mommy, where are you?
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
Soon, baby.
Girl's gotta make a living.
First time I ever heard that.
I was expecting someone else.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
You're lucky.  I almost pulled the trigger.
We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
The one you're wearing?
Girlfriend?
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
I'm not a half bad cook.
Bent.
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
That would be appropriate, yes.
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
We are not fine.
You need to get out more.
C'mere, I want to show you something.
The other one like you...
You lost me.
Your basic hodge-podge.
Hardly...
Your help.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
Open it.
Deeds, not words.  I need your help.
We're quoting Mom again.
Ladies would be elsewhere.
You don't want to.
Can't help you.
I'll wait.
A friend of your fiance's.
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
I think you should go now.
Let go of my hand.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
I'm on my way.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
I just don't go in with any expectations.
What?
You know what I'm saying.
How long you and me known each other?
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
It's a secret.
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
And because he's my friend.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
They're prisoners to their genes.
So are dogs.
Only one I can think of.
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
Not right now?  Okay, when?
You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars...
I have sincere eyes.
You get it when I get her.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
What if he's on the level?
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
Right, the big one-oh.
But I'll take a rain check...
We gotta talk.
What's up?
You left out condescending.
But there's another side--
Really?
--a philandering pig.
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
Easy Sketchy.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
Say the words, "I understand."
I want you on call here.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
For a change.
I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
Gin.
My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
No, I mean... you love your son?
More than anything in the world.
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
Pick a song, Hawk.
Got any KISS?
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
Yeah, a man's drink...
Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
It's okay.
Believe it.
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
Oh, screw it!
That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
You got in the car, didn't you?
Yeah.
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
What's in Sandusky?
One more time in English.
Plenty, but it was all bad.
Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
YO, DOOFUS!
Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them.
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
The paint!
Tickets?
Nah. Couldn't be.
And if it ain't cleaned off?
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
Hawk?
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
What's gone?
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
NOW!
Uhh... nothing.
You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
I said, I'm sorry!
Yeah.
Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
What?
You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
It's not nearly enough, punk.
The KISS Army!
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Not if I shoot first!
I don't even think you have a gun!
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
Yeah.
Good morning...
GOOD MORNING!
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
Did you know him?
Donnie.
A metal craft of any kind.
Beg pardon?
Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job.
Not until like... eighth grade.
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
Donnie! Give it back!
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
You know what? I think that you did it.
What did you say?
Our saviour...
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
You'll know soon enough.
Where did you come from?
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
You have to do something for me first.
You have a request?
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
Take it off. I want to see you.
I am so sorry.
Why do they call you Frank?
Hey...
Sure.
What makes you think I'm not?
We never would have had this conversation.
I'm sorry.
That was a compliment.
Will you go with me?
I'm going home.
Well...
You want to kiss me...
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
What?
Are you okay?
Infant Memory Generators.
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Then when? I have to talk to you.
Hey. You OK?
My mom is gone.
Where is she?
Where are we going?
No. Frank.
Who's Frank?
Yeah...
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
When did you stop taking your medication?
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
That is a terrible nickname.
Know what?
Where it came from?
You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
Grandma Death.
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away.  She was right about the rabbits. Go.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
His name is Frank.
Frank.
How so?
Don't you watch the news?
I don't own a television.
Follow him where?
I met a girl.
Gretchen. We're going together now.
Do you think a lot about girls?
I think about girls a lot.
I asked you about school.
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
What else do you think about during school?
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
Who is the boss?
Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
Can anyone else see him?
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
Is Callie still around?
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
Have you ever made love, Donald?
I... I was playing with fire.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
Yes. I went to jail.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
That I did it again.
You've done it again?
I think now that he might...
Because I'm so horny.
God exists because you're horny.
I have the power to build a time machine.
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
Then how is time travel possible?
Soon. Time is almost up.
Frank is going to kill.
Who is he going to kill?
Goodbye, Donald.
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
What's her name?
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Why would I tell Mom?
Because you tell Mom everything.
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
Everything is going to be just fine.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Frank?
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
You're not a bitch.
He was a year ahead of us?
Donnie? You're a dick.
You can suck a fuck.
Yep.
How did this happen?
I guess they made him do it.
I think we've all seen "Bonanza".
Kitty...
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism.
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
Raspberry.
No more fuckin' for her.
She's alive, sweetie.
Where is she?!
She's right over there.
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
Yeah, you betcha...
Oh-yah.
You-betcha.
Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!
Airport Ho-Jo!
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
I gotta work with these women.
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.
"Here," wh-wh-what?
Oh-you-beccha.
Huh?
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
That's my mom.  I'll get 'em in a sec.
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
I love you much.
We was robbed.
It's okay.
This, this... This is bullshit!
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
Good, 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's, it's Nazi Germany!
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Oh, I'll "get it." I'll "get it" all right. I might even take seconds.
Here, have some.
NO...  It's all right. I got it. Don't worry about it.
Bye.
Are we on "Cops" again?
You could be quiet.
This here's Loretta.
Loretta, shut it.
Oh, Christ, it's true.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
All right, they're makin' a movie.
You don't know where this is gonna...
I got a hairdo.
Okay. Take her purse.
They told me to practice.
Okay?
Mm-hm.
Dakota.
Ohio...
That bitch from...
What?
Wisconsin.
The bitch.
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
And the year before that?
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
Becky was my only shot at state!
A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
Oh, my!  Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?
You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
"Proud... to be... an... American."
What!
This is -- what?
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
I will if you shut your piehole.
Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya.
Close up shop!
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
And wear a crown and everything.
And everything.  He should be king!
Take a letter.
Who to?
The President of the United States.
"My dear President"...
Take another letter...  to my tailor.
You do and I'll fire you.
Send for my car...
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
I wanna powder my nose...
He could be playing solitaire, but I don't think so.
What's the matter with you?
What kind of a dog is he?
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
Well - what is he now?
Half watch dog?
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
What do you whistle?
Yankee Poodle.
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
No, but I shot some ducks.
I don't wanna work at all.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
Then I demand an apology!
What did you say to her?
I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
Firefly must be captured at any cost.
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
It must be done right away.
I can't do it right away.
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
And Vera niece, too.
Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
You swine!
Give me that again!
You worm!
You upstart!
Yes.
THEN IT'S WAR!
Oh -- you mean... worm?
Was it -- swine?
No... it was a seven letter word.
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
Why -- why -- of course.
Take a seat -- you're next. 
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
For you, I would do anything... 
It is every woman's problem.  Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands?  Who...
I thought everything was working out fine.
Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
Yes please, two.
One or two?
Two, please.
I've always thought that myself.
I'll join you shortly.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
Do you?
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
Yes?
I found it.
Did you see it?
What is it?
Like this. 
I'll get my bag.
I'll show you! I'll show you!
Shut up!
He fell.  He falls.
He must have taken quite a fall.
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
That's the way he sleeps. If he lays down, he'll die.  Head's too heavy.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
I want him back!
Good morning, sir.
You've acquired a taste for this?
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Don't be mad. This muck can kill you.
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
And what was that, John?
Yes, I think I can.
Of course they will. They're reasonable men.
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
I feel much better. Thank you.
Are you comfortable here?
I am very pleased to meet you.
I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day.
Three quarters of an hour.
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
Nothing of any importance, eh?
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
I knew you'd understand. Here.
Yes.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
Alas, no.
No, but I certainly shall.
Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
y-y-yes--
Want to come out?
You're English.
Yes.
Yes.
Good morning.
Where did you get this box?
The main spire.
Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
Yes John!
Yyyess.
Yyess.
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
My name is...
My... name is...
John... Merrick
Say "Merrick".
Merrick...
Say "Mmmerrick."
Mmmerrick.
Righteousness for his namesake.
Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.
Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
Yes.
The hospital?
Of course! What did you think?
Thank you very much.
Ohhh...
How is your tea, John?
Who are they of?
Oh, our relatives... the children.
The children! May I see?
Of course.
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
Here.
Good morning.
...Can you cure me?
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
Yes, John.
You did this for me?
Yes.
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
John.... how can you ever forgive me?
Yes, very soon.
I'm glad, John. Goodnight.
Then I shouldn't change anything?
No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.
You too, my friend. Goodnight.
Yes! The workhouse!
Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
A dressing bag.
Very smart indeed.
Yes. John wants it.
A dressing bag?
I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
And who might you be, sir?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
Pardon me?
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
Ah! It's my father!
Open up! I know you're in there!
Who, Father?
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
You're losing your temper!
But, Father, it IS!
I said welcome.
WELCOME?
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
Those things in your hands.
These? What are THESE? They're swords.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
Yes.
But surely you know...?
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
What was she like?
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
But you LOVED her all the same...
We never went to bed together.
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
I've never been to bed with anybody!
"The fifth one this week"!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Five this week; how many the week before?
You're as bad as my father.
And the week before that?
Halfdan the Black.
But, Erik...
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
Why?
I'll bring it back.
Erik. You don't understand.
Goodbye, Aud...
I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
Do you believe I love you?
Then let go!
The second note to wake the Gods...
There is something I must ask the Gods...
No... no...
But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
We blew the Horn Resounding.
SHE blew the Horn Resounding.
I see the world.
Is it night or day, Erik?
It is day, of course, Freya.
Is it summer or winter, Erik?
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
I will go and wake them up!
That I cannot tell you.
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
Well... isn't it great?
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
A lot of people like our singing.
I'm sure it's lovely.
But you don't want to hear it.
No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
Really.
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
Yes?
He wants to kill US!
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
The important thing is not to panic.
Yes.
What about the raping?
Shut up.
You don't love ME.
Oh, get it over with.
I don't suppose... no...
About NOT raping you...
You DON'T like it, do you?
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
Well you started it.
Ah.
Louder.
Aaagh! Rape!
Oh, thanks.
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
Why should you care?
Why... should YOU care?
Tell me your name?
Why?
I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!
I don't know! I just did!
Find it... AND cross it!
But...
What?
Come on, move it!
I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
It saved my father!
Very deep... usually...
No.
I know!
He wants to KILL us.
I know. I know.
Don't you FEEL it?
What's it all about?
What?
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
Who have you been talking to?
I met this girl...
It's always the women that start the trouble.
She got me thinking...
So? What'd you do to her?
That's my boy!
Sorry!
Make your mind up.
You may need a real Berserk.
The sun! That's it!
What "magic"?
You'll see!
Look out!
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
Now stop it!
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Well, come on!
To the oars!
Oh... I feel a little... oh...
I've got you!
No! Arrgh!
Who gets killed?
Nobody gets killed.
Just say something cheerful.
Oh... right!  Well... CHEERS everybody!
Keitel Blacksmith?
What's the matter with Bjorn?
But how could he know... unless...
But...
What are you talking about?
What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
We'd be the first!
I was sitting there.
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time.
We haven't got a spare place.
DEATH!
She MUST have a knife or something...
Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
I have to go...
Yeah... well...
You will wait?
The Dragon...
What do we have to do?
Nothing... I just immerse you in water...
Vanish into thin air?
He hasn't.
Well, where is he then?
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
No, it is NOT.
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
No, I'm not.
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
I mean many of the greatest sailors were.
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
Mum! Dad!
Got you!
What are you talking about?
I'm not worth risking your life for.
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
For your own sake... For the others... I...
I... I...
What have you got there?
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
Yes yes... of course.... the "Blacksmith's Code"...
Can't make enough axe-heads!
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
That's right.
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Together we stand!
You can't let Erik do THAT.
Well... I... I thought...
How can we stops him now?
YOU do it!
I'm drowning! Help!
You'll drown us bo...
Help!
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
I know, Dad.
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
I must only let the red rage...
Not now, Sven...
I must KILL! Kill!
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
Stop it!
DEATH TO DRAGONS!
Sh!
I'm just building up to it, Dad.
GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
Easy, Dad!
Neither am I.
Me too.
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
No... he's not... not... there...
Tell him I'm coming!
And something to sharpen them with?
Yes, Mum.
And keep your sword greased.
Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
Say hi to Naomi.
I told you that later.
Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?
Yes, please have a seat. He'll be right with you.
Hi.
Okay, I guess.
Here we are.
I was not.
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
In the world.
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
Okay, I guess.
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
Why?
Why what?
No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so...
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
I can't remember.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
Yeah, I got it.
I'm Joel.
I don't know what that means.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
I'm not nuts.
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
You're sure? It's cold.
Yeah?
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
You know Wilmont?
Yeah.
Wilmont. Near the high school.
I like to read.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
I don't know.
Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.
No, I'm okay for now.
You pick it.
You just say. I'm not really --
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
Yeah?
Yeah? Oh, great!
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
You'll call me, right?
Yeah.
When?
Tomorrow?
It's three.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Where are you going?
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
I want to have a baby.
Let's talk about it later.
You're not ready.
Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
Would you get me another, Joely?
I want to know you.
No. Thanks.
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
What do you mean?
What?
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
I love it!
This is our first "date" date.
Do you remember what we talked about?
Naomi, I guess.
What was I wearing?
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
We did talk about Naomi.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I'm sure, I said.
But you weren't. I could tell.
And I didn't have an argument.
Come up and see me... now.
It's very late.
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
Is that what you want?
I did it. I guess that means something.
Not yet. Not married.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole human race pegged.
Hi.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
You said --
I'm Joel.
What do we do?
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
I love her.
Me too. There's this poem --
Seems too coincidental that way.
Yeah, maybe.
Um, no.
Let's move into this neighborhood.
Female.
What are you doing?
It's freezing out here.
I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
Naomi.
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
I love you.
Yeah.
When?
Tomorrow?
Joel, come here. Please.
Have sex. Y'know --
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
Well, you obviously don't know me.
I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you.
A bully? Moi?
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
Doesn't sound like me.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
I just walked in.
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
Oddly enough, I do.
Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
I probably got the same thing as you.
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
You must have been crazy.
Guess what I'm wearing.
I don't know. Panties and --
Your dried cum.
Jesus.
Hi.
How's it going?
I know. I had to take the day to think.
Long day thinking.
It's too late.
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
That's your look for me.
What? What do you mean?
Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head, too.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
How was it?
In a minute.
I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
I hope you get your work done.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
I'm glad you called.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
'Night.
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Nah, I don't know.
Hi.
Sorry. I just --
It's just... y'know... I mean...
I know. Anyway --
'kay.
I better do this, Stan.
You found us okay?
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
We haven't checked.
What?
Listen, it's not erasing.
I don't know! I just said that!
You better go.
Hell no.
I swear.
Happy. Happy with a secret.
Hi.
What do you want, Stan?
Can I... I brought some --
Nothing.
I know what it is.
Then why did you ask me?
Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
Yes?
Thanks.
Welcome, Howard.
How do you mean?
You are such a sweetheart.
I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
You made me have an abortion.
It was a mutual decision.
I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
He went home sick.
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
She came to help, Howard.
Did you try going through C-Gate?
Yeah. Of course.
Oh dear.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
Then check the connections.
Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
This one's history. Moving on...
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Okay, There's more, Stan --
It's a quote book.
She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
I know who you are.
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
Clockworks.
Clockworks?
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
I'm staying with the Countess.
You don't?
About...
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
Well.... er...
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
Why? Why do you have to go?
For magazines?
Yep.
I'm the best.
You're the best?
What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
I think I found something...
This is Cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway?
EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
Coop, where are you...
The containment, Second Containment...
Hold on, Coop...
I'll get him.
It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
Coffee.
No, thank you.
I'm telling you, I saw it...
I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
It is not.
You're okay now, it's over...
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
Can you shut it down?
I don't want to go where the last crew went. I'd rather be dead.
Run!
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
Oh God...
Nothing. It's nothing.
A power drain --
90 over 50 and falling... .
He's crashing...
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
What's on your mind?
Some things you don't get over.
The dark inside me.
From the Other Place...
I built it.
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
Start the countdown.
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
Justin.
Skipper, you gotta help me...
Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
Starck, you still showing those readings?
What you got, Peters?
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
Alive?
Frozen.
Crystallized.
Skipper...
Peters...
...you okay?
Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.
Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan...
Justin.
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
That's what we're here to find out.
Be careful. It's not a load bearing structure...
Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
If it worked, yes.
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
The date.
What about it?
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
I don't know.
Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
You said this ship creates a gateway...
The "Other Place," what is that...?
You can't, your orders are specific...
It's done.
Watch me.
Then who the fuck are you?
Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller?
You know.
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
Better if I just show you.
What is that?
One-four degrees...
Dr. Weir...!
I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
Starck, give me a read.
We have a situation here...
We don't have time to fart.
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
Captain, we got a problem.
Now what?
What is it, Smith?
Come again, Skipper?
No, no, we just got her back together...
Get out of there now!
I just finished drying...
Come around to three-three-four...
Radiation interference?
Keep your eyes open.
We're all here.
But you can breathe it.
Carbon dioxide?
No. It was someone else.
Who?
What is it, Starck?
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
What's going on in there, Starck?
Justin's in the airlock.
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
No. I'll be right back.
...repeat, we're armed...
He served on the Goliath.
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
Can you see a body?
There's no one here.
I did.
Not according to the computer.
Can you shut it down?
Keep him talking.
Do you know what it was?
Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
It's cold.
I don't care.
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
We're losing atmosphere...
All boards are green, everything's five by five.
Range 3000 meters and closing.
Picking up magnetic interference.
Explosive decompression.
Decompression wouldn't do that.
Get them back --
I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
Yes.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
It wants me. I have to go.
The forward airlock.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
Relax, it's casual.
No, I mean... I'm a little... dusty...
I like the sound of that.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.
I mean...
Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
What did he do to the uniform?!
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
Victor must've taken him.
I'm worried about you.
About me? How sweet.
Where do you think? With Sue.
Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
I already got it. Everything I want.
Ben. This is business. Just work.
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
I had it at four.
This makes five.
He's made a few changes.
Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
I should have done more, run more tests --
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Well maybe you should date him.
Ben. Are you okay?
Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
Yeah, nine years straight.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
O-kay. We'll skip that question.
Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
Keep talking, there won't be a next time.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Don't you wander off, boy.
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
Go back to the drawing board.
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
That's terrible news...
So are you!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Stay right. Left is trouble.
I though we went over this.
Last one down springs for room service.
No: You're ON FIRE!
Ben! Ben!
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
I can go hotter!
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
But all these people...
Now.
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
Okay, "mom."
I think that thing is Ben.
Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Dude. That's my sister.
Blockhead started it!
But Johnny... you can't fly.
Showtime.
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
It's been changed.
Yes, thanks.
That's good. That's uh... good.
Passion.
What? What do you mean you --
Sue... look at your hands.
What...?  Oh.
That's what we're here to find out.
If it happened to him, then it could...
I'm sure I can come up with something.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
Of course. Of course.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
I'm sure I can come up with something.
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
Reed, we're running out of time.
Ben did this?
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
I understand the business reasons.
Raising the shields.
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Just find him.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
Oh, I think you already have.
Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
How much did they cost?
Don't worry about it.
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.
It's the first door on your left!
On the ledge?
First door on your left!
There it is!
Later.
This is how I dress all the time.
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton.
Sis.
Hey-yo.
Your friends use the pool too.
I take out the garbage.
Don't strain yourself.
They're not home yet.
I'll explain everything later.
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
Where did you hear that?
I'm just guessing.
Well... it's true.
Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
You are a virgin!
I didn't say that.
But your face did!
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
They were left over from the last shift.
But they weren't mine.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
You're fired.
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Leave me alone.
Dad says!
Nice to meet you.
Mark is a really nice boy...
Sure. Come on in.
I don't know. It's getting pretty late...
Come on...
So are you.  Are you shaking?
No. Are you crazy?
What? Are you all right?
I think we're making a lot of noise.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I guess I did.
I didn't see you this morning.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
All right, I take it back.
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
Seventy-five dollars, and a ride. Okay.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
She's in my biology class.
No.
Did you get her name?
No. It's too soon.
Really?
Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.
Yeah?
Ace the jacket.
Damone. It's Mark.
Mark. What happened to your date?
I'm really pretty busy...
Damone! You come here?
Okay. See ya.
Really.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
You're crazy. Those girls love me.
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
Yes.
Not if you're over sixteen.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
I don't go at all.
I thought he was out of town.
Then don't hassle it.
Suzanne Somers' tits.
All right.
I like sex.
This ain't no cop.
They're fuckin' with us.
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
My brother is gonna shit.
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
Do you think that guy's cute?
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
Should we buy a frame for that?
No way! He just called him a dick.
God. People exaggerate so much at this school.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
What's the big deal?
Well I never did it.
There's nothing to it.
It was okay.
You'll always remember your first time.
It was nice.
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Hey! That's my line!
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Not since November.
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
Does that ever happen?
No. But it's a nice idea.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
What's Doug do in Chicago?
I think they're both virgins.
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
I don't know... I just don't feel right.
It couldn't be.
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
I want romance.
He's not coming.
Not coming? What happened?
Yeah, like maybe never.
But what are you going to do?
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
What class?
That's the name they gave me.
Hey, bud. What's your problem?
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
I couldn't make it in time.
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?
I don't know. I guess so.
All right! Oh, yeah!
Aloha, Spicoli.
How about your phone number?
Where do you feel like going?
I don't know. Wherever you want.
How about the point?
All right, the point it is.
Yes... I am really nineteen.
No. I mean back to your home.
Sure thing.
Yeah. It's my sister's.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Oh yeah.
Two more Cokes.
Do you want to come inside?
Aren't your parents asleep?
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
Do you really have to go?
It's John Bonham's birthday.
John Bonham?
I'll get you the notes.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
Okay. Thanks.
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
Awake? What do you mean?
Not for me.
Righto!
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
Not where we operate.
Naked.
What?
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
He wanted the pineal gland.
Las Vegas.
That's a fine combination. You can't lose.
This is my granddaughter...
No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
Why what?
Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
I have to go.
GO?
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
That's right, laugh about it! You goddamn honkies are all the same!
Whatever's right.
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
Lucy.
I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
...and every one of them stacked naked...
They were all veterans.
No, she's looking for you.
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
Extract of pineal!
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
Yes!
FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
Never missed a plane yet.
Of course, officer.
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
You and a lot of other people.
Don't worry, it's all over now. Thank God for the decent people.
They'll get in! We'll all die!
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
We're going to get my little girl.
Yeah.
Nah, I got the gun.
But it's got teeth.
With what just happened upstairs --
We're lucky to be alive.
C'mon guys--
Upstairs.
Come on, come on.
OPEN THE DOOR!
You gotta be with me on this.
Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.
And the head?
Hey!
Follow me.
In the corner, behind the curtain.
Shit!
No. You?
What?
Why don't you go check it out?
You weren't helpin'.
Go douche.
Who's with me?
He's dead.
My truck.
Yep.
Your parents of relation?
We lived near power lines.
Anyone else?
We gotta try.
Anybody else?
What?
Nothing, this was my last delivery.
Just cover me. It was built to move.
Well...
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
Will I go crazy or something?
Okay then.
I can't feel a thing, Hon.
The girl's got rhythm.
Sure.
How much you got?
How much I got, what?
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
He's dead.
What?
Huh?
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
What?
What do you mean what?
Fully.
Four door?
Covered.
How many?
Holds four.
Seven.
Nine?
Seven.
Sit still, look less like a meal.
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
F-f-fuck you.
You smell like ass!
No bullshit.
What the hell's going on here!?
Clear!
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
Duh hickey.
Gimme the keys.
NO, but I will lock you in.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
No shit.
You keep that key handy.
I'm fine! I'm fine!
If he doesn't shut up...
MOVE YOUR ASS!
HELLLLLLLLP!!
Get something on that.
BONSAI!
Amazing you made it this far.
HELLLPPP!
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
Ok. Let's see what happens.
She's not very nice, is she?
YOU'LL HIT US!
They'll tear this place down within the hour.
Father. The biggest, the strongest...
Whoa!
Not without you!!!
Go!!!
GO-GO-GO!!
That's one piece of four problems.
I'm fine, I really am.
I admire your strength.
We all have to be strong, right?
Oh...
I think --
Are you lying to me?
Well...
I'm not lying.
I said I'm not lying.
I just hit it like you said.
Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
What're you doing?
Putting on my armor.
Who's this?
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
Very fine bone structure.
You see: We've got to change that name.
Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude.
No, I'm concerned with everything.
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act.
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
I'm not!
You're afraid!
I'm not!
What?
Thank you.
Huh.
Frances.
Where's Clifford?
He's not here.
Oh.
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
A rich actress.
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
What does Clifford say?
Right now we have to be practical.
In my eyes, officer.
GET OUT!
You're under arrest.
Sort of.
There've been some calls.
Who?
Without me.
Showdown.
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
I gotta go now.
All square, Doc.
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
Thank you, Harry.
No.
Were you a drug addict?
No. Never.
See you next weekend, Dad.
I didn't have much to do with it.
You wrote it, didn't you?
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
I know.
You really want to go?
Of course.
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
I love you too, Francie.
Daddy!
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
Thank you.
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
See you next weekend?
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.
Oh Angela, my own... Angela!
Fifteen.
Address?
Only if you were in it. Are you?
I wouldn't miss it.
Then don't go to Hollywood.
Why?
No, I don't hate it.
...Not if I can help it.
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
What about your husband?
Why, you... you little bastard!
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
Harry.
You think I'd miss it?
Well? What'd you think?
I just wanted to see how you looked.
Enh.
Don't be a rat, Harry.
Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
Quietly.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
You don't know what you want.
What?
Came to get a tan.
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
Eight stories.
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
I know what ability you're interested in.
Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
Yeah.
Well, the studio told me not to.
Is that why you did it?
Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.
The chauffeur. He's watching.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
I know.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
What's left of my blood.
Help yourself. Everyone else has.
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
I'll bet.
You're coming.
Who said I was a lady?
Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
What?
...Take advantage of me.
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
I guess.
You can't drink.
No. To thoroughbreds.
What's that?
Will you marry me?
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
I know. Don't tell anyone.
I got your number, Mister Man.
Who?
Frances, it's me, Harry?
I love you too, Frances.
Oh Harry...
Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
How did I look?
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
Well... you're looking well.
No, we're not.
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
Just a little way.
And no people.
Yes.
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
What'd you do?
Run!
Who's writing this guy's lines?
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
Did you expect him to look you up?
Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
I live here.
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
The speech? Real good.
You think I got it?
...You will.
Smile, little sister, smile.
Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
You kill me, Mama.
What?
Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?
Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.
Not long.
I'll be back.
At one. Promise?
Sure.
I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
Mama...?
I'm going out!
You're not going anywhere!
No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
Yes...?
I don't believe so.
Thanks are hardly necessary.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
Normal. Average.
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
This whole thing is a joke!
Stay calm, please.
You didn't say 'Symington says'.
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
Good! Because, Brothers, that's you!
'Incurable.'
I was watching.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
You drove him to his torment.
And he drove me to mine.
Then why weep for him?
The music? Or the fire?
Why?
It can't be as bad as that.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
Friends? Do they live around here?
Yes. Very close
Why do you not go to them?
I am afraid.
You speak.
Kill you? Hardly that.
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
There is something I want.  A friend.
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
I'll be waiting. And watching.
Her body pleases me.
A brain. Extremities.
This was not taken from a grave.
What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
I will not! Kill me now!
She's not for you.
SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
There, there... shhh...
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...
And you look so lovely.
It's been months. It's not like him.
I should go. I should leave today.
Fine.
Is he not back yet?
Aren't you?
Nothing can. Not ever.
It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
The world is a dizzying place.
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
Father's so proud.
And you?
I'll have to do better than that.
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
All my life I've known.
Is that what makes it so delicious?
I wish to be your wife.
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
Not as weak as I.
I give you my soul...
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
Elizabeth. My more than sister.
They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
I'm all right. I'm safe,
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
I do. But you must trust me for now.
Now husband and wife.
It wouldn't dare.
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
Oh God.
Very well then.
As a march hare.
Can you think of a better reason?
Quite a few.
It's a letter to my father.
Somebody has to!
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
You can't. Death is God's will!
I resent God's monopoly.
That's blasphemy!
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
I didn't find what I was looking for.
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
What is your name?
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
Victor, explain yourself.
Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe...
The strain was evident.
Are you a physician?
How is it you come to be here?
You know of it?
Your men are right to be afraid.
Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
Madness?
My name is Frankenstein...
I will protect you.
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
Right! Right!
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
You want to leave?
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
Thanks, Alice.
I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
You okay?
Artist.
I don't know.
Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
Not if they're where I think they are.
Well, it hasn't been that long.
Absolutely.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
I'll go take a look.
They're off now.
Okay.
Marcie?
Hey, guys!
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
I meant everything.
I can't, Barry...
Oh, you...
No, they won't...
I need you so much, Claudette.
Where'd you get that stuff?
For sure.
Don't get up. Take a second...
I had to.
Is it stuck?
Get behind him more.
I'll spot you five points.
Coach, athletic director somewhere.
Good call.
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
I love you.
I don't love Neddy.
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
Don't call him.
I call it my shower dream.
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
Mmmmmmmph.
Best over...
Umhummmmph.
There you are dead wrong.
Girls can't be cowboys.
Okay, Fireman.
Those things can be nasty.
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
Aw.
One night on the town.
I mean...
For two lonely nights.
Another coincidence.
Yeah.
Just my son and I.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
Have you ever been there before?
Yeah, follow us.
So let's do it.
Vamanos!
I'm exhausted.
I have no idea.
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that they're back there.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
Jacob.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
What's this about, money?
Come again?
That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.
My wife.
Where is the little lady?
She's dead?
How'd she die?
Auto wreck.
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Yes.
You're a preacher?
I was a minister.
Was? As in not anymore?
Yes.
Why'd ya quit?
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
Didn't like it, did ya?
No, I didn't.
I can handle Richie, don't worry.
Pass.
Why not, against your religion?
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
Suit yourself, more for me.  Scotty?
Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?
To yours.
Forever together.
In other words, no.
Yep.
Kate, Scott?
That happens, you'll get it back.
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
It's a flop house.
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
Scott?
Not good enough, swear to God.
No!
Mexico.
Mexicans.
What did I say?
You asked me if I would --
Do you believe me?
Yes.
You damn well better. Go.
Yeah, we got a bible.
Noooo!
Anytime.
Not many.
Me too.
Later.
-- you got your sink --
-- you got your shower --
-- see this, television!
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
I wasn't scratching!
You callin' him a liar?
You can't come in here.
What dya mean?
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!
He signaled the Ranger.
You believe me don't cha?
Shut up and start the car.
One... Two... Three.
No.
Do they have a waterbed?
-- This conversation is over.
What'd ya see?
Cops.
Didya look at the border?
What?
What the fuck is she doin' there?!
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
It's not your fault, it's her fault!
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
What?
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
What?
No, I didn't.
You meant that, but you meant the other, too.
Or what?
I don't know, you just passed out.
They broke when you fell.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
I'm lookin' scared?
That's what you look like.
You know what you look like?
No, Richie, what do I look like?
You're lookin' green.
Where are you right now?
What do you mean?
Where are you?
I'm here with you.
Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?
Scarred for life, that's how I am!
No problem, lieutenant.
Just some of the women.
The woman I saw you with...
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
But are there... I mean, how many...
Don't say my name.
Who's...  Lieuten --
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
What'd you find, Kathy?
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
Standing right here in my office.
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
I'm fine, sir.
Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.
No, sir, WHAT?
Straight up?
Across the board, sir.
So I'll get a fair shot?
You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?
Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
No problem, sir!
Entering my scan now...
West?
Smoke her.
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
Hey.  Ain't your call, man.
I'll act surprised.
Did you hear?
Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
California.
Yes, dear.
Sounds familiar.
You'll think about my offer?
'Snot me.  It's him.
... two... one... MARK!
Sir?
Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
I'll try anyway, sir.
Not due in for 22 minutes, sir. Watcha got?
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Probably hear back from CNN first.
This has nothing to do with you.
Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
I saw an article...
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
Sure.  I'll join the crowd.
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
What about him.
What?
Yeah.  Me too.
Well, now I feel so much better.
Made it to Week 10 last time.
Thanks, Wick.
Wick.  They got your crew, too?
At first.
You got anybody, Wick?
Not me.  You?
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
I think you look beautiful.
Sure, sure.
Just askin'
I don't know...
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
Smoke it!
You heard me.  Move on.
Educate her, Pyro.
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
Any brothers?  Sisters?
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
Wasn't deemed a threat.
You think we should go easy on women, O'Neil?
No.
I'm so glad we agree.
Okay, O'Neil.  So you've impressed all the others.  Now try me.
15, sir.
Show us where you are, Chief.
Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
North?
Shut your hole, Slutnik.
Darth Vader reads poetry...
We are so fucked.
Somebody throw a tent over this circus.
So am I.
What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
O'Neil, Jordan.
Thought you two were file-closed.
You knew about us?
Sorry.  Thought you knew I knew.
Hmm.  Let's aim higher.
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
Great. See ya then.
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
Go in there. Talk to her.
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
Well, I can be tough if I want.
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
We know, Audrey.
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
Only one way to find out.
Oh yes he will.
But we can get to the west side faster.
You must have quite some harem.
What?
I'm sorry you feel that way.
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
What else do you know about it?
Are you sure?
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
You never said it was off the record.
Our network covers the Ranger games.
Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
Really? I'd like to find out.
Oh, just some insurance guy.
He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
Nick Tatopoulos.
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
Can I use some?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
You're kidding, right?
This is not the place...
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
And you're beautiful...
Mr. Caiman...
Call me Charlie.
It's your choice.
Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
Really? A girlfriend then?
No. Perhaps I work too much.
Well, I think you're cute.
Oh, thank you.  Is she always like this?
Me too.
Allez, allez!
That is when we will go in.
Where's Luc and Pierre?
They didn't make it.
And how should we do that, Sir?
That is our job.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Get your people out of there or I will.
It's Tatopoulos.
You're standing on it.
It may be too late by then. These eggs will hatch very quickly.
That thing's dead. What the hell are we waiting for?
Thanks.
We've met before.
Oh yeah, the insurance guy.
Oh.
I need you to trust me.
Why do you need that?
We, have already taken care of them.
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
Makes us look more American.
Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
It's okay. I know her.
It's Raymond.
Where are you?
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
Where's my bed?
Right... Sorry, sir.
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
Open.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
I won't and nothing you say-
"The show must go on."
...Damn you!  Damn you!
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
Must be some sort of mining facility.
You go first! There's no time!
Nothing.
I heard something. A squeal.
KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!...
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
Yes. Good was done this .....
I played Richard III...
They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
The engines are dead. We're drifting.
Hey, watch that "Laredo" shit.
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
Oh can't I? Watch me!
Why didn't you stop at the market?
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
You could order something in.
A boy comes to the door.
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
All this from watching the.. historical records?
Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
The ships are gaining...
Alex? Where are you going?
To see if there's a pub.
Nobody was WATCHING?
What?
Yes you did.
By Grabthar's Hammer, this is true. 159	NT. LIVING ROOM - SOMEWHERE - NIGHT	159
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
What's  your name, son?
Brandon.
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
What does the Omega 13 do?
Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
What do you mean?
Wait two seconds then go.
Lt. Madison, GO.
Shit! Go!
GO Commander.
What?  Up?
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
We're getting major structural damage.
There is no weather in space.
Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
The enemy is matching velocity.
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
All systems are working, Commander.
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
Never mind, Fred....
No, no... I'll think on it...
Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
You... know us?
It's ... incredible.
Something BAD happened here.
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
Yeah, what is it?
It's... I don't know.
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
No. Keep all energy to the armor.
Hey, YOU want to drive?
We're doing episode 31?
Where'd they go? Back inside?
I think he just likes pointing at things.
What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander.
You smiled at me.
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-
Only answers to me.
But I'm the Commander!
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
Let me think. I need time to think.
I don't think that's a cloud...
Computer, can it be repaired?
Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
It helps.
Will you stop RIDING ME?!
Yes. Yes, I'm here!
Nothing. Hold please.
What the hell are you talking about?
Wait... Jason, Here!...
Mark 12.
This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.
Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
Almost as much as he loves himself.
Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
Wait, Fred, what about your thing, you know... "Digitize me, Sergeant Chen!"
Stop, please! I don't know!
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
Simpler.
We.. We lie.
Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
Catch me later, okay?
Home.
You... You mean Earth?
But what if Sarris survives?
Thanks
It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
... Maintenance facility...
NO, Thank God he has not.
Then how did he find out about the device?
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
Former Commander?
You what?.. What are you talking about?
Well... Sort of...
A model, only as big as this.
But... Inside, I have seen-
It's as far as it goes!
Push It. Hold it down.
Oh god...
Anything.
Tommy, we have these...
Okay, let's go.
Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
How about the pig-lizard?
Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.
It doesn't have eyes.
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
Pedal to the metal...
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Mark 20 Into the black hole,  areao.
Patience, Lt. . Patience.
Because they're coming right at us.
Fire at will. hI~D  NT. PROTECTOR
They always say that.
I wish she was beneath me.
You seem pleased by the prospect.
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
It is.
The army can survive without me.
I?  You all know my history.
Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
That you would have known you can trust me.
Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
Yes, general?
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
I'll be twenty next year, sir.
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
We better, Congress invented him.
George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.
Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.
I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief.
Gag on your own invention, then.
Oh, come now...
You invented this, this...
These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
Detained by what?
The British army, sir!
We already have black soldiers in our army...
What's the difference?
What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.
George!  So good to be back!
They help me understand why we fight.
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
The one with 'Philadelphia' spelled correctly is the counterfeit.
These supplies...?
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
And how rusty are these muskets?
General Lee, sir!
Get these men back in line!
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
I don't want to see your hospital.
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
It is; we need you George.
Is that the truth?  Well, we can't carry on like animals any longer.
But not more than your comfort.
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
"Mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in chains..."
Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?
Africa, of course.
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
Let's get you darker!
You're out of your mind!
Voltaire, of course...
Just because they are born?
Yes!
Who says so?
I say!
I see...
Though, sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season.
He was not black!  He was... tan! Weathered!
Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
I reserved a Cadillac.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
You're kidding me, right?
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
You see that? The way the man just went right over?
Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.
I guess still in the locker.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
I mean I don't care.
Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
No. What's this?
Plan B. Here ya go, honey...
The money. Fuck. I gotta think...
Calm down, Bear...
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
You serious? This is how you guys do business? I can't believe you aren't dead.
So... how many movies you been in?
No shit? What're some of 'em?
Your who?
Yayo. Where is he?
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
Harry, let me answer that.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
What about her?
Get something going there.
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.
What money?
In just a second. Two...
Three.
She can't talk right now.
I'll find it.
In the can. That the money?
Bear, you're not really gonna -
You positive about that?
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?
Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
That's the magic number.
What I been wondering is where's he been.
Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately.
Who is this?
Okay. So who are you?
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Look at me, Ray.
You say look at you?
That's correct. Look at me.
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
Sovereign.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
Get in line, bro.
I don't like waiting.
Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
That's right.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
I'm in the movie business.
You're an investor, is that it?
I'm a producer.
You have a card in here?
Not yet. I just started.
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
Harry, lemme give you some advice.
I know what a marker is.
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
I'm not the guy, Harry.
But you work for the casino?
Not really.
What does that mean?
Maybe a few times I have.
Ever shot anybody.
Once.
Really? You ever been arrested?
"Mr. Lovejoy".
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
Just a thought.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
What do you get out of this?
Let's see how we get along.
Never say anything unless you have to.
Get the fuck outta my chair.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Personally?
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
I'm thinking of a movie.
One of mine?
With what? Wiseguy money?
Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.
I'm looking at you.
Now you're squinting like you need glasses.
That's not bad.
You're not going to tell me the rest?
Compass.
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
I'm up twelve grand today.
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
Who told you that?
Here's another tip...
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
Sit down, Leo.
At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
You broke in?
What're you doing here?
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
I just caught the end.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
Not yet.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
What happened?
Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
Are you going down?
I don't know.
You're as bad as Harry...
Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...
You bet.
Go get your stuff.
Couldn't find my toothbrush.
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
That's what the guy said.
Don't say a fuckin' word.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Whatta you doing out there?
I'm going into the movie business.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
Pick 'n' Save.
Hm?
You seem to feel fine about it.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
I don't hear anything.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
I'm going.
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
No problem. You go on off to bed.
'We?'
Chili and me.
Hello, Martin.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
But you are interested?
A passenger liner. Over.
Say again. Over.
Roger, North Island. Arctic Warrior over and out.
I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
With that coxswain dickhead.
Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
Sixty pounds.
That's what it says.
Lemme see.
Morning, skipper.
I don't know. Tuesday?
Wrong. It's Friday.
After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather.
Why not.
What?
What?
Maureen.
Maureen?
Roger?
Yeah.
No.
Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions?
Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
What're you crazy?
I like my job.
Gimme a break.
Maybe he isn't alone.
Oh yeah.
Right. Wednesday.
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
What?
Yeah, yeah.
Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
What is it?
Threw a turbine blade.
Turbine rotor's shot.
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
How much longer's that gonna take?
Like I always say --
The right way and the wrong way.
But how long?
Hard to say.
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
Three, four days.
Goddamit, Dodge.
She take a radio?
What, you think there's something funny about it?
It looks like it.
Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.
Could be meant as a warning.
So whoever did this might still be around.
Murphy.
If they knew what they were carrying.
I don't know what you're talking about?
I think you know.
Maybe you can tell me then.
The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
What?!
If money can buy what he wants.
Sorry.
Don't fall asleep.
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Too big. More like a freighter.
He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
Hell yeah.
Because of the gold.
Headache, nausea, lights?
Sudden flashes of light.
I feel fine.
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
It's my pen name.
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
Yeah. Thanks.
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
Did you see him?
Who?
What? What the hell're you talking about.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
You sure it wasn't me?
We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
No cowboy shit. Right.
Yup.
Epps.
You just shoot at something?
Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
Same. Any luck?
No. I'll try again later.
What?
But, who -- ?
But where's the damage?
If it was a ship she hit.
Doesn't matter.
Hey.
Couldn't sleep.
Wish I could say the same.
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
I don't know, are we?
What happened.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
That much I think we've already established.
I don't know.
Epps, over.
Either of you seen Dodge?
Right here.
Maybe it was more than that.
We hit land.
What?
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
I think I see it pretty well.
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
What do you say, Dodge?
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
I must be in the wrong business.
You got that right.
Better than "making hamburger for Mickey D."
Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.
Looks like it's adrift.
How's that?
Sorry.
You're up late.
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
And get a bunch of fools sniffin' around here?
Moving to Sweden.
Supposing he wants to get bad with us?
Drink up then.
Lost my sea legs.
You don't remember?
I wish I could tell you. I'd be real interested to know myself.
Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
A what?
The mooring hasn't come taught.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
Doesn't look like it much matters.
Leave it.
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
I heard you. But I'm choosing to ignore you. Epps, let's go.
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
What's this?
No, no. You got leak.
Fifteen, at the most.
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula.
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Guess.
How should I know?
Who?
Give up?
YES.
Maxine.
Not the Maxine?
God, how horrifying.
I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow.
What is it now?
Are you still looking for a job?
Nothing.
Are you going to yell at me?
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
I see... interesting...
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
So what do you think?
I...
What do you mean?
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
I didn't check my messages...
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
It's not optional!
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --
It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.
Oh my God, that's HIM!
Hi.
Yeah, well... hi...
Can I come in?
What do you mean "why"?
When did I say I hated you?
Yeah, well --
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
Okay... I promise.
Hey Josh.
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
Uh oh... don't turn around...
What? Why?
Forget it...
I know, she needs to die immediately.
Just look at them!
We should follow them!
In fact, never.
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
That lets us off the hook.
Hey, look at this...
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
What does that even mean?
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
I've been looking all over for this.
What a little hosebag.
I remember every minute of that party.
There's my dad with Joanie.
You know, the green cardigan guy.
Oh yeah.
You're better at it.
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
It's still twenty-five minutes early.
I'm going to tell him you said that.
She says she wants to MMPH!
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
I can't believe it!
Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
Totally! Look!
We should follow him home.
I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start feeling really bad again.
Come on, it's too late now...
Gross!
Ew, it's like some gross rat...
Forget it, I can't explain it...
What, is she black now?
Let's go hassle Josh.
"Hassle"?
As always.
JOSH!
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Should we leave a note?
It'll only take a second.
Everybody's too stupid!
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet?
It's a surprise.
I don't believe you.
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
Where did you get that?
You won't believe it! Guess!
Where?
Anthony's II!
No way... when?
Just now... I went with Seymour.
You cunt!
God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
Which one?
He gives me a total boner!
He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
Get away from me!
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
Yeah, I guess... call me...
No, really...
God, you're really obsessed...
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
What happened to Seymour?
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
So should I come over?
What are you talking about? Who?
Just some people from work...
I don't believe you.
What? When did you see Josh?!
He came into work.
Why? What did he say?
Nothing.
When was this?
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life!
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off.
So where's all your stuff?
That's all you're bringing?
I dunno...
Maybe an orange juice.
It just came yesterday...
Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!
Just because.
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
See, that's exactly the kind of thing we're trying to avoid. 
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
Well, bye you guys... CONGRATULATIONS!
What are you doing here, Melorra?
I love this place... it's so - you know, "funky."
Who does?
I thought it wasn't for sale.
It's kind of falling apart.
Where did you get those pants?
Punk rock is over!
I know it's over, asshole, I --
That tape sucked, by the way!
Get a job!
Norman.
Fine, and how are you?
Did you bring that tape?
Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
Later, "Dude".
What?
Five hundred.
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Well why do I care about that?
Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...
A dollar seventy-five.
Okay.
Watch my stuff.
NO!!!
PLEASE? We have to!
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Fine, I'll go by myself then...
OH MY GOD!
These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
For nineteen years...
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
What? Why?
Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
Are you okay?
Never...
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
Hi, it's me...
Oh, hi...
So, what happened?
YAAA!
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
And you like them?
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
Does that mean you don't like me?
No, of course not.
So, do you like me, Seymour?
In what way do you mean?
In whatever way you think I mean.
I had to see you.
What's up?
Uh... sure... come in.
Do you have anything to drink?
I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
What do you want?
I-I-I...
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
I will if you want to.
No... forget it...
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh?
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
I wish I could see him.
Call me sometime.
Talk to us about it...
It's a tampon in a teacup...
Right, exactly!
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
I don't know... where is she, then?
Maybe she's with Josh?
I don't know.
Why? What did she tell you?
I have no idea - I just want to...
Did she say that?
On that pathetic fake blind date.
What are you talking about?
What fake blind date? What are you talking about?
Yes?
Let me see the sick.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
There is no reason for fear.
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
As are they all.
-now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so-
Am I to take it you want to live?
How; we don't know where they are?
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
Don't they, though?
So work must be going well?
Well, I need to speak to him.
-not a time for modesty, Bob-
You don't enjoy killing, do you? 
Then why do it?
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
You intend "sorting this out" tonight?
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
We have hunted since childhood.
Might be exciting for you.
Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced.  Why not, indeed! 
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent. 
Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands- 
That's what the books say... 
You mean nobody died?
What did I do?
Got me out of trouble.
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
Samuel says you killed a lion.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
Has it ever done that before?
...don't know...
Have you ever failed?
Only in life... 
I got big. 
You think they'll come then?  Why?
Good luck.
Why?
The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
This is more difficult-
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
Thank you, Samuel.
Good news?
Do you love her?
I do, actually; very much.
You give me hope, John. 
Oh yes. But it takes time.
You've known him long?
Since his beard was red.
Once... 
Underneath.  Somewhere.
I don't believe you had a mother. 
Four should do it.
They will want a lot of money.
Not even close.  What happened?
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
Hold your son high. 
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
Do you ever see him?
Occasionally
How is he these days?
No.  Not that I can recall.
Thank you.
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
You're also a human being, Frank.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
Okay, that's no problem.
That's exactly what you said last week.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
Oscar!  You poor kid!
I'll supervise.
Okay, let's take a look.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
Thanks.
Oh, hello, Peter.
You're really good, you know.
I don't know what to do anymore.
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
Finally came to your senses, huh?
Same difference.
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
You're right.  We should stay.
How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
-- the sorrow --
I command you.
I await the word of Vigo.
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
Who are they?
You've got to stop them.  Please!
Get on with it, counselor!
Did I forget something?
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
You were the one who got me in.
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
Hello, Venkman.
I don't even want to know where that is.
Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard.
I knew that.
You need the exercise.
This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
Ostrov?  I've been there.  Good party town.
Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
His nickname is "The Hammer."
And we're the ...
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
Nine feet -- ten --
Do it!  Just do it!
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
No, the slime is rising.
And it's all flowing toward the museum.
There's something very familiar about this painting.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Oh, Ray --
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
Who, Ray?
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
I'm Peter --
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
I hate Jello.
Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
She's new in town.
Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
I'm ready.
Then let's do it.
Huh?  What?
You finished here?
What?  Yeah.
Well don't think!
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
And decent.
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Have I done the right thing?
What's the matter, dear?
Ummm -- figure eight?
Well, you're doing great.  Keep it up.
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.
Hi, Louis.
Are you sick, Louis?
Hi, Louis.
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
I got the Twister game for later ...
I am Zuul.
Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
It's in the stars.
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
That's a violin concerto.
Yeah, but it's got a great cello break.
No?  What do I act like?
Like a used car salesman.
Thanks.  What's in there?
What?
Nothing.  Is that the kitchen?
Well, let's check it out.
I'll wait here if you don't mind.
I told you, I ...
I know.  It happened by itself.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah.
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
I think I should spend the night here.
On a purely scientific basis.
Out!
I want to help you.
Don't scream.
Then leave.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
Goodbye.
You heard it?
You're the best one in your row.
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
I want you inside me.
Whoa!! Nice voice.
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
We'll get back to you.
I think it's the food of the future.
Remind me not to go to lunch with you.
In the physical sense.
What is it?
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
You could say that.
And may I see this storage facility?
No, you may not.
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
Because you didn't say the magic word.
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
The magic word is "please."
Why do you want to see it?
Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
A square?
Good guess -- but no.
Yes.  I don't like this.
Sorry.  This isn't your day.
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
Then my theory was correct.
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
What on earth gave you that idea?
What have you got, Egon?
Wow!
Don't cross the beams.
Trust me.  It will be bad.
What do you mean "bad?"
What is it?
Oh, shit!
Gozer.
You talked to Gozer?
No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
But it's my favorite state.
We'd better adjust our streams.
Neutronize.  System shut.
Looked at with your eyes.
What do we do now?
I don't know.  Talk to it.
What do I say?
Anything!  Just make contact.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
No sense worrying about it now.
Where are you, Pete?
Third floor.  Get down here,
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild.
How do you know?
I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
I don't think it's Shandor.
Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
What?  What popped in there?
Look!
Mmmhmmm.
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
Judgement Day ...
Yeah, Judgement Day.
LATER, MAN!!
What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.
That's what you told me two days ago!
I'm tired of being stuck in that wagon.
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
For the gods, spit it out!
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
You're coming back?
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
But I get what I want, always, don't I?
Not yet, dear brother...
Send them out!
Perhaps, Master Galen, you may say.
Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political.  Not a Republican by any chance?
Apparently my opinion wasn't needed.
And my army would have thrown your body into the Danube.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
I'm serious.
So am I.
I wouldn't know who to bet on.
He left us at dawn.
Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
Jerses -- tomorrow...
But have never been?
We all know what right is, Senator.
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
You don't know how wrong you are.
My loyalties... were in doubt.
They can't... if this is Rome...
Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.
But you do exist.  Narcissus:  hero of the battle of the Danube.
Would that Marcus had lived.
He killed his father and then my family...
Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive.  All of them.
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
They fear me.
As soon as I can.
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
On my honor as your daddy...
Well, they die for it!
I was summoned.
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
Athenians...
They're studying with Cynics.
Of course...
I can see that...
Quintus is overly idealistic.
What you don't want to imagine is the things I've done.
Chain him.
-- to fight?  We'll see...
You get to come alive again in the country!
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
Then get a large cash advance.
Something else, then.  Do the chariot races interest you?
Hello.
I'd love some.
No.
Why not?
No -- why should I?
I don't know.
No.
I'm sorry I took you in there.
I think I'd better go home now please.
I just want to tell you something.
But could I just tell you this one thing?
No, I couldn't.
But could you try?
No.
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
Wait a minute.
Is anything wrong?
Of course not.
Yes.
Yes.
With a family?
And it's all over now.
Yes.
I'm glad.
You do?
Benjamin -- I really do.
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
Because I want to know what's happening.
That woman --
What?
That woman. The older woman.
You mean the one who --
Oh my God --
GET OUT!
Don't cry. 
Get out of here.
Ah. Where?
At the Zoo.
No.
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Yes.
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
Here he comes.
What?
Is it because I'm here?
I think it is.
All right then! Yes!
Well, I want you to leave.
Elaine -- I love you.
How could you do that, Benjamin?
Did you say rape her?
Because it isn't true.
I don't feel well.
Elaine -- that is not what happened.
My belt.
Don't you have it on?
I don't know.
No.
Well -- where are you going?
I don't understand.
Goodbye.
What?
But you might.
I might.
When?
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
You mean you're confused?
I don't see how we can.
We just can.
I have to go back now.
I'll think about it.
You really will?
Yes.
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Why wouldn't it?
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Shhhh.
No.
The day after tomorrow?
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
What?
Hello -- who is this?
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Is the doctor anywhere?
I certainly hope you --
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
Ben.
Mr. McQuire.
Are you listening?
Yes I am.
Plastics.
Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.
Not exactly.
I said -- not exactly -- no.
What are you then?
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
One of those outside agitators.
Oh -- no sir.
Who screamed?
It was just a visitor. But it's all right now.
You heard me. Out of here.
What for?
Because I don't like you.
Could I make one phone call first?
Yes.
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
I'm in the bathroom.
Well here's the purse.
Could you bring it up?
Well I'll hand it to you.
Will you bring it in to me?
I'd rather not.
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
Did you get a room?
What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
The Singleman party, sir?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
It's in the main ballroom.
Ahh -- thank you.
A single room or a double room?
A single. Just for myself, please.
Will you sign the register, please?
What? No. Nothing.
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Where is it?
What?
Where is your luggage?
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
Is what a girl?
Whatever it is you're upset about.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
That's right.
Will you take me home?
What?
No. 
Let's go.
Right.
What?
What do you drink?
When is he coming back?
I don't know.
No.
What do you mean?
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Did you know that?
Look -- I think I should be going --
Sit down, Benjamin.
What?
What's wrong?
What do you think?
Well I don't know.
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
What is wrong with me?
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
Her portrait?
Yes.
No.
Yes?
Will you unzip my dress?
Oh. Well, goodnight.
Won't you unzip my dress?
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
I know that. But I'm --
Come on.
Right.
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Then why do you keep running away?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Don't you think he trusts us together?
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
On that chair in the hall.
Get away from that door.
Jesus Christ!
Do you understand what I said?
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
Because I find you very attractive and any time --
I've got to go.
Yes.
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Very well. Thank you.
A drink? Of course.
Waiter!
I haven't. No.
Do you want to?
Do you want to get it now?
Yes.
Why don't you get it.
Yes -- I think that would be good.
I'll be up in five minutes.
Well -- goodbye then --
Benjamin.
Yes?
Yes.
What?
Benjamin.
Yes?
Oh -- sure. Thank you.
A hanger.
What?
Either one will be fine.
Okay.
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
You what?
This is all terribly wrong.
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
Is this -- what?
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
Wait a minute!
Who said it was my first time?
That you're afraid --
Wait a minute.
Anything. Anything at all.
Well?
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Don't you?
You're not interested in art?
No.
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
Yes I do.
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
What?
What novel did you read.
I don't remember.
What?
You walk right out the door.
He's asleep.
Always?
What?
Calm down, Benjamin.
Now let's keep going here.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
Thank you.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
Is it?
But you don't hate him.
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
Well how do you feel about him, then?
What?
Well, wait a minute. You married him.
See if you can guess.
Well I can't.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
At college.
Yes.
What was your major?
Why are you asking me all this?
Art?
Well how did it happen?
How do you think.
We'd go to his car.
Oh no. In the car you did it?
I don't think we were the first.
Really. I want to know.
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
Don't talk about Elaine?
No.
Why not?
Because I don't want you to.
There's nothing to tell.
I was just kidding around.
Good.
But why shouldn't I?
I have my reasons.
Then let's hear them.
No.
Well, I'm not.
You're not.
You're goddamn right I am.
Now don't start this.
What?
Don't start acting hurt.
Of course you did.
Of course I wouldn't.
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
But it's not.
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Thank you.
This is absurd.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
Then you'd better start believing me.
Where is Elaine?
I don't think so.
Sir?
Very good, sir.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
Goodnight, sir.
Yes, but I'm afraid --
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
No, I do. I want to tell you.
What else?
Nothing else.
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
I do.
You believe me, don't you?
No.
You don't?
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
No -- they don't.
Well -- when did you decide all this?
Well --
About what?
I guess -- about my future.
What about it?
Different.
Have you thought about graduate school?
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
No. She doesn't know about it.
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
What?
I've got to go.
Ben -- how old are you now?
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
You'll never be young again.
I know.
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Yes, sir.
Great.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
Why?
That's quite a statement.
Don't shout at me, Ben.
Mrs. Robinson?
Yes?
It's Benjamin.
Yes?
Benjamin Braddock.
Benjamin -- where are you?
Can you look through the glass.
Yes, I can.
Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
They are?  Come on.
It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
Yes, sir.
The pearls are in her room.
Why?
No -- no -- no -- no...
Why?
No --
With the pearls --
You can't.
I'll pay you back.
How?
Not with strangers.
You're a fool!
Yes, I am rather.
Who?
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Have you seen it?
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
You?
Oh -- work!!
Oh!
Dictation.  You know...
No -- why? -- should I?
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Too bad.
What?
Free --
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
You're very funny --
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Of course.
Really?
All right. We'll dance.
Sorry.
Chasing what?
Money.
Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
Will you do me a big favor?
I'll do anything for you.
Would you like to make a man happy?
Yes -- I'd love to.
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
I feel sorry for him.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
Yes --
You live here?
For tonight. 
Yes -- oh!
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
Nothing -- only to be here.
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Because you love me -- you love me?
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
How tired you are!
Yes -- tired...
So alone.
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
Strange man...
Am I quite strange to you?
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
You are beautiful!
No.
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
That's a silly joke.
Oh -- 
I'll not denounce you.
So --
Yes -- yes -- yes.
Yes.
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
I'll go -- good-bye.
Shall I see you again?
I --
When are you leaving Berlin?
For Vienna?
Why later?
I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.
No?
Why?
Don't.
On the train?
Bless you --
Not at all, sir. 
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
Oh, a Baron! 
Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
Where the music's playing and the ladies are...
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
A little strange, Baron.
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
If I could get into a game I might win some.
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
We could come to my room.
Ready, Baron.
No -- not at all.
All right then.
All right then.
You've lost everything?
I've no luck.
Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again... 
All of that at once, Baron?
Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
How's the beautiful lady?
I thought she was splendid!
Yes -- but the audience.
Yes, I was in the war.
Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
I did not ask your advice.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
I must have made a mistake.
Don't do that. 
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
If a young woman, a stenographer, -- etc.
Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
Good heavens. What for?
I don't know.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
No, Doctor.
Telegrams?
No, Doctor.
Nobody, Doctor.
No, doctor.
Oh -- but -- I --
You're tired. I can see that.
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
Stay where you are.
No.
I'm engaged for the evening.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --  Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five o'clock. 
Yes -- that --
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
A man might what?
I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
She's beautiful -- isn't she?
You're trembling.
I never danced before -- in public.
You dance splendidly.
Really?
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
Yes, of course, -- money!
You don't understand that do you?
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.
I'm the stenographer.
Then you will please wait outside.
Moreover --
Moreover...
No -- only occasional jobs. 
Tired?
You pay me.
You're a very unusual stenographer --
Moreover...
Moreover... 
I got ten marks for that.
Me.
Moreover...
What?
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
What brown hands you have.
Skiing? 
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
What?
You're a little too fast.
Can't you understand me?
I understand you perfectly.
Have you got it now?
Cotton Company --
...weight into the balance...
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Definitely off.
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. 
Hello!
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
It's urgent.
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
No -- now.
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
Nothing.
Yes.
Well?
A thousand marks -- 
Insolent young cub!
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Baron!
Well, he's a gentleman!
I had to arrange about the trip.
You think so?
Here, hold up!
Why not?
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know.
I mean with the Manchester people?
No water -- What a place!
All you have to do is phone for it.
Of course you took the initiative.
And I said we didn't.
You've decided against the merger?
Yes --
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
Under these circumstances we might refuse to sign.
We did not approach you.
You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
What a session this has been.
He likes to play the great man.
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
You see -- what we are interested in --
Ah, come on -- we're going home.
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
Let us cancel the engagement.
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Send it away -- I shan't need it.
All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
Good morning, Madam.
Oh, yes, Suzette.
Madam will dress now, it is late.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
Yes, madam Suzette knows all about it.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov? 
Oh!
Take them back, Suzette.
You haven't time.
Such nonsense.
I wish to be alone.
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
I know -- I know -- but it will be sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest then.
The performance -- the performance -- the performance. 
What -- what is it? Last night...
Last night?... There was no applause.
There was -- there was.
Good morning, Gru -- your --
Yes, Pimenov.  One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
Again?
Please.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
What is this insolence?
Me?
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
Yes, the police must be called.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
I know -- I know.
That.
Pretty as a picture.
You wanna talk to me straight up?
Your what?
My son was in the hospital --
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
You expect me to buy this?
You mean, the insurance frammis?
Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
You want a drink?
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
Roy? He's always crying.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Oh, everything's the same size, same price.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Right in front of the room.
No problem. My husband gets up the crack of dawn.  It's his kidneys.
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
Henry, no!
Can't move.
Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?
I can keep my mouth shut, Mister Fellowes.
These machines -- They're in here.
Why? What's wrong?
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
I'll get you a check.
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
Hello.
No?
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
Perk, remember?
Only one arm?
Don't mention it.
You always did.
And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
Get off the grift, Roy.
Why?
Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.
We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
Roy, I don't want money from you.
I pay my debts.
You do?
No. That was the point.
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
You, too, Roy.
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
That's pretty funny, all right. What happened in Phoenix?
Just a few bucks.
And Myra's stuff?
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
I'll get it.
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
That's right.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
We'll work something out, Joe.
You taught me a lot. Then I invented.
I can't. I just left home.
You're too young. You should be in school.
I am in school.
In your other hand.
Always, for you, baby.
Taking you for granite?
Look at me.
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
Roy? It this all we have?
All? It ain't bad.
No more than this?
I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
Oh, yeah?  Thanks.  How long do they say I'm in here?
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
Every day in every way.
I'll see you when you get home.
You ain't seen nothin.
See you soon.
Oh, come on, Roy.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
Myra, I'm not following this.
The long end. Big con.
Nobody does that single-o.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
He retired.
Where?
Upstate.
Atascadero.
Sure.
What?  What for?
Open it and find out.
I went out to Delmar.
I saw her.
She didn't see you, in other words.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out.
But the setup's there. It's there now.
I don't think I need it.
No! Because I --
That's what I say.
What?
For Christ's sake, why not?
I'm happy the way I am.
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
That's natural.
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
You up to it now?
Sure. Let's get it over.
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
No question, huh?
No, its -- Why did she--?
Oh, yeah. That's that.
Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
That's true, Mr. Simms.
I like a woman who takes control.
That don't match either of the victim's.
Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
Only the real stiffs.
I can be real stiff.
Charming.
Care to join me?
Sweet dreams, Blake.
The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
Do I know you?
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
Carter.
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there.
It's Amy Kramer.
My god...
What the fuck are you talking about?
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
Would somebody shut this guy up?
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
I think someone broke into my house.
No shit.
Checking out your place.
No.  Wait for the police.
Betcha' didn't predict that.
I know.
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Just forget it...
I was trying to get away from someone.
Why didn't you tell me?
I was trying to protect you from this...
I don't know.
Get on the bus.
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Just get on the bus.
I'm not leaving without her.
John...
Please, get on the bus...
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
You stole it?
I borrowed it.
Why not?
I can't afford to get caught.
I came to see you.
Can I come in?
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
Then you come out here.
Then I'll get caught.
Alright.  I'll come out.  Just be quiet.
Here, take my jacket.
Yeah.
Who?!
Michael Meyers!
Looks great.  It does.
You okay?  You seem a little off.
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
It's always John.
Still wants to move out?
This kid just wants his freedom.
It's not going to happen.
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
What?
What are you looking at?
I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
Michael Meyers.
The serial killer?
He's my brother.
I can't believe this is happening.
Shit happens.
I'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms...
You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
What is it?
I have to pee.
Can't you?
I did alright.
You're unbelievable.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
Shit, Linda!
You're so easy...
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
Where's Shane?
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Have enough fun for the both of us.
Oh, don't be such a victim.
Pig.  What the hell happened this time?
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
He's in the bathroom.
Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
We can light our own tree at home.
Then they can watch.
Answer what?
What if it's Kara?
The voice man!  He's here!
He says things.  Bad things.
Like what?
Okay ... But just for tonight.
You can't expect us to stay here --
No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
I promise.
Danny!!!
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
You knew, didn't you, John?  You knew.
I've come to help your family.
Found this morning.  In a field outside Haddonfield.  Stabbed.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
You stay away from him!
Here.  Let me try.
Not just Kyle.  All of you.  His entire family.  Here.  Look at this.
He's gone.
Kara, no!
Wait a minute ...
It's not working!
You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to.
An old friend.
Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
I'll meet you over there.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Why did you take Jamie?
Stay away, Sam.
Leave the boy.  Take me.
Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael Myers come home?
Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.
No!!!
I dunno, boy.
Hm?
A bitch.
Didn't recognize you.
We've never met.
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
Home is important to a man.
You know what gets me?
Must have changed that law.
You know what gets me?
Oh, shit.
At least we found the diamonds.
At least!
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
Go home!
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
I'm liable to find anything!
You know what gets me?
Let's talk about it some other time.
How short the skirts are.
Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
Go home!
You ever own a motorcycle?
Let's talk about something else.
I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
First Nagasaki--now this.
How about breakfast, wife?
The educational process.
She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
You know me, boy.
You told me.
When?
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
You never played a violin.
You did?
You.
You're an imbecile.
I know you think that.
Everybody thinks that.
I don't think so.  It could have been.
How are you, honeybunch?
Is Penelope in?
The posies are for her?
I wanted to apologize.
You've come to the right man.
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
I forget mine for years on end.
Oh my God--  And you are Looseleaf Harper.
You actually sold insurance!
Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.
I just want one true adventure before I die.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
Things.  Oh--you silly people and your things.  Things, things, things.
For what?
For Africa.
What went wrong?
You're hollow, like a woman.
I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
Out!  Out!
As a matter of fact--
Sir?
Hello.
Are you--
Are you--do you--
Ask it!
Life has denied me that thrill.
Do you mind if I ask who you are?
Is anybody besides you here now?
Everybody says he was so brave.
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
He worships Father.
He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
College!
What's good about that?
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
Tell me some true stories about Dad.
Oh hell.
Dad was never in England?
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
Mhravitch.
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
No, no, no, no, no.
Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
Why don't you go to bed--son.
I can't take my eyes off you.
The smallest thing I've got.
Can I get dressed first?
Make it fast.
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
Leave a tip.
Who was it?
What's this?
Nothing.
That's a rifle you have?
No.
Open the bolt!
I don't want to fight you.
Yeah.  But it's going to get loud again.
Heaven.
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
Eighteen--  and a half.
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
Daughter--I love you very much.
You don't even know me.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
This is crazy.
What do you do for a living?
Give us time.
Like hugging a lamp post.
Situation.
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
We thought a doctor might help.
Your old beau?
We thought it was an emergency.
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
We all are.
Shouldn't you lie down?
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
I was, I was.  It never lasts long.
Thank God!
Say hello to your mother.
Do say hello to your mother.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
It's so--so stark.
You used to like it stark!
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
Turn around?
Ram it up your ass!
People don't use that word any more.
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
They don't have to feel like slaves.
Then go now--and fry with dignity-- sunnyside up.
What then?
Yes.
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
And he keeps it in his apartment?
And no one's there now?
I don't think so.
Why not?
Sneaking in the back door.
If he wants to go.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
Almost a Christmas scene.
Just one favor.
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
You're begging him to kill you?
If he thinks he's man enough.
What a handsome word.
No.
Ah!  The lady is armed.
There it is.  Give it to me.
Load it for her.
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
Ooops.
You startled me.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
He's dead, you know.
Hello, Mother.
We'll miss you so.
She's fine.  Please--
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
She still has just the one child-- the boy?
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
And her fianc!
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
Are--are you crying, Penelope?
She's crying because she's so happy.
What a brilliant diagnosis!
Pacqualinincheewa root.
Would you say that again?
Everything about you is the editorial we.  Take that away from you, and you'd disappear.
You were wrong, you quack!
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
There's a certain amount of information there.
Lest we forget how cruel you are.
It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
Oooooo.  That hurt.
You're old--so old.
Now who's being cruel?
And terror, if you don't mind.
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
King Arthur.
You hope.
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
I've struck my blow.
With spittle?
My violin is avenged!
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
I'm utterly satisfied.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
If you want to be found that way.
What is this thing that kills me?
I've enjoyed being man.
Get up.
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
It's trash now, like mine.
New lives begin!
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Leave the rifle here.
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.
You don't know?
It was a bitch.
Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
She did?
You didn't even find that out?
There was so much going on.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
Jesus.
Alice is dead?
What will you do, Colonel?
I'm only ten years old.
I heard you were looking for me.
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
Premature ejaculation.
Something's made you sore.
Don't worry about it.
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
Don't!
What a relief!
I don't want to live any more.
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
Stay home tonight!
Oh, Paul--
He's a ghost!
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
A what kind of doctor?
You're the only woman he ever took out.
Still lives with his mother.
In a railroad accident many years ago.
I was afraid to ask.
A lot of people don't.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
I don't really know.
It's beautiful.
Who have you been talking to?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
No.
Then who flushed the toilet?
Father's friend.
Don't know.
That man is your father.
What?
I don't get it.
It is you, isn't it, Harold?
Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
He can hardly talk.
Then get him.
Okay.
You're taking Mom out tonight?
You're going out?
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
It's fine!
Keeps fairies away!
He isn't any friend of Father.
He isn't?
No!
That's something I suppose.
Something happens to my confidence.
Yeah.
Is he all right?
Far as I know.
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
Marry me instead.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
Take plenty of cigars.
We made the date three months ago.
The what?
Paul's only twelve years old.
That's been said before.
We met here earlier this evening.
How neat.  How keen.
I believe in miracles now.
It's really that bad?
Goodbye.
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
Is that a fact?
Or get eaten alive.
It's good.  Let him go.
I feel like I've been double- crossed.  If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday--
We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
You mean I'm black?
No, just not the type.
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
Big threat. TV would ream you.
I just want to ask some questions.
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
Well, I want to...
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. My name's Felice.
What do you mean?
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before.
I'm getting angry. I want some answers.  Where's the guy who runs this place?
Just one.
Yeah.
We offer...
Yeah, yeah...
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
I don't know no Tod.
What girls you got here?
Man, how many girls do you need?
That's Charity. She's out back. She'll be free in half hour.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
Yes. I think it'll look better.
If you say so.
Yeah. How did you know?
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
The other girl is the star?
She thinks so.  What do you do?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
You making a feature?
Um-hm. Live sound.
You know her?
No. I saw her with Tod.
Do you know where she lives?
Tod might know.
Where's he?
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
You're not a film producer, are you?
How much do you make a week, Niki?
Something like that. How much do you make?
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
Half now, half later.
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
When do we start?
Huh?
Ulcers.
Of Joanne's?
Yeah.  I'm her father.
She's dead.
You won't keep growing at this rate.
You know what I'm talking about.
'Sucking off.'
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
But it's all you do.
How important do you think sex is?
I care about my daughter.
Tijuana.
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
What does that mean?  What does he do?
He deals in pain.
Is Kristen safe?
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
What the crap?
No, please go on.
Yeah.  Well, mostly.
I thought I was fucked up.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Where does he live.
On your own land?
You wife isn't dead is she?
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex.
Where is he?
I can't tell you that.
Where is he, Niki?
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
So then, Mr. Mast...
Andy.
You are.
That's right.
Mr. Van Dorn?
Mast?
Yeah.
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
In G.R.? Why?
What are you paying me for?
I'll be there.
I don't know.
What do you mean?
That's like a stag film.
They're legal now.
They are?
I don't know.
Where did you get that film?
I don't know.
Do you think she's safe?
Yeah. Probably.
Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
Get out.
But this is my apartment.
Get out!
Who is Ratan?
I just heard. Who is he?
Just leave me alone.
But I'm here to help you...
Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
Pretty good.
How did you find me?
What?
What is going on?
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
I don't know.
Where!
What you got in mind?
I want to meet Ratan.
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
Rucker.
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
Take it or leave it.
Okay.
You ain't goin' nowhere alone.
Who?
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
They're all about the same. You want something?
I don't know what you're talking about.
That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
I don't know nothing, man.
That's all right.
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
He asked me. You going with anybody?
I don't know.
You ever play Chicken?
What's that?
You never heard of that?
Com'on, tell me.
Well, a boy goes like this, see.
Oh.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
To anybody.
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
Granville's looking for you anyway.
Who's that?
Well, he can just fuck himself.
You're taking a big chance.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
You working in San Diego now?
No.
Thanks.
Yes, I am.
And what are you studying?
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
Eh, Poli Sci?
Oh, I don't have one.
Come again.
How long have you been driving?
No, no. I just took it.
Hello.
None of that, lady.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
Is this your shovel?
No.
Possession of a stolen shovel.
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
Then whose name is it registered in?
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Where are the papers?
Because if you are...
Lady! Be quiet.
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
Not very.
I'm a file clerk.
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
What do you see?
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Eh, no.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
No, thank you. I have my car.
What?
Do you sing and dance?
Eh, no.
No.  I thought not.
Your hearse?
Oh.
Oh, look! The birds.
Well then.
Sort of.
All right.
Promise?
Maude???!
Eh, fine.
She seemed yare to me.
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
It goes on and on.
Oh. Eh, I like it.
Certainly a new experience for me.
Because they are all the same.
Oooh, but they are not. Look.
Look.
What?
Over there by the courthouse.
What is it?
But we can't just dig it up!
But this is public property.
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
He's fallen asleep, as usual.
What is that he's working on?
Yes.
Well, I really don't drink...
Oh, it's all right. It's organic.
No more revolts.
Oh come on. I'll teach you.
But I don't play anything.
Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
Yes. It's almost there.
Yes.
Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
It's all right.  It's organic.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Okay.
It's so blue.
Pray? No.  I communicate. 
With God?
With Life.
No. I'd feel stupid.
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
What is it, Harold?
But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Oh, you weren't scared.
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
Well, they're my species.
Yes. They're old friends.
Maude.
Yes.
I took them out.
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
You haven't changed a bit. I'll put it in my wallet.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
Oh, Harold. 
For you.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
"And this too shall pass away."
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
To whom?
To a girl. Here.
A sunflower?
Perhaps it is.
No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Like a tea ceremony?
No. Like this.
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
A rough estimate.
Yes. It does.
Why?
And a lot of time.
What about the draft?
You mean when I'm not working on a...
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
Huh?
None at all?
Well, maybe one.
You liked your teachers?
Yes.
Your classmates?
Yes.
Your studies?
Yes.
Then why did you leave?
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
Why?
What would you say?
To pit your own life against another.
Another man's life in your sights.
ZAT!
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
Oh sure.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Well, I don't...
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Souvenirs?
Harold!
She took my head.
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Oh yes. That's fine.
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Well, I didn't.
Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?
We've always been here.
We have no more surprises.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
Frank.
You knew?
Shit. Bull. Shit.
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
No. You look...
I know.
She certainly has.
It's coming.
It certainly is.
I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
You a doctor, too?
What?
So you slept O.K.?
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
What do you mean?
The boxes! I TOLD you.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
Yeah. The things you were talking about.
Are you crazy?
Kyle, you don't have...
Finish what?
Then why are you here?
I've come for my father!
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.
You were ALL human!
The Cenobites.
Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
We don't take hints.
I'm lucky that way.
I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
Didn't even buy me a drink.
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
-- Hound of resurrection?
Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
In private, if you don't mind...
Three days too late for that one, "professor."
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
Oh, I'll bet you have.
Air and sea backup. What's closest?
No. It's not.
C'mon -- Rasputin??
No. It was red. Bright red.
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --
Is it bad?
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
Oh, as opposed to -- ?
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Did he, now?
Got tired of me?
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
We're on the move.
Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
Okay. You saw the fish man, right?
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
Not so fast. He barely knows him --
Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then.
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
Each of us gets a belt.
I won't take 'em. They never work.
-- should go back. Now!
No. Don't --
I'm in charge. We go back!
My job.
Oh-n-no -- I --
No one ever helps me. It's my job.
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
Yes?
Goodbye.
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
No. I never was.
That's right, Stud, hold me down.
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
Hey. You: think twice --
What landed you this job, pushing "pamcakes"? Punctuality? What was your area of expertise?
Hostage negotiations.
Shh! Just a second.
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Start in, you got nachos coming.
Not hungry.
Not from you.
Good night.
How big can it be?
Goodnight.
No. Myers is taking me.
Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
Good.
...Polo.
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John.
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
Cocky.
Strong.
A brute.
I know.
What about you?
Coffee's warming me up.
What?
-- Late. Five minutes late.
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Pardon?
Two steps back, please.
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Oh, sod you.
What's the problem?
My fucking hand!
Hi.
Want to buy a bed?
Not much.
We're leaving.
Where's my father?
Do you really need this bed, lady?
Uh-huh.
Got her mother's looks.
Her mother's dead.
Julia's my second wife.
Lucky man.
It's just a puzzle box.
Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
You did this before, right?
Many times.
To a man called Frank Cotton?
HE did. I've seen him.
No. That wasn't the deal.
Stay the fuck away from me.
You can keep them.
I have to speak to my father.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
Kirsty?
You remember.
No.
Come to Daddy.
You want it?
Some things have to be endured...
Poor baby.
Bastard.
That's right. Who are you?
Oh.
I came for the wedding.
Oh.  Oh yes.
Well can I come in or not?
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
But you said --
Forget him.
Sure you are.
Oh my God.
Don't look at me.
Who are you?
I said: don't look.
Frank.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
What happened to you?
Ssh!
What do you want me to do.
Hurting.
One more. Maybe two --
Keep your voice down.
You're hurting.
Tell me, damn you.
You promised me an explanation.
A box?
What kind of doors?
You would be. They tore me apart.
So you were cheated.
I don't.
So where's the harm?
I said no.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Don't you care?
Maybe we should just leave --
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Well we can't just stay here --
I need a skin. Then we leave --
Hi. I got soaked.
There's a towel in the bathroom.
Which is where?
Just to your left.
Where's Daddy?
What's the problem?
I have to see my father.
Of course. There's no need to shout.
I was here this afternoon.
This afternoon.
I saw everything.
Oh my God.
We're going to freeze to death.
O.K. O.K.
Like who?
Just a thought --
Ah!
It's just been empty a while.
The best part of ten years.
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
No. I'm not.
So what's the argument?
No argument.
I hear you.
In here.
Why not?
We'll move in Sunday.
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
I cut myself.
Shit.
Let me see.
No, you're not.
So damn stupid.
You're done worse.
I'll be scarred for life.
No you won't.
I'm here.
Sweetheart... I've been calling you.
Just feeling a bit sick.
Oh, babe...
Maybe a brandy.
Sure.
O.K.
Kirsty.
I've seen worse.
Fine.
No. I'll do it.
What's wrong with you?
Don't go upstairs.
Come with me then.
Please...
What's wrong with you?
Please. I can't bear it...
I don't know where to begin...
What are you talking about?
It's better you see for yourself --
What?
Drinking alone.
Not much.
I wonder, maybe...
Just soda.
Plain soda?
Please.
Oh?
There's a first time for everything.
I suppose that's right.
You want something to drink?
I... suppose so, yes.
That's more like it.
Do you care ?
No, not much.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
No personal details?
That's right.
No.
We don't need a bed, do we?
I prefer the floor.
That's right.
Am I?
What's wrong?
What happened to me?
I'll get the doctor.
Wait a moment --
I won't be a moment.
Try me.
Daddy?
I got through.
Where are you?
I found a room.
What did you say?
I said: I found a room.
You'd like the house.
YOU'D like my room.
Do you want me to come over?
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
Of course. Every day.
O.K.
Take care, Dad.
Call me tomorrow.
I will. See you.
You like?
Me like.
Kirsty.
Sure.
I've forgotten.
Steve?
Yeah.
I love you, honey.
I love you too.
Maybe you should give it some time.
Of course.
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
He's gone.
Gone?
I don't believe it.
I'm afraid it's true.
I want to see.
No you don't.
Yes!
What's the problem?
PLEASE. You're in danger.
No. It's all over.
That's right. Cointreau.
So lie down.
Just upstairs.
I AM house-trained.
I thought we'd lost you.
I'm coming!  Sleep well.
Not that late.
What do we do if there isn't?
I see.
She's so damn... English.
Meaning what?
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
Oh no.
It's not what I heard.
Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
Are you alright ?
I've been better.
If I make it through the day.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
No, it's good to see you.
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
Can I lend you a hand?
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
What happened to you?
Don't let them take me, Steve --
I won't let anybody take you.
Will you GO, damn you?
Sure. Why not?
'Bye.
I don't know.
Really.
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
Say it.
"Little Latin Lupe Lu."
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
Oh, so what's the point then?
He offended me with his terrible taste.
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
What do you mean, "what?"
What are you snickering about?
I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
What am I missing?  What do you have to be happy about?
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Terrific.
My band.
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my idea.
You're not even coming?
Laura.  Her dad died.
Ooh.  Drag.
Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
No way.
Yes way.  It's really...
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
No.  We need the gig.
What do you think?  Dick likes it.
Do not get ahead of yourself.
NO--!
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
Oh well.  Nevermind.
Nothing.
Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
On Clark Street!
A couple blocks!  About six!
We work there!
You'd love it!
No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
Oh, hi.
Where's Rob?
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Uh.  That's me.
Your desert island top-five.
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Is there a difference?
What do you mean, four more?
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Is that it?
Sure, but is that it for the list?
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Yeah.
What's his name?
Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
Good weekend?
I'll tape it for you.
No, that's okay.  Really.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
Can I help you?
Yeah.
I want a tape.
-- FUCK OFF!
Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
"Abraham, Martin, and John." That's a nice one.
It's Vince and Justin.
Who's that?
I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
You look upset.
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Maybe I should talk to him.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get a drink.
Think about it, Rob.
We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.
Think about it, Rob.
We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
I should be so lucky.
Hi.
Hi.
Just the obvious stuff.
What's the obvious stuff?
I don't know.
What, what?
No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
It sounds stupid.
You won't like it.
Just ask it!
Is it better?
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
I haven't felt like it.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
Great... That's great.
I told you I slept with him.
I don't have your number.
It's me.
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
You don't ever think about other people?
Mmm hmm.
Those aren't mine.
Sure they are.
I guess I am.
Well, think about it.
Pigsty.
Who the fuck's Pig?
My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
Yes, of course.
Mmnn.
You're also an idiot.
What do you mean?
What do you want to do?
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
I didn't mean that.  I mean... was that all you used?
Okay.
Want to know what, exactly?
What it was like.
You know the difference.
Oh, great...
But what?
More confident, maybe.
Nothing.
Wanna go to dinner?
Where?
Just local, of course.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
Yeah.  His band is playing a set.
Not really.
I mean it.
I know.
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
No.  Probably not.
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
I don't know.
Very persuasive.
Are you persuadable?
So?
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
What's happenin'.
You called this morning?
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
What difference does it make?
Is Ray going?
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
Everything go alright?
Thank you.
Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
You haven't even seen it!
Nor have you!
Yes.  You?
Yeah.
Good.
That way.  You?
That way.
Right.
Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.
Everything all right?
Great.  Super-fantastic.
How's the store?
So so.  Up and down.
What do you mean?  Where did she go?
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
Then what are you getting so upset about?
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
Thirteen hundred.
Seventy-five.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
And I won't take a penny over ninety.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Well we don't.
I'm Vince.
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
Find the father.  That should clear things up.
Uncle Joey's little girl.  Can't get the taste out of her mouth.
Go to hell.
This one came unassembled.
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
Huh?
It's in good condition.
It's my birthday.
Happy birthday.
Thanks.
No thank you, I'm fine.
Why?
Carl Smith.
You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
Anything in Maryland is close.
Yes.
Very traditional.
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
Basil the II.
Probably.
Who?
Does Carl Smith?
I've been to Church Hill.
Tradition.
Not your concern.
He was innocent.
You?
You are being foolish.
Are you?
No one knows you're here?
No.  I had to talk to you.
You had to do _nothing_!
You're wrong.
You're a fool.
Maybe.
You've been listening to rumors.
When you finish, what then?
They do it each year.
There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
A little dusty.
That's impossible.
I hope I never get that old.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
Just a little crazy.
That would be difficult to explain.
I'd like you to try.
He knows about you.
He is older than I.
You killed those other two.
Not the same.
What about that family in '31?
You kill with your left hand?
I haven't killed _you_.
Is that a threat?
Come here, Brenna.
Damn you.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
All of it finished.
No!
You and I should talk first.
We've got nothing to say.
All fashionably without heads.
Spare me the details.
I want Taupin.
What were you doing in Felton?
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
It's that important?
Yeah.
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
Why?
What are you doing man?
-Et lux perpetua-
-Auditorium nostrum-
Stop.
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Stop!
Your name is Conor?
Aye.
You're not from these parts.
I was nearly killed.
But you lived.
You feel you know me.
I don't know why.
We are brothers.
You are still so very young.
I'm twenty-two.
Not even a single lifetime.
We are immortal.
No!
This is madness!
It is the truth.
No!
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
You'd have to die first.  Aqui.
Me arm hurts.
Again.  Try again.
Go to hell.
Muy Bien!
It's like to kill me first.
And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.
I have no future husband.
What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
Who?
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
Me father has taken back my hand.
You're not talking sense, Mara!
What would you like?
Something pretty.
Kiss me.
Certainly not me.
It's all we have.
Romirez is dust.
Finish yours?
Mulet.
Second musketeer.
You seem to understand a great deal.
We have no understanding.
Stay out of it.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Either you are with me or against me.
Have you time for some- thing to eat?
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
He's a MacLeod.
My father taught me.
Your father must be smart.
Yeah.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
No.  I want this to be all ours.
I don't know.
What name is he using?
How many came?
The last four.
And the Bulgarian?
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
Kahn?
Head still secure to the neck.
How did you find me?
Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
He always did.
-Since you last saw me.
You were never a kid.
You're insane.
Not so long.
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
Of sorts.
MACLEOD!
As you wish.
This isn't done.  Get up.
What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
It's all we have.
Go to hell.
Leave her alone.
Get up.
Are you here?
I want you to come to me.
And if I refuse?
Yes.
No.
That's none of your business.
You're wrong.
I presume it's a sword.
For the moment.
Where were you Tuesday night?
Home.
He's mistaken.
All I need is time.
But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
His only kid.
The resemblance is amazing.
When may I expect the cleaners?
I'll send them right up.
Same.
Just your pappy scared some.
Why don't you fellows get your own news?
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Well, congratulations! Good luck!
What's the idea of locking this?
That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
Open this door!
The poem?... The poem was great!
It doesn't have to rhyme!
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
Bon jour!
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
Better make that a certified check, Walter.
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
I lost my wallet.
The check, Bruce!
The Criminal Courts Building.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Hello, Bruce...
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --
Where'd she go?
Out some place.
Did you give her the money?
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
Yes!
Where are we going?
No. My mother.
I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
We could take the six o'clock train, Hildy. If it would save a man's life.
You haven't seen anything yet.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
I'm beginning to realize that.
Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
Gee! Take a look, will you?
Get out!
I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
We'll take a chance on that, Burns.  Go ahead, boys. 
No, you don't!
Do you want to get us scooped?
Get out of here, you!
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
The power of the press, huh!
What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
I haven't any hard feelings.
You can break it, can't you?
No, I can't.
Sure you can. Come on.
Just what I said. That's what I --
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
You bet I've got a better offer.
Sweeney.
Dead?
Keep away --
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
I'm not working for any other paper!
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
Bermuda.
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
He's in the insurance business.
The insurance business?
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
You're not afraid, are you?
Afraid? I should say not!
Now you got me.
Nothing personal. I was just asking.
Thanks.
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
Yes. Where is he?
She jumped out of the window.
I know. Where is he, I said.
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
We'll lower it out of the window with pulleys. Quit stallin'.
Huh!
All the words you've got.
Where's some paper?
Call him a love-child, if you want to.  Duffy!
All right, Walter.
Railroad tickets.
Finished!
Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.
What did you do with her?
What happened?
You been in a fight?
Louie!
Was she? Did you notice?
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
Come here. See if we can move it.
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
What is it? Here!
Who did you talk to?
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
And your arrest. You'll each get about ten years, I think.
Don't tell me you were worried!
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Flip a coin.
Then why are you doing it?
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.
Walter, you can't do that!
You -- you!!
You know you did!
Let me out! Let me out of here!
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
Western an' Thirty-fourth.
You got plenty of money?
Sure, boss.
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
I always have both.
I'm busy, Duffy.
He's on my phone. He just called me.
They can't do that to me!
No more interviews. Besides, a doctor's coming over.
I think it is.
A lot of money.  Four hundred and fifty dollars --
They're always after me for interviews.
Me, too.
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.
Point the gun at me!
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
Three bullets! Any good?
Beats king up.
Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
All right -- all right!
Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
Give me a hand with her, will you?
Okay.  Up you go, Mollie.
Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
What's the use? I can't win a pot.
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
What's the dope, Sheriff?
I'll have it in a minute.
So long, Hildy.
Now, where is he?
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
I can't complain.
Little rum in yours, too?
I guess so.
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
Good coffee, isn't it?
That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. I've got to get started on my interview. See you later.
Let go o' me. What's the idea?
Hold her, boys!
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
Nobody's trying to put anything over on you. I'm getting out of here and you can't stop me!
With a bag of marshmallows.
He can't hurt anybody. You've got his gun.
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.
Earl Williams. The reprieve.
No, I couldn't do that.
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf --
I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
What do you mean -- through?
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
An attempt to ruin us!
I did.  Hold the wire.
Cover up that transmitter!
Now what do you say?
Just -- one -- second!
Shoot to kill, I said.
If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
A sight for sore eyes!
Throw him out, Frank.
I never saw him before!
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
You'll take fifty and like it!
My name is Louis Peluso.
I'm telling you!
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
Was I? The driver got knocked cold.
Who is it?
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
Give me that!
I'll go right after it.
And up a dime.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
I thought so, too.
No -- what?
What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
First you got to sign a receipt. 
Where's the money?
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
That's good.
Mother!
I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
That man there!
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Isn't that her picture?
Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
I won't, Earl. 
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
How'd you get here, Earl?
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
Quiet, Mollie!
I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
Never mind! Just play dead.
Shut up, you!
Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.
The reprieve for Earl Williams.
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
How much do you make a week?
Who do you think!
The City Sealer's office!
You mean here in the city?
Yes, yes!
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
For heaven's sake, why not?
Is it hard?
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
You can't bribe me!
You're insane!
A very fine-looking women.
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
Hello, Mollie.
Come on, fellas.
Say, Hildy...
We want to see you.
-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --
What's he want?
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
She and Mollie were talking.
I know.
But Grandpa, you said...
Very well, Grandpa.
Only till they get you into the local school.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
No, she didn't.
Yes, she did, didn't she?
Yes, you was. Make him talk.
What's that?
Who told you that?
I don't mind.
Say them.
Sod.
Sod.
Bloody.
Bloody.
OK. You're in.
Would.
You couldn't.
Could.
You do it. You're a girl.
We thought it was poison.
Who with?
Pauline.
They've got the real thing outside.
It's not the same.
It's Canadian. Where'd you get it?
Thank you Billy, from the baby and me.
The sodding water table.
Air-raid?
I don't know?
I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
You need trees for an avenue.
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
Naturally.
Bugger the Buffs.
I will if you will!
And I'm still just a lad myself.
Don't bother to grow up. It's no fun at all.
And absent bridegrooms!
What's that?
You joined up.
Oh, that.
Jam.
It looks....foreign.
Jam is jam! It's just jam!
You taste it.
Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
Half the time he's bluffing.
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
Don't leave it like that. Go after him. Swallow your pride.
It's not. It's happening to me.
Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
No, Mother! It's War! War!
Or what?
How are we going to cope?
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
Play something, Grace.
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
That's right. Not since then Not since I got married.
A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
We did the decent thing.
We did all the proper things, and we lost love. That's sad, Mac.
You might still have a house.
I wish it could all have been different.
Look after yourself, Grace.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
Huh... what cone?
I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
What about R.J.?
Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
No, I told you...
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Oh, he's coming, he got something real special this year.
Who's your Daddy!
Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
Oh yeah, the tree.
Come on.
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Is your brother ready to go?
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
Yeah, come on.
You sure do a lot of guessing.
You're welcome.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
Whoopie fucking doo.
Nice.
I was just wondering.
Wondering what?
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
Fucking great.
You shouldn't a done that.
Why? You gonna do something about it?
Now, what makes you think that?
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
Ummmm... two hundred and eighty-five dollars.
Hey, wait take this.
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
I don't.
She's pretty cute.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
Really fucking awesome.
How much further?
Way out here?
Cat fight, cat fight.
Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
Well, technically I did what ya said.
You're a real fucking piece of work.
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
No problem.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
I know, this is fucking nuts.
Here he comes.
He won't move.
Turn that fucking radio off!
That food...  ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
There's a dog in the road.
There's not enough room.
Then run him over, he'll move.
What!
Fine! I'll go straight!
Don't worry, I'll be quick. Just stay here, no sense everybody getting drenched.
Just sit back and enjoy the show.
I gotta open the gate.
Drive through it!
It won't work.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.
Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
I don't know, I think he's funny.
This isn't funny, it's twisted.
Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
Rise and shine.
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
You got to be fucking joking.
I can't believe...
I don't know... about half an hour.
What? I didn't hear anything.
Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
I still don't.
Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
Recover any bodies?
Not yet.
That's the understatement of the year.
Yep, I found something.
Keys.
Open up the trunk.
Yes, sir.
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
What do they call you, sweety?
Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
Didn't ya think, Mary?
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
Aw, honey you know I can't do that.
You said it, not me.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
Don't worry, I'm gone.
Let's go see.
You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
Please, just a minute.
What! God damn, how many?
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Where we headed?
Shhhh... you hear that?
Over here, inside the smokehouse.
Shit... fuck procedure.
Call Wydell.
Yes, sir.
I'm Wydell... this is Naish.
I pray to God there is.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
Aw, fuck.
What.
Call the chief... We found 'em.
That must be him.
Excuse me for a second.
That is the wrong fork, young man.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
Great.  God, I've wanted you forever.
Gabrielle.
Like father, like son.
French?
Oui.
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
Not at all.
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
That would be good.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
Hmmmph.
Gabby, what is it?
Very well.
Stop. Get away.
What is it?
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
But I don't know how to leave Lila.
Hi. It's Nathan.
I just want to talk.
God, you're beautiful.
No. You look so beautiful.
No!
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
I don't know. Something's missing.
Oui.
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
Please let me go with you.
Okay.
It's okay, Puff.
Shan't happen again.
Very well.
Good. I'll show you how, apey.
Ouch. Yeah?
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
Shut up and tell me.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
Loves animals. Loves you.
What do you mean?
Won't he be able to tell?
My brother says he likes you, too.
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
No. I married a midget.
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
Three foot one.
And I think I'm going to.
Stand on a stepladder sometimes.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Please, honey, let me in.
Rose, please go away.
Lila, I want to help you.
Nathan told my brother.
Your brother should have his license revoked.
Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair?
Ready!
Oh, Rosie.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
I'm sorry?
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
Yes, and...
You really enjoy my company?
I like you, too, Nathan.
You do?
I don't care. I don't care!  Like what, for example?
I'll be out in a minute.
I'm sorry about my parents.
Why certainly!
Oh, and the sun block?
Of course.
What SPF, sweetie?
Fifteen.
Flares?
Absolutely.
I love you so much.
I don't know. Something.
A deer?
It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
Nothing. Be right out.
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
It would just be helpful to know.
Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
Sure. Of course.
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
That was wonderful!
Oh boy!
Thank you very much for that.
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
Ummm. It's good.
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Eat shit, thumbtack dick!  Thank you, Frank. You're the best.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
Tomorrow, the acid test.
Even better.
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
Yes?
Yes... Derek.
I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines.
Yep.
Pittsburgh?
Mm hmm.
Comin' in or goin' out?
Next game, ten bucks.
You want a chaser?
No.
You look different... More relaxed.
It's open...  What'll you have?
Soon as I finish my coffee.
I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?
And a fact is a fact.
She's a smart girl, Eddie.
We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
Do we need words?
To win.
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
You tell me.
Thank you.
It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
Good, good.
You ever played billiards before?
Oh, about five hundred.
Do you really think you can beat him?
The night is two thousand dollars old.
Twelve thousand.
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
What did he say?
Sit down.
Cut.
Deal.
Two.
Thought you only drank milk.
Yeah? Why?
Poker's not your game.
What is?
Pool.
You being cute?
Yeah. Sure, sure.
Maybe he knows how to drink.
Eddie, you're a born loser.
What's that supposed to mean?
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
Seventy-five per cent.
For who?
For me.
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
I don't know when it was.
Hi. How's business?
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Man named Turk Baker?
You know everybody, don't you?
Where do I sign?
What happened to you anyway?
Like I told ya. My thumbs.
Thinking about what?
Miss Packard. How do you do?
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
What's that supposed to mean?
Where?
Over there by the bar.
Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
Well, I win sometimes.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
How much?
'Bout even.
When do I raise the bet?
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
All right. Five hundred.
How're the hands?
They're fine.
I said we're leavin'.
All right, then. I'll play him with my own money.
It's a long walk.
I got time, Bert.
You want me to tell her for you?
You gotta be hard, Eddie.
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
I'm a businessman, kid.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
Who's he?
You name it, we shoot it.
Want some free advice?
You well-heeled, partner?
Oh, come on, stop stalling. Grab yourself a cue.
I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Fast and loose, man.
In the gut, I mean.
I feel tight -- but good.
Charlie, I'm gonna take him.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Eddie...
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
Get with what?
You don't need a drink.
Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?
Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
What for? To play Fats again?
Yeah, to play Fats again.
Yeah, that's what I think.
Yeah. Just like that.
Well, hello. Haven't seen you in a long time.
Glad to meet you.
A little, although I'm afraid I generally lose.
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
That's right. When?
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
Yeah, sure has.
Yeah. You must come again.
Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
Who's he?
Half and a dollar.
Gimme ten bucks.
Hi.
A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
You're a pretty good player.
How much are you ahead?
Couple of bucks.
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
Shoot.
Call it.
Heads.
Yeah, I'm quittin'.
Yes.
What?
Since four.
What bus?
Yours.
Eight o'clock.
Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
Thanks. I will.
Fair.
Can I sit down?
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Then why go to the bus station?
No, not always.
I used to be an actress.
Yeah? What do you do now?
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
So why go to college?
What do you do on the other days?
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
Fifth of scotch?
A day like any other. People come, people go.
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
Come here.
How did you know my name was Sarah?
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
Well, what do you want to know? And why?
At school. It's Thursday.
Oh, I forgot.
When you've got money, you'll pay.
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Eggs. How do you like them?
I've got something in my bag.
Oh, it's not bad.
Haven't you opened it?
No, why should I? It's yours.
No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
What's this supposed to mean?
That's right! And I'm sure you'll help me.
He knows. A lot.
Why did he tell you?
He's a gambler.
Is he a winner?
Is that what makes a winner?
You need the words?
Yes, I'm glad.
Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.
Nothin'.  Want another drink?
What do you want to tell me?
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
Oh, I don't know.
A week? A year?
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
Sure. Let's go home.
Come here. Come on, now.
Oh, grow up.
Why should I?
I'll be up later.
He went off someplace.
Just for luck.
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
California. Oakland.
Yeah. That's right, too.
Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
You name it.
Thousand dollars a game.
So do you, Fast Eddie.
That is not now, human!
My name is Robert.
Yes.
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
With them?
Yes.
We move.  Place to place.
Dark and large.  With vines -- no, not vines.  Not alive.
My wife.
Yes.
Where you lived with them.
Yes.
You want to kill them.
If I'm a hunter it's because you taught me to be!
You know what I mean.
I know it.  What do you want, Robert?
Have you always had it?
I don't know.
Have you looked inside?
Yes.
Humans.
Who?
I don't know.
Yes.
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
Well, it's not supposed to be done anyway.
What?
Please.
Only got one kind.
That's fine.
You got that right.
I guess you could say that.
Round back.
Yes.
Do we have to?
That's the Air Force Base.
If we want it, it is.
Let's check it out, Dad.
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
Let's see what's on the other side. Maybe we'll find some copper.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
Sure ... fine.
Was there anything over the hill?
What, Jim, what?
First lemme look at your necks.
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
I was so scared.
Better now, son?
That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
I left it at work.
Yes -- but ...
Is that all he said?
Why, yes.  Why?
We were having a little talk.
About what?
Can you tell me about that?
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
Why?
'Cause he wouldn't lie.
I don't see anything.
No, but it was here.
But it's not, Jimmy.
No.
Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
The State Police.
All their lines were busy.
Hide the car.
I know a way.
Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
What happened to your other slipper?
What? -- I... 
The back door was open.
What's his family background?
It's really nice of you to help us.
If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
You have to leave the White House.
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
Connie, don't hang up.
David? How'd you get this number?
Walk to the window. Right in front of you.
Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
He's not going to listen to me.
I take it you've heard.
He's a good man.
Better be. You left me for him.
Did it work?
You bet it did.
Punched the President? Oh my god.
My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
Then get them out of there.
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
So sue me.
Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
What's the bad news?
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
And the good news is you won't charge me.
What're you talking about?
Haven't you been watching?
Just do it!
That signal. It's a countdown.
A countdown to what?
Checkmate.
So think already.
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
College nickname.
You try Martin?
It's perfect the line is busy?
He wasn't the President then.
I'm making a mess.
This I can see.
What'd I say?
A cold? Of course.
We'll meet you there.
Just getting a feel for her.
Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
I can't shake her free.
It's not me. They're overriding the system.
You as well.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
I don't hear no fat lady.
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
Then God help us.
She should be shortly.
ETA with target; four minutes.
Better than we thought.
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
No Sir. Definitely not.
How do you know?
Well, er... it's slowing down.
It's doing what?
It's... slowing down, Sir.
He's doing a good job.
They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
Be careful.
Dick-weed!
You know me...
Yeah, but what an entrance!
Dick-weed.
Butt-munch.
Was his father stationed here?
Really? Ballet?
No. Exotic.
Oh. Sorry.
I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
I didn't even see them fire!
Command, Eagle One. Switching to "sidewinders." We're moving in.
We're already over Mach 2!
So push it!
Jimmy, stay with me.
It's all fuzzy.
I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.
We're leaving.
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
Deploy.
Air... water... your "sun."
And before here?
Many worlds...
What do you want us to do?
You are on your own?
Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...
And I am his.
There is no museum in Iskenderun.
Papers, sir. Got it here.
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
Did you say...? Uh, uh...
The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
You've got it!
All my life!
I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!
What is it?
It looks like a converted church.
Dad was onto something here!
Yes. Now we know.
I'm going after Dad.
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.
What?
It's war.
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
The Name of God...
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.
Where did this come from?
You could be more right than you know.
You know something, Doctor Jones? You're absolutely right.
We're through!
Yes?
I knew it was you --
Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
I usually don't.
I usually don't either.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Lower me down.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
Are you sure?
Pretty sure.
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
What?
I said don't go between them!
Mine, too.
What were they looking for?
The Grail Diary.
Uh-huh.
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
Don't know. Think of something.
How do you know?
Where is it? I want it.
My father didn't want it incinerated.
I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
Out!
It's important!
Then wait -- count to twenty.
No, Dad. You listen to me --
Don't call me that, please.
But what are you doing here?
I came to get you! What do you think?
I'll never forgive myself --
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
Thank God!
Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
Right.
Well, what was left of him.
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
If only I could have been with you.
There were rats, Dad.
Rats?
Yeah?
You did!!
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
Will you take it easy!
Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior??
Don't worry. He won't.
She talks in her sleep.
So did I.
My lucky charm.
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
Try and burn through the ropes.
What???
And the chair.
What?
Dad!
What?
Dad!
Head for the fireplace!
Oh.
...the solution presents itself.
What?
Stop! Stop!
My Diary's in Berlin.
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
Booby traps?
Marcus would agree with me.
Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
Ships that pass in the night...
We didn't talk. We never talked.
And do I detect a rebuke?
Dad, how can you?
Very well. I'm here now.
I don't know. We'll find out.
Fly... yes. Land... no.
What happens at eleven o'clock?
Thanks.
It's a new experience for me.
This could be close.
Dad, we're well out of range.
Get out of there, Dad!
Junior...
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
The penitent man is humble...
I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
Me?... Illumination.
Junior?! Dad...
Ready.
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
Come on -- come on!
I'll take the camels.
I don't need camels.
But, Indy --
No camels!
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
My soul is prepared. How's yours?
No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
My name is Kazim.
As I said before, we'd be happy to escort you to Delhi.
Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
Oh -- good. And maybe the present Maharajah is a little younger? And thinner?
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
There are no stories anymore.
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
Sorry, I thought we were just talking about folklore.
Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.
Lao She.
Nee chin lie how ma?
I don't like to show off.
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.
At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
Step on it, Short Round!
Okey-doke, Indy! Hold onto your potatoes!
Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --
Okay, Shorty.
It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
That's it. Pankot Palace.
Just a statue.
You don't like him do you?
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.
Behind you!
Read you loud and clear, Indy!
What?
You're betrayed Shiva. 
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
You will go to palace there.
No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again.
I don't understand. What's happened here?
I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.
Hey, he's not a waiter...
Who cares? Where's that diamond!
Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!
What do you mean -- how?
The old man saw it in a dream.
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too...
Their children?
A SNAKE!!
Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
It's pulling me deeper!
Don't let it curl around you!
Can you move your arm?
Just one arm!
It's starting to let go!
That's good -- you're doing fine.
I know the feeling...
I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
Just try and control yourself.
You mean we have to walk the rest of the way?
Maybe he likes older women.
I've never been so hungry in my life...
No -- real food.
I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
Dr. Jones?
You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
What -- the bug?
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
I'm going down.
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
I'm not leaving without those stones.
I want to go home...
So now they believe me.
Yes, they believe you.
There's got to be another way out.
Go!
Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
You got it!
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
What for?
I'm going to puke in it...
I know you did!
Who's you?
Try me.
I'm...inside you.
What's going on?
Don't do that.
Why not.
It wasn't him.
Who was it?
Me.
Al.
Yes?
This candid camera?
Yes.
Your name is Al...
Yes.
I see...
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
Do me a favor, Al.
Shut up!
Where are we now?
My place, can't you see?
No.
Nerve bundle! What are you doing? You just leave the nerve bundles right where they are.
Who am I?
Yeah...Who?
What are you doing in my head, Al?
That a new Datsun?
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
I just went there for a job.
Then how'd I get here?
You said it.
Loading a gun.
What for?
Kill myself.
Are you crazy?
Yep.
Hear voices don't I.
Of course you do!
Then I'm crazy.
Why he's argumentative?
With a man in my head...
Who was that? Somebody out there?
Why not?
I'll talk to them.
Oh...Gooood!
I'll tell you what to say.
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
This is a Fiesta!
Then what are you stopping for?
Too late...They want you.
Why? AL  You know too much.
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?
No. Don't tell the guards.
Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!
Why?
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
I am. You are.
You are CRAZY!
You gotta help.
I did. I brought you back here.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
I'm not gonna make it easy.
Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
I'll sue.
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
Go out, take your first left.
Just walk down the hall?
With Authority!
What does it say.
Corridor A.
Where are we going?
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
The man.
What do you mean?
Black suits and helmets.
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
Nothing!
I'm at the airport.
Good. Get to a phone.
What am I supposed to do?
Nothing. You just do nothing.
Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
Send a man there. A secret agent.
You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
We get on a plane.
We get on which plane?
What about it?
I don't have any.
Use my credit cards.
I can't do that.
Why not?
It's illegal.
Who cares?
I'll get in trouble.
You are in trouble. Now do it.
We'll change your appearance.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
You'll be me.
The beach?
Just get there.
What is it?
Good Idea!
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
The sand.
Eat it?
Eat it.
I don't want to eat it.
Why not?
It's sand.
What? What do you mean?
Are you screwing with any nerves?
What was?
A girl.
You're out of shape.
What's happening?
She doesn't seem to understand.
Try another language.
Which language?
How should I know?
What can I do? You're on your own.
Don't just stand there, say something.
.
Wait.
What?
...Rene...
To the hotel. To register.
Without your pants.
Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
I made it work.
But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
What are you looking at?
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
This...is not going to work out.
Not blue enough.
It is my business. It's my name.
But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.
Why not?!
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
The beautiful one.
You have no taste.
That place. By the window.
The drinks...Stay on them.
Are you serious?
Just hold them close and stay still.
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
Killer!
I don't know what's going on.
It lends you an air of mystery.
How do you know?
Voice stress analyzer.
She's the toughest to read.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
You're doing great with her.
Not her. You!
What is it?
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
What if she says something important?
You got any books in there?
Oh come on.
You shut down your sensors.
Joe! It's 56 hours!
Shit! You're in love.
It's not your time. I get time off.
You get time off to sleep.
Why don't you get out of my face.
You found her.
Better. I found Ryuji.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
Osaka?
Fountainhead of High-Tech.
Follow her.
On what?
Run, stupid!
That's not funny.
Just stay here and rest.
Where are you going?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Al, you leave my heart alone...
What do I do?
Relax. Let me do this.
It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
You think. That's what you're good at.
I told you, I have a feeling...
One of your instincts?
Don't worry!
Too late.
Drink lots of water.
You have to! Quickly!
...imagine a better grape for the region.
I can't see a thing.
Neither can they.
Never mind, just say it.
You were with GRUNER!
I don't trust her.
I've got an idea.
I was afraid of that.
Just say the words. Just like I told you.
You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.
haka xuki. What's that mean?
Cash.
While he makes the run.
Where?
I can't handle that thing.
Don't worry, I can.
And don't let her know, either.
What exactly?
I don't know.
Losing power. The laser drained it.
Never mind that, where are we now.
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
She works for them.
Now, you're too suspicious.
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.
You've changed your mind.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
Yeah, sure.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
I want to thank you for what you've done.
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
Aren't we all.
What part what?
The best part. She'll love it.
Don't give her your name.
Oh, I can't.
Good.
I insist.
Don't worry.
Let us get to the border!
Then what?
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
In him?
It's a long story.
ya hyutn slulptsa?
What a nerve!
Me.
Then how did you know?
I dyed it. We're all getting old.
**?!! 
They took the tapes.
You have nothing...
Surveilliance on them all.
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
We met on the beach.
Join us.
I have a new client.
That crazy guy?
Yes. Joe.
Enough ROmance.
He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!
We insist.
That name's familiar.
I think I've heard of you.
Your memory.
What about it?
It may have been affected.
Oh.
You may not remember things.
What things?
When you do...
Do what?
When you remember...
Remember what?
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Who...are you?
Fine. You look fine.
Thanks.
Well...
We're here.
Here?
Oh....Sure.
You'll feel better
I will?
What?
Take the card.
Oh yeah, thanks...
Why would we want to hurt you?
Not you. Them.
Who?
I don't know Who.
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Not...complaining, actually.
Been hearing voices.
You...him...UST.
Just give me the keys.
Whatever it is, don't do it.
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
This sophistication ain't tough. All it takes is a credit card.
Yessir...very good sir.
What do you want?
Nothing.
What did you say?
Nothing.
What?
Then who did?
I didn't say anything.
...I'm looking for someone.
No. No one to speak of.
I am confused. Or maybe it's you.
Blake?
Yes?
Where?
Dinner...tonight.
Oh...I can't. Business.
...right here too.
Haven't seen you around.
Do what?
Let you leave without it.
Without what?
Like there's someone else here.
Yes, of course.
Me still. They left you alone?
I waited for you.
Why?
...and sort of...disinterest.
I am sort of scattered.
Can I help?
Are you alright?
That you're not crazy.
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
Why do you do it?
If I was with you, I wouldn't
And how'm I doing?
You're doing...Okay.
...Naw. Made that up.
Who do you work for?
Is that Ryuji?
No. Ryuji just hires us.
Hires you for what?
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
And you, what do you like?
That depends...
Why'd you run off?
They left. I had to go with them.
Why didn't you tell me?
Wanted to get to know you.
You seemed interesting.
Who else is interested in me?
What do you mean?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
They kidded me a little.
What did you tell them?
There's not much to tell.
Why did they leave?
Sometimes. I told you I did.
Were you working for him last night?
He didn't.
No.
Who did?
You did.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
Food doesn't agree with me.
I'm leaving too.
Why?
This business is over.
I'm sorry. What will you do?
What's he done?
He must be a good friend.
What'd he steal?
A chip. Goes in a computer.
One chip?
Got to trust someone.
What is it?
Hiroshima.
Get your things.
Oh sure.
And Dieter.
Beats me.
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
Then where's the chip.
Get us one.
What?
Oh.
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
I know the territory.
You coming along?
This going to work?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
Can you?
Sure I can, can't I?
I can't fly it.
What'd...you forget?
They asked about you.
That I really don't know.
Now what?
It was my choice.
For you.
What?
I've never met anyone like you.
I'll come back for you.
Aren't you a little optimistic?
Her?
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
I knew it. I told him.
Now what?
We just don't stop.
Do something!
It wasn't me. It was him.
It was you.
He told me what to do.
But you did it. It was you.
That's twenty feet high.
We're not moving fast enough for him.
Yeah...I have to get away.
I know a nice island.
It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
...Piece of mind.
Why are you on to him?
I don't know.
A drink...
You can't take that.
Why not?
The experiment. The danger...
It is?
Just one. The back up.
Could I have it, please.
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Tear it apart?
Yes.
Ahhh...Okay?!!!
Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
Yes.
The other working.
Perfectly.
It'l be alright.
It will.
It doesn't hurt.
No?
Poor bastard.
What does he know?
Too much.
Whoever took it does.
So we better get started.
Hi, Daddy.
What's new?
Yeah? What for?
For reading.
She was playing with the Pooh doll.
Instant rice...?
What's that outside, Daddy?
Where?
That remote control thing?
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
Mom.
Yes, baby?
There's Dad, on TV.
Three hours.
You got a deal. 
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
Sure. Where?
I'll be there.
Monday.
Push it.
What? Forget it.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
Yeah. Catch you later.
What do you mean, what's it do?
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
Get me Wigand.
Sure.
...fuck is this? Fuck!
Maybe later.
How about you?
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
Oh, I love that stuff.
Then what are you going to do?
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
I'm afraid you are.
Yes, I'm afraid I did.
What caliber is your gun?
What caliber is my gun?
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
Hey, Lowell.
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Catch ya' later.
No, no, we're fine...
Are you sure?
"Mike?"
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
Jim, it's Lowell.
Yeah?
Don't you have to be at the office?
Yes, it's on the stove...
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
What do you need at the store?
Right now?
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
I didn't want to leave it there...
I don't understand.
Thomas Sandefur...
I'm doing an interview.
Where should I wash them?
Use the bathroom.
What's the difference...
That's for food.
Who's calling?
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
Did you say Berman?
Yeah.
"60 Minutes," the television show?
Yes.
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
Let me call you back...
Hello? Yeah...
..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
What?!
What are you and Mike going to do?
I'm alone on this...
Oh, baby...
Jeffrey...
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
I got perspective.
No, you do not.
...you fucked me!
Who is this?
Area code 212-555-0199.
I'll call you then.
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
No shit.
What's this?
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
Who are these people?
What?
I'm with Don on this.
I disappeared on you?
Alright. What did you think?
I think it was a disgrace.
Yeah, that's right.
Give me a break!
Everything interests me.
Yeah... Thank you.
How have you liked your stay?
What I've seen... I've liked.
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
Far as you go where?
Did work.
If you want to do it.
What are you talking about? Where are you?
Jump in, quick, c'mon...
Good. I want to talk to you.
This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
They should be.
It's obvious, isn't it?
Tempura...
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
No.
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
They do this with impunity!
Jeff...
Yeah, great.
I don't know what to do.
You mean... since this morning?
No. I mean since whenever...
No? No, what?
ABC Telemarketing Company.
You greased the rails!
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
You try and have a good time.
Yeah. Yeah, I will.
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
He doesn't seem to be listening...
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
What do you mean there is no family?
Liane has filed for divorce...
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
A delivery device for nicotine.
It acts as a drug on the body?
Object to the form!
It acts as a...
Object!
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
Howard!
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
After you, Doll.
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
Excuse me?
Here's her picture...
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
Mr. Dumbarton.
No...
Triple!
Who's the pigeon?
Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
Grounds?
Uh... poetry recitation.
We rest, Your Honor.
Mr. Massey?
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
I don't need it.
You want Botox?
What the hell is Botox?
No frown lines.  New watch?
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
Set one side for Bel Air.
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
I should be in therapy.
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
Thanks, buddy.
Is she Asian?
Asian? No.
Well... I'm still...
You have the pre-nup?
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
I already made my move, Kenneth.
What?
Yes?
What do you mean, was.
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
What is your husband's profession?
Ruth Rabino.
You like kids.
It's about time.
I said yes.
Oh boy. If he only knew.
Yeah. I guess. You know --
I'll be right back.
Isn't everything?
Did you see the tape?
Not yet.
How do you know?
I told you. I was hungry.
You don't believe in it.
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
No. I haven't. Have you?
And you've always loved him?
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
To him? He's a sick freak.
He's passionate.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
So I hear. Is that all?
No, that's not all.
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
Miles?
Yes? Marylin?
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
Okay Miles.
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.
Me. Yes.
Oh. And that is -- mom?
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
She didn't love you?
Apparently she was very disappointed.
Your mother was.
Oh right. You met Patricia.
No, we're not!
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
I want... I want to...
Yes, Miles. I accept.
You do?
I have a watch.
Hello Marylin.
I bet.
What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
May I come in?
I want to nail you ass.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
What kind of "stuff?"
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
That's marriage.
Marylin?
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
I fell in love Miles.
Marylin!
It's okay Joe.
Now. But first, he worked for you.
You were going to have this thug...?
I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
Hello Miles.
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Forgery? Fraud?
Income tax evasion?
Murder?
Murder!
I thought so.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
We are. And it's winding down.
Marylin.
My whole metabolism is -- off.
You have some?
Sometimes I forget.
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
Jesus.
You used his credit card.
He was right, wasn't he?
So. Now what?
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
Wow.
Oh, God!
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
I want to be exposed.
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
But you're going through with it?
Well, that's about to change big time.
I guess.
Yes?
When you have a moment.
She's here now.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
Heh heh.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
We've outlined a settlement...
Rex, please.
Now Rex.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
But then... But then...
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
She always looked out for me.
And she had private investigators assisting her.
In anticipation of making you sick.
Maybe I should reconsider my...
And she has...?
Video.
What the fuck...?
I am very sorry.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
No. You're not.
What are they?
Berry spoons.
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
What...?
She owes me a meal.
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer?
Miles.
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
The Judge is here. Over here, Judge Munson.
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
Yes, sir?
How is she?
Whyuhshe's all right, sir.
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Yeah.
Come in. Sit down.
And this is what you wantthirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
The reward.
Who said anything about a reward!
We'll go into that some other time.
Yes!  But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.
Why don't you put me in chains?
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not.  Yes?
Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
South America.
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
You talk as if he were a gigoloor something.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
Ah! Coconut layer cake. Nice and gooey, too. Just the way I like it.
Oh, hello, Dad.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
Oh, yes. I heard.
Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too.
Who is he?
Well, if it's as serious as all thatwe'll move heaven and earth to
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why
Yes. Peter Warne.
Why? Do you know him? 
Oh, nono.
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
Oh, please, Dad
Are you going to see him?
I suppose so.
Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.
She hasn't had a thing yesterdayor today.
Been sending her meals in regularly?
Yessir. She refuses them all.
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
Absurd!  All this fuss over a snip of a girl.  I'm going down to see her myself.
Lower the boats!
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that
Yes, of course.
I haven't the slightest idea.
They're practically all the same, sir. 
But the lady says
What happened to your money?
I was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me. She was ashamed, I guess.
. . . turn."
You win!
Yeah?
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
Are you talking to me?
Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.
Wellof all thewell  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
Why, noI  Yes . . . I guess I will.
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
No, thank you.  Thank you so much.
I found it on the seat.
Oh, thank you. Must have fallen out of my pocket.
What are you talking about?
That's right. You didn't.
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
No. It'd be useless. Father'd get the wire before they would.
You're on a budget from now on.
Yeah. Come onwe're stopping here for the night.
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
Oh, you did? What am I expected to doleap for joy?
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
You're not really serious about this, are you?
Not at all. 
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
The pleasure is all mine.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
I can't go out like this.
Like what?
Like this. I have no robe.
Heretake mine.
Heyyou're little, aren't you?
Where is the shower?
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
Must be the Spring.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
Um. You're doing all right.
KingKing Westley was in it.
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.
Well, you were!
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
It takes money to buy food.
Why, haven't you?
You didn't give that boy all your money?
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
Yeah.
I'm following you.
Aren't you afraid of me?
No.
Okay. Hang on to these.
Of course it is.
You're crazy.
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
You're prejudiced.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
What?
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you!
Well, take them off.
What!
Oh, Peter 
What's got into you?
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
Here. Eat your head off.
I don't want it now.
Thought you were hungry!
wasbut
But what!
was so scaredthat it scared
What?
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Hayin my teeth.
Raw?
Uh-huh. Want one?
You think it's simple, huh?
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
Mind your own business.
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
Eat a carrot.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him
If you do, I'll break your neck.
Come on! come on! 
What happened?
A black eye. 
Why not?
I love you.
You're forgetting you're married.
Congratulations.
Same to you.
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
sixseveneightnine
I'm out! I'm out!
Whome?  Want to see me?
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Won't I ever see you again?
Left twenty minutes ago.
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
When does the bus leave?
In about fifteen minutes.
Thank you.
Isn't he here?
Why, he'll be back.
Ain't gonna wait a minute.
That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
Yes?
Eight o'clock.
Just your imagination.
What's 'at?
I said, the old man's screwy!
Bridge washed outaround Dawson.
Up yonder. See the lights?
Yeah.
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Thanks.
Huh?
Don't accept any more.
Wait a minute, GordonI
Get out!
Don't "Joe" me.
Well, I got it, Joe.
Who's she gonna marry?
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
You!
Yeah.
Okay, pete. 
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
What?
I ain't got a hat.
Yeah.
They're married all right. I just seen the license.
Collect?
Collect.
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Yeah, you'll have to git .
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Zeke.  Git!
Yes, Ma.
What's the idea?
Yeah. Come oncome on!
Five G'sor I crab the works.
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
I can use a smart guy like you.
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Yeah. Just babies.
You love them, don't you?
Oh, gee, Misteryou wouldn'tyou ain't thinkin' about
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
No!... Shaw!  Director of The Trade Mart?  This is incredible.
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
Keep saying what?
You're not digging.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
Yeah, strange guy.  Dave introduced him as...
The anonymous kind, Chief.
That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
Where you going, boss?
I don't know, Bill, I just don't know.
Why?
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
No, I did not.
...ever called Dean Andrews?
No, I did not.
...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
No, I did not.
Thank you... Mr. Shaw.
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
You still questioning any Cubans?
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
It leads farther than that.
I got no place to sleep.  I'll meet you in 20 minutes.
No, I never saw him before in my life.
What was so appealing about Houston?
And then Sunday?
I believe the boys got a couple.
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Would you say this "Leon" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
Yeah, yeah.  But leave me alone for awhile.  I got to make some calls.
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
Hi, Freckle Face.
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
Four to six.
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?
I know.
A Perry Russo?
No.
A Willie O'Keefe?
David Ferrie.
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job.
Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!
Tough day.
Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
Huh?
Well... yeah.
You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw too much stuff like this in the war.
Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who would be running that training?
Take a look across the street.
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
Between six and seven seconds.
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
Yes.
Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
And he never hit you before?
Never touched me.
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
If you buy what you read in the paper.
Was he there often?
And Oswald?
Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
The assassination, Jack?
You're so naive, mister.
I just don't want to do it.  What else?
Splendid, love to see them.
Germany.
How many men are working with you on this?
Virginia or Elizabeth?
Virginia.
And how tall are you?
Do you walk home?
Uh huh.
Thanks.
But then you told her you were home.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
Yes, Max, I understand.
I'll call her.
I won't forget.
You were there for me.
Who?
You.
How old is that machine gun shit?
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
I need a favor.
That requires me goin' out tonight?
A bit.
Let me finish. Can I finish?
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
I can't believe you do me this way.
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
I found out.
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
Hey, Jackie.
She wants to make a deal.
She almost sounds scared.
What's she want?
She wants to go back to work.
What's she willing to give us?
What's in it?
Beauty products.
That's my diet shit.
Thanks.
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
Can you do it or not?
Fine.
What's her name?
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
But you're not going to stop her?
Who do you think I am?
Can I see your I.D.?
In cash.
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
I thought you might want a drink?
I'd love one, but not there.
It's kind of a sports bar
Why does it need to be dark?
That's him. How do you know 'em?
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
Same as you. Ten thousand.
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
No, you didn't. What branch?
With ten thousand? Nine.
He's got that kinda money?
I am. Have a seat.
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
You went out this morning and bought a gun.
Yeah.
Sure.
Uh-huh.
Who is this?
The Delfonics.
'76?
'74, I think.
It's nice.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
He told me last night.
He called you?
He came by.
What?... What'd you do?
We talked.
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
You're not old. You look great.
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
Bigger?
Yeah.
Surprise.
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
What'd ya see?
"American President"
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
For now. These relationships never last too long.
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
She's adorable. But I had to end it.
How old's Annette?
I don't care.
I go back to work tomorrow.
You talk them into it?
They seem to like the idea.
Right around here, in the food court.
Sit down, leave the bag under the table?
Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
The day you got me out of jail?
Did you do it that night?
More or less.
Do you think they bought it?
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
In the bag underneath.
What if he checks it?
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Set him up.
Uh-huh.
Tell him I want to give him his money.
Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?
I hesitated taking that much.
I told him I might.
I didn't say you did.
I never lied to you.
I know.
We're partners.
Spain.
Madrid or Barcelona?
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
Sure I can't twist your arm?
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
I thought you were tired of your business?
I'm just tired in general.
Are you scared of me?
I beg your pardon?
And cooperate? You might get probation.
Not every day?
Then you don't see him for a few days?
He say is a surprise.
Yeah?
What the fuck is that shit?
I know what it looks like.
You planted that shit on me.
Can I smoke?
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
If I'm working, I can help you.
You never asked me if I did or not.
You ever see him sell guns?
Not really.
I imagine shit needs to be done.
We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.
Who's the other one?
What did you say?
Uh-huh.
Was she there?
She didn't say.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Uh-huh.
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
You didn't count it?
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
That would be one point of view.
I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
Not in the fitting room.
You'd take a polygraph on it?
If it'll make you happy.
I sure hope you haven't done anything dumb Jackie.
What about you?
Buy ya a beer?
I'm waiting for the phone.
Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway.
Great...  ...Wanda!
Gimme one anyway.
What were you two fighting about?
That coke was yours, wasn't it?
You already knew that?
Kinda.
Dreaming.
Hi, Melanie.
Are you getting that black suit?
Yeah, do you like it?
It looks good on you.
You betcha.
Got some o.j.?
Yeah.
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
And what was your answer?
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
I knew it.
I didn't tell 'em anything.
You thought right... Now take your hands from around my throat, nigga.
Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
I understand woman, damn!
Go sit over in that chair.
All your money's in Mexico.
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
I told them.
They already know it's you.
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
If you want.
Yeah, I think a woman.
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
So we need two people, two women.
Can you cover that?
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
I'll give ya ten.
Plus the same deal as before.
I can do that.
Who?
I was there, I saw her do it.
Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
I can sit through it once.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
Sure.
Four days ago.
Where at?
Susanville.
How long?
Two months shy of four years.
Uh-huh.
What for?
Bank robbery.
Really, I'm impressed.
Yeah, there's another hit left.
What's a Metrix?
Fourteen.
Yeah.
I thought you were sixteen.
Where were you?
Detroit.
With Ordell?
We had done time together already.
No.
C'mon, don't lie.
I don't like dancing.
Did you ever go I one?
You been to Japan?
I lived there for about nine months.
About five years ago.
Sure.
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
Yeah.
So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?
Does that bother you?
You live with him.
...and just take it from him.
All right already.
Are you sweating?
Fuck you. I can carry it.
Gimme that bag before I knock you out and take it.
Yeah, down the end.
You sure?
Who's your partner?
As low as two.
Are you serious?
Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
Which one is for the car?
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
Whatcha watchin'?
I dunno.
Uh-huh.
That was Beaumont.
Who was Beaumont?
An employee I had to let go.
What did he do?
What's your relationship?
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
What does that mean?
I told you, man.  She my fine little surfer gal.
Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
Did you get it?
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
I shot her.
Twice. In the parking lot.
Couldn't talk to her?
You know how she is.
You couldn't just hit her?
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
You shot her twice?
Uh-huh.
So you're sure she's dead.
Pretty sure.
Where did you shoot her?
In the chest and stomach.
What?
Where's the rest of it?
How much it there?
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
You said five hundred and fifty!
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
We went to the parking lot.
Where you shot her.
That's right.
Pull the car over.
It's in there.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
What?
Where would you like me to put my ash?
He's a big one. You two tight?
You have it with you?
I know that.
Beaumont. That's the only name I know.
Livingston, huh?
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
House.
Yes.
I got some more business for ya.
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
What?
You didn't hear?
Hear what?
What does she do for you?
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
Is that what I think it is?
You keep fuckin' with me, you're gonna be asleep forever.
Git your ass in here.
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
Winston found you.
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
All I did was walk out with it.
And you did that to protect my interest?
In a way, yes.
And where's Jackie?
She's been there since Thursday night.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
Call her, tell her the combination.
I know where it is.
Turn left.
I know where to turn.
Uh-huh.
You sure?
Yes.
You better be, motherfucker.
You know it's for you.
It's Beaumont.
'Ola!
Let me speak to Max Cherry.
He leave town?
He's around.
Give me his home number.
I'll give you his beeper.
Where do you want to go?
Take me home.
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
I'm alive.
Then what are you doing here?
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
Let me out of here!
No! Oh God.
It's fun.
What do you want?
Just to see you. That's all.
Well, how do I look?
Like Della.
Are you all right?
I'm okay.
Oh God!
You're hurting me!
Stop!!!!
Daddy. Let go.
What do you want from me?
LET GO!
I could have told you that.
Short? It's ended.
Oh, terrific.
Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
Hey, wait!
Don't bother to call again, okay?
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
It was the window.
It's cold.
Tell your mother.
Mom, it's ...
Now what?
Don't go.
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
Why do you say that?
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
That was set. I'm tellin' you.
He told me he was going to Hell.
A couple of weeks, I think.
No. Not really ...
Shit!
An explosion, just like Paul's.
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
I say you should get a shrink.
What can I tell you?
Her knee acting up?
A bit.
What did she have to say?
Sarah.
She talk about the boys?
You should go back to her.
Wiggle your toes.
I know.
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
I've seen it. It's all pain.
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
Jake, you need to rest.
Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
Likewise.
I haven't seen her in months.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
No.  I see them.
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
I need your insight, your intuition.
Carlson? Is he new here?
New? He's been here for years.
Jacob Singer.
It's freezing.
I'm not cold.
Go to sleep.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
Save me!
Your back? Did you fall?
Who did?
Why didn't you turn on the light?
I didn't want to wake you.
Gee, thanks a lot.
Where is the lamp?
Where to?
Thanks.
What do you mean?
The room!
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
Don't ask.
No. Have you seen my glasses?
Where'd you leave 'em?
I don't know.
Did you look around the headboard?
Jezzie, I can't see.
Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
Your kid dropped it off.
Who? Jed?
No. The little one.
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
They're weird names.
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
I don't let anybody call me that.
A good lay.
And look what I got.
The best.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
Why you left.
Look at her face. A real bitch.
She looked good then.
Not to me.
I just want to look ...
How's it going?
What's wrong?
I enjoy crushing into you.
When was the last time I said a word?
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
Come on. What were they, Jake?
Oh, come on. It's early.
Where are we?
Where?
Where's Della? Bring her here?
Why? What for?
Show me Della!
Hey, I'm here.
If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
It's gone to the top.
How high is that?
The numbers stop at 107.
Get your clothes off.
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
Get your clothes off!
Coming here?
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
What kind of man are you?
Lie down!
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Hey, I'm not dressed.
With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
I know.
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
Why didn't you call me?
He said you didn't have one.
What's he talking about?
Jezzie?
Who else were you expecting?
Let go!
I want to know. You tell me!
It might be for me.
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
What's gotten into you?
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
I can waitress. I'm good.
I promise.
Please.
I love you when you're angry.
Oh yeah?  Try leavin' without me.
Where are they?
Sit down.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Where have they gone?
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
I don't know you.
You've lived with me for two years.
Jake, what is it?
I'm tired.
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
You can have anything you want.
Then don't bug me.
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
West.
Where's West? New Jersey?
Don't be funny.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
Sit down, Jake.
Where are they?
Sit down!
Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
You know who I am.
Observation, mainly. Clinical study. You were one of the survivors.
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.
It's strong stuff.
Pleasant dreams.
Just relax.
What's happening? Help me.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
Better living through chemistry, that's my motto.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
Yeah, you and everyone else.
I know. That's why I'm asking.
Hot. Where do I sign?
You got a nice tan, though.
Total delirium.
Please come quietly.
We're not going to hurt you.
What is wrong with you?
What?!
Total delirium.
He'll never make it.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Help me!
Call my chiropractor.
We're doing everything we can.
Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
Lennox Hospital.
I'm awake?
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
That's a lie. My family was here.
Of course it is. What else could it be?
Jacob Singer?
Speaking.
Paul Gruneger!
Paul Gruneger! Well I'll be goddamned!
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
Nope.
I just need to talk.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
I don't know.
You in trouble?
Yeah.
I don't know what to do.
Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
I've seen them too ... the demons!
You've seen them?
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
A car accident.
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
How did it happen?
No one knows. They say it blew up.
No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
Bring it in.
Is he all right?
He doesn't like it.
Okay. My husband's got two more bags. He's coming. They're heavy.
Punk?
You got lucky.
Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
Oh, come on!
Alright, asshole.
What do you mean, not enough time?
We don't have time to argue!
Could you show a little compassion?!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
No.
We don't have a choice!
What?
I don't know. Nothing.
We made it?
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
Get out of here!
What?!
Kkinsa! Open the doors!
He....He...
He came for me, I had to run!
Cool.
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
Where'd you get the gun?
I think I broke my arm.
Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
What are you gonna do, tell me?
They're back here.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
What are you doing back?!!
Let's move out!
Thorgan, suit up.
Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
We could convert fission transistors.
Bring 'em all. Let's move!
Then stop talking and work faster!
I don't know!
And now we're all out of it.
Suit up.
Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
My job.
Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
You just keep an eye out.
Yeah yeah. Got it.
What?
Where is he?
Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
Negative.
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Give me a break! What happened?
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down.
I'm pulling, damnit!
We have to get off this ship.
No you don't!
I guessed.
What if we don't?
And what happend to ...?
Not so bad.
Oh sure, all the time.
Okay, good tip.
You'll be fine.
I think I had some when I was eight.
I'm stuck!
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do.
She broke my fucking nose!
She needs a little time.
More time...shit, she's had 400 years...
Oh I like her a lot.
No shit. I got no problem with that.
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
We're screwed.
He's right behind us!
Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
Again?! Jesus!
You lost the charge?
He was chasing me!
Close the fucking door!
NO!
GO, GO, GO!
Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
Just get us to the ship!
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
Small brains make your balls itch?
That ought'a help the situation.
Let's just get out of here.
So what else is new?
A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
You're leaving me here alone?
Later.
You prefer an apple?
Oh my God! Adrienne?
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Crutch?
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
Kay-em 14.
Barbie from hell...
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
You need to get laid!
You killed him?
Oh shit! There he is!
Sory...
Come here, might as well fix that arm.
Ow!
Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
Who are you apologizing to?
Good point.
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
I missed you too.
I love you.
We're missing two of the kids!
This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
Defense droids. I'm on it.
No! He's coming with us!
Ssh.
I just know.
Keep trying!
Thirty seconds.
I gotta go back.
But?!!
We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
See you then . . . doctor.
30? How long was I out?
That's right, now if you could...
Get him out of there!
You wanna die?
Are we locked down?
They can deal with this sort of thing.
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
4You're not going anywhere.
Three...two...one...
Hockey player? He's not a ...
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
Sure but what good will that do?
It's okay.
My boat's neat, dad!
I want him out of the ocean.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
Just a favor for your old man.
Here --  Take him home.
What?
And incidental damages, if any...
You got it.
Try some of this. I made it myself.
I know who he is...
He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
It's my charter. My party.
Nobody. We're drifting with the current.
...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
Don't tell me my business!  Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
C'mon. Middle appendix --
I almost had 'im.
Tattoo. Had it taken off.
The bilge pumps. There --
Shut up! Just pump her out!
Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call.
No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
Have to pump her steady, s'all.
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
Full throttle! To port!
He's taken him!
Do you see the kids?
Probably out in the back yard.
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
Give me 30 years, I'll get it.
Feed the dogs.
Don't be silly - You're going to make summer better for them...
Older, sillier.
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water...
Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
Where is he?
He's sitting in it.
Michael! Come inside!
Thank you.
No. Home here.
You going to be all right?
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
What'll I tell the kids?
Tell 'em I went fishin'!
I didn't agree to that!
Why?
Just sign it, Larry.
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the Oceanographic Institute. 
Swell.
Let's all have a drink.
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
Our friend, the shark.
Florida license plate.
He ate a car?
What do we do?
It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
I wish it would rain...
This is quite a place.
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
It's a whale out there.
Just keep kicking.
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
I can't imagine why.
You picked her up on the ferry.
I didn't know her.
And nobody else saw her in the water?
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
Think she might've run out on you?
Some friends and me took a house.
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
We never had any. What's the problem?
Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer.
What else could've done that?
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind three nibbles back.
Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
Do I set the goddam hook?
Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!
Is anyone having this...?
I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
Is that a boat?
Well... is everything all right?
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
Down here, Hooper!
Fasten the pole.
What do you see?
25 feet. And three tons of him there.
Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.
Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
The shaft is giving.
No way! He can't!
He's under!
I don't have it.
I don't think so.
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
You know how I feel about her.
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
I just hope you don't consider her a close friend.
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
I don't know...
I'm pregnant.
I know.
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
But you copy my work every week.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
Or something.
I'll try to drop by later.
Well, I do.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
Were we together?
What?
I still have your virginity!
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
Huh?
Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
What, you mean as friends?
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Okay.
Oh, hey Vijay.
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
Did you hear it's yours?
Yup.
What a trip, man.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
What is your job title, exactly?
Excuse me?
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
Hon, did you get expelled?
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
I know enough.
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
Geeeerta Rauuuss!
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
Sorry. I was just getting something.
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
I did steal a squirt of perfume. What do you think? It's Clinique Happy.
Blood and guts.
We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.
I rock a Harmony.
Oh.
Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
Yeah.
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
No, more commercial stuff.
Like what?
Oh.
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
No, he's the dad.
You know... it's parts...
I know what junk is.
Yeah?
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
Uh, thanks.
Why? What the big deal?
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
Is Vanessa here?
Nope. We're safe.
You're gonna like this, I promise.
I actually know this one.
You do?
You've never been to a dance, have you?
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
What are you?
I don't know.
What?
No?
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
No thanks. I'm off pills.
Well, it was nice seeing you.
Sure.
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
Oh really?
Then what's going on?
I went to the doctor today.
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Nothing.
Your name, please?
Juno MacGuff.
No thank you. I'm off sex.
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
Yeah, like people in love.
Tore up from the floor up?
Thundercats are go!
I am a suicide risk.
Is this Juno?
Only the one in my pants.
Dude, I'm pregnant.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
Share the love, Tits!
What?
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
Well, you are kind of... convex.
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Eww, he's all beardy!
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
Are you looking for any other compensation?
I want to be a mommy so badly!
Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
Can you see it?
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
Don't mock me.
Looks like it, yeah.
Have you found a place to stay?
A hotel?
It's a loft.
Aren't you the cool guy?
I suppose anything's possible.
Carrie.
...Thank you.
...Yeah.
Is it hard to learn?
So you don't do any of those things.
He whips you?
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
It's a portfolio of my work.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
Took 'em all.
No it is not!
Hold still.
Adele... are you serious?
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
...Anything else?
What?
Almost.
I heard that.
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
As many times as it takes.
I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.
Walter Livesy.
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
Turkey mostly.
What do you need a Bible for?
Best kind.
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
How much do I owe you?
Forget it.
Henry Lucas.
...Then some.
Now why is that?
You wanna hear mine?
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
Nah... how much money have you got?
No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
If you say so.
Damn right I do.
What happened to Adele?
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
Thanks. What are you doing?
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
We don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out.
Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
Up yours.
I heard that.
Fuck!
Take your time.
Look again!
Why, what did he do?
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
Nervous?
Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
Where's Adele?
No, thanks, I can manage.
...Brian hurt his foot.
No, never. Excuse me.
Everybody just shut up!
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
...Janitor's job.
Who are you?
His Parole Officer.
Where would we find him?
No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
...That'd be my guess.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
17.
Yes. Altogether.
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
With how many people?
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
Were they wearing condoms?
Was up bitch?
You fucked it?
Did what take?
How long did you fuck her?
What?
You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
Are you hungry?
What for? That guys a dick.
Probably.
He lives on 76th?
78th.
Den less go Joe.
Yeah.
Did she suck your dick?
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
You down with the boost?
Unzip my pack, yo.
He looks like my uncle.
Who?
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
Oh. You like her?
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
Why I do what?
That.
Why I give pennies?
Yeah. Why you give money.
Good luck?
Shut the fuck up.
I don't know. How much do you want?
You are?
Why not? You stink.
Nothen' B.
Where you at?
Right here.
Where you goin' tonight?
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
You goin'?
Yeah.
You sure?
Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
I'm gonna fuck you up bitch.
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
Right now?
Yeah. Come on.
Hold on.
Is it cold?
At the block party?
Yeah.
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Come on. You can rave on another night.
Yes.
Trust me. Don't be nervous.
I just know. I know you'll love it.
But I'm scared Telly.
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
Of course I do.
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Here. Swallow.
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
What things? I'm telling you, nothing's going to change.  I want to make you happy. That's all.
Of course I do.
What?
Come dance.
Telly is at Steven's. There's a bunch of people over there. Come on dance.
I guess so.
15.
Were you protected?
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Everything is wrong.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
You are being ripped open.
I know.
Did you bleed?
I didn't bleed.
You didn't?
Boom!!! Boom!!!
And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know.
Good luck.
I only did it once and...
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
I gotta find him.
I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
Have you ever swallowed it before?
Sweet.
It's like...
It's really slow. It's slow boring.
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
I hate 'em.
You've heard the stories right?
No.
Oh god. That's horrible.
Holy shit. That's all true?
What?!
Hi Telly. Where you been?
When are you gonna be back?
Not too late.
Four-thirty in the morning?
Not too late.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
It's me. Telly.
Hello?
Paul it's Telly. Open up.
Nah.
I don't know, eight or nine.
Where does everyone sleep?
It's grandmother style.
It's very monotonous.
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
Yes.
What kind of problem?
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
You are!  I don't like you.
Fine, don't ask me out on a date.
You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
What?
Maybe you should.
You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
No it wasn't.
You ever do any hunting, Peter?
No, I need the original note.
There's a photostat of the original on the wall.
Then what's he talking about?
Homesearchers.
You're a lying bastard!
Get off me!
Sit down!
What was your relationship with her?
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
Anything?
It's a voice modulator.
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
Did anyone stand out?
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
But a hundred men could move him.
He was with me?
Who is this?
Just a second.  Hello?
To get your attention.
Did you know her?
No, only the path she chose to travel.
You'll find her.
Not really.
Why her?
Because she's the type.
But you said you didn't know her.
Pain?  Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have.
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time.
Very good.
The police haven't told you?
You sonofabitch!
Emotional?  I expected more from you.
I've figured out the message.
The game's over.  You lost.
It's me you want.  Not her.
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
The pipes.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Never mind.  He died two years ago.
New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
Fuck off!
I just can't believe it.
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
He already did once.
Why did he what?
Come here.
He was watching you.
Uh huh.
I'm Kathy.
Of course.
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
Nice meeting you.
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
That has nothing to do with it.
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
Nothing.
For what?
But you promised.
Who's Kathy?
Six, eight hours tops.
Any sign of rape?
You mean, no prints but hers?
No Frank.  No prints.
Yeah.
How long she been dead?
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
What do you think he did?
It's important.
Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
This ain't no photo.
Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
That's a big area to cover.
About a quarter to one.
What does that mean?
You don't have a shred of evidence!
Okay.  Why don't you go out there. We'll check in with you later.
Through a rental agency.
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
That's alright.  We'll take it from here.
"Is".  Did you tell him about the institute?
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
He uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  Singular.  Not can't move us.
Are we going to go through this again?
I went out.
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
I signed the confession.  What about the car?
Then I'll transpose.
You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
Just thought you might want to talk.
Whatever's on your mind.
Who says something's on my mind.
Mate in five.
Exactly... and you did this.
Feel like practicing?
Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
We'll call you back.
It's alright.
Uh huh.
Are you one of the players?
It seems like such a complicated game.
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
Do you always open quickly?
Are we talking about me, or chess?
Getting too hot in here for you?
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
She could be dead after the game.
She could be dead now.
I don't think I could.
It wasn't intentional.
In a way.
This isn't a game.
Do you?
Let's change the subject.
Why?
Because I work with them.
You're not?
How could you?  Unless you were there.
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
No.
Why?
Because I think he's wrong.
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
I'm sure you are.
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
Wasn't I just talking about me?
No.  You were talking about chess.
Alright.  What about me?
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
She died in a car accident.
I'm sorry.
It must've been very hard on Erica?
Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
What is this?
Then show me who you are.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
Would you settle for pepperoni?
The line was busy.  I'll try again.
I thought you said the line was busy?
I tried again and got through.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Exactly.  It's the key.
Where's the note?
Can I come in?
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
Why?
Because she killed herself!!
Why not?
Because I know what it says.
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
It's got to be grammatically correct.
Frank told me.
He didn't tell you either.
Are you going to come tonight?
Yeah.  I'll be there later.
I got lucky.
I'm not nervous.
Well, then this time you'll have to stay for the whole match, won't you?
I don't have to go through with it either.
Well, you're beautiful.
I have no intention of getting used to it.
We're almost married.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
Never mind my ears! Go away!
I can't.
About what?
I can't wait either.
Colwyn.
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
Colwyn ...
Where is the Fortress?
I will find you. I will be with you.
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn.
All the passages are guarded.
You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
All directions are the same here.
That way. I can feel the cold.
Yes.
Of course it was.
I won't leave you here.
Does the Queen live?
The new Queen lives.
Turold's son was to marry her.
But there is another entrance to this place.
Reach out farther. Call to her.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
What do you see?
Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.  Wait.
I'm not sure.
But you suspect.
You will know, in good time.
He has come for Lyssa.
Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
Where the spiral begins.
She can see the Beast!
No! You cannot know that!
I can. Because I choose it.
I forbid you!
We must enter the swamp.
What will happen?
You have done it?
I road them often in my youth.
Yes. It is today.
Each to his fate.
Even by you?
Yes.
I ache with it.
Let me comfort you.
I cannot take comfort when she has none.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
I cannot.
Staying alive.
He saved our lives.
I have need of friends.
What else is left for a man without friends.
How did you know I had sons?
I know you.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
That I promise you.
Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
Not sleepy, either?
No.
We must try to get horses.
A flicker of talent.
Yes, my lord.
Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
Would you settle for a boar?
We'll meet you at the inn.
Can't I come, too?
No.
Sugarballs?
No.
You do?
You can have half.
Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
I only want one.
A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
No, no. I'm with you, boy.
Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!
You had better manners as a pig.
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
And do you think I live on air?
We have plenty of hares.
Oh, my poor stomach.
Look at its insides.
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
No. He will master the leader.
Then he will die!
He will not come. You will be my queen.
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
That I am, my lady.
A match for your son, I think.
A fine match.
Yes. We lost five.
You were lucky. I lost thirty there.
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
With an old voice?
I will seek the Fortress for you.
Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.
There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
Yes.
She has the power to kill.
She had another name once.
Fewer will survive them.
It is not necessary. They will not follow.
Ynyr!
The most beautiful woman in the world.
But you would not stay with me.
She bore you many children?
We had no children.
You had a son.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
It is no trickery.
Yes.
Why do you want to know?
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
...Office 2702.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
...Good...  But what's special in him?
Yeah.
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Well, I don't need them...
Good.
130... 140...
Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
Now, try a running guy.
OK.
You were scared, weren't you?
Yes.
No, you can't go out.
Why?
Too heavy.
Mathilda, stop, please!
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
I think.
A little...
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!
Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
...Don't you like me?
...I don't know.
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Three times, then two times.
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
I have no fear.
Fine...
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
Huh, that's good!
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
...No... he's my lover...
Huh? Why?
Ten dollars... A month.
Huh... Yeah, yeah... Of course.
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
No... Dino's.
...Even his mother wouldn't.
Where?
Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
Why am I such an authority?
Here comes the resume.
I don't accept that.
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
I'll make it.
Maybe later.
I won't let you die.
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
You need a ride, Preacher?
Pardon?
You do?
I've seen it before.
You have?
There was no card.
It's just a regular day.
The new store?
We can do it together.
I don't follow.
Anything?
Why do you polish it?
Then why?
There's no reason.
I will -- I promise.
You like to take walks?
I've changed my mind.
You can't change your mind.
You've just decided, is that right?
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases.
He's plastered.
That's okay -- really it is.
Pacifica, California.
Yes.
Good.
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
Pacifica, California.
From where?
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
I see.
About my love for her.
Jumped where?
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
Making the grand total?
Perhaps there's another route?
Mammoth.
The Gazette's small huh?
Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
Where?
Tomorrow.
Walking where?
California.
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
Oh, a coastal city.  That's good.
She wasn't certain... I never really showed her.
So I've been informed.
She never ate a slice.
... The Grapes of Wrath.
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
Saluting.
In a hospital.
Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
I need your help.
Good morning.
Oh, that's not mine.
Hello.
How are you feeling?
What?  Who are you?
This isn't right.
What do you want?
What are my choices?
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
...Noooo.
Orange soda?
No.
Coffee?
No.
Sparkling apple cider?
No.
Water?
Water?
Hello.
Are you working?
No, this is fine. I was just wondering.
You what?
I sometimes fade out.
You were going to get my door.
Of course.
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
OK... whatever.
Yes, that's right.
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
Yeah. And your meter just ran out.
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
You OK out there?
Yes. Take your time. I'm fine.
Thank you. What time is it?
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
Don't be silly?
Sorry.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
I don't understand any of that.
Can we just ignore it?
Yes... I'll give you that.
Thank you, Sera.
No... we already talked about that.
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
Let's stay for a while.
OK.
Yes... I guess I knew that.
I don't know. I'll find out though.
Do I look that obvious? My name's Paul.
Where are you staying?
Right here at the hotel. Why?
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
I am lonely, Yuri.
With an old friend.
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
All of it. I need to buy many things... all of it!
It's me, Yuri.
Sera... please go.
That's right.
But it's a top three school --
I can't tell you.
You understand you're on trial for murder?
I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.
Go to hell.
I'll take that as a no.
Are we done for today?
I believe we are.
What?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
He's an ass that's gonna try.
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
That's not what's important.
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
He means well. He's really brilliant and all.
Who could better understand than me?
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
His dead body with a bullet in it.
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
No, she'd stashed it by then.
No. I was in the shower.
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
Who's askin'?
I'm Elle Woods. Ms. Bonafante's attorney.
Tell him, Paulette.
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
Thank you!
Is everything okay?
About the alibi --
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
So everything you just said --
I'm a man who knows what I want.
Yes, I am.
No, she was crying her eyes out.
What?
See?
Aristotle.
How about --
I don't know.
Spill.
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
Is she as pretty as you?
No.
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
Which must be a nice vacation for his balls...
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
How'd it go at the trial?
Licensed attorney or family member?
Uh -- family.
Relation?
I'm her sister.
Name?
Delta. Gamma.
You know her?
Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
I'm still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi.
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
I know. He has it sent out.
What?
Yes, you are.
Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming...
Thank you. I love you, too.
I have the highest GPA in Delta Gamma!
Your scrunchie?
Picking out my wedding dress!
What?!
Josh proposed!
No way --
Not yet.
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
Did she do that to you, too?
Thanks again for your help!
I wasn't gonna --
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
She's completely untrustworthy.
Why?
But maybe it's not what you think.
But maybe it is --
No, she can't move for an hour.
We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --
Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
That's not really a topic that keeps me up at night -- but maybe it should.
Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
For a butt-head? Yes.
What?!
Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.
I'm quitting.
Oh, my God!!
What do you think?
I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
I just don't understand what went wrong --
What, like on va-kay?
I got bangs!
Really --
I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!
Why not?
I don't know --
You should. Do you have a resume?
Maybe she found him like that.
Of course, I do!
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
Uh, no. Maybe you should try the Lido deck.
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
So are you!
Then what? My boobs are too big?
Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
Harvard. Law school.
You got into Harvard Law?
What, like it's that hard?
Do anything exciting?
Thank you. Having fun?
Now I am.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
I just don't want to see you get your hopes up. You know how you get.
Thank you.
See?
Are you serious?
Huh. Imagine that. Looks like I am.
Where?
And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
And what is your boyfriend's name?
Why do you say that?
Haven't you seen the cabana boy?
Where's the Rock?
It's not a Theta --
Pull up next to him!
Faith.
Anything left for smashing you may happily smash.
I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
Purely a precaution...
Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
To finish last evening's delightful work.
What do you want with me?
Your love.
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
You're magnificent.
Grotesque... monstrous...
Not from me, surely...
You... you're a beast!
I am afraid of nothing.
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
Do you feed on mice and rats?
To be my bride, of course.
What do you want from me?
At the moment, very little.  Your company at my table...
Yes?
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
It's terrible.
To be sure.
What!
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
Well spoke.  True to the mark.  And if it's wine you're wanting, it's wine we shall have.
I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Big question that, lad.  Why what?
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
No less a creature than the Lindfarne Worm.
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
Something's coming.
It would appear so.
Aye!  That too.
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
Whatever for?
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
Blackheart?
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
What know you of fields of war?
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
Something the matter?
Ogg's footprints!
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
Going grows slower... we've not made... half a mile in two hours...
There's the way, mates.
It bodes evil.
Willful creature, that one...
Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
Aye, lad... we've little else to go by.
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Nay.  This time we strike first!
I know the rogue, Jack.  Tis Jimmy Squarefoot.
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
No... but what choice have we?
The chill is worse this night.
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
Why not mine the damned walls?
Been telling you that all along, lad.
What magic have we on our side?
That's it!
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
Fire away!
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
Aye.  We're good as inside.
It's what we'll find there worries me.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Mean you to seek him out below?
I'm not afraid of the dark.
Sunlight.
Patience, lad.
He'll not escape me.
You're on your own... like a true champion.
I've not heard a note out of you.
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
Where?
Go on... go on...
No, no, no... this is different!
Gonna make ogre-stew!
Three cheers for our champion.
Very thrifty.  Even got your arrow back.
They've fired the moat!
They'll do nicely.
Sorry.
Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
If you like.
Never.
But you did... you did!
I may have said perhaps...
Or perchance...
Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
A gentleman would offer water.
Be patient.
What's the matter?
Shhh!
In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches.
They rival the angels of paradise.
Jack!
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
To fetch your napkin.
My father and the Baron.
My own father...
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
Its powers are strong.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
I have no wife.
Then, perchance you'll me.
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
What if I answer yes?  Will my wish come true?
Jack... Forgive me...
Only what's right...
I was bewitched... it's better this way...
They told me you were dead.
You've freed me, Jack...
Sunlight... It destroys him.
Sunlight?
So, he's hiding in the dark...
In the dark... where I join him...
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
And I love you, my husband.
Biting you?
Pinching?  Where?
Everywhere!  Ow!
I can't see a thing.
His feet shall never cross my lips.
Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
Why then, there thou hast.  We be lucky worse has not befallen us.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
What became of the princess?
Princess?  I know of no princess.
As fair as me?
No!
I don't believe you.
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
I pray God grants it me.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
Only that?
And charmed, of course.
Do I not please you, Jack?
In every way.
And am I not fair?
Wondrously so.
Jest with me then.
How so?
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
I'm promised to another!
You... you... you mortal you!
Please...
We wait.
I think she's about to foal.
Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
Small miracles better than no miracles...
Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
It's done... we'll never catch him.
I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
You're well equipped, I'd say. Legendary arms...
May God protect you.
I'm sending you back to Hell!
To Castle Couer de Noir?
In a dream.
What are you doing?
I'm not cheating!  I'm not looking!
I thought I might stop by.
He's here.  Check the bathroom.
I checked everywhere.  He's not there.
Mom said I should.
Oh.
I would have anyway.
I don't think Dad wants you home.
Who are you?
What color?
Red.
Here, honey!
What's wrong?
And why was the alarm on?
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
Oh God, we don't want the police!
I couldn't sleep last night.
Uh...using Josh like that.
Has he eaten anything at all?
Who are all these people?
I'll survive.
He seems lonely.
Are you his friend?
No.
Why?
I'm living here while I build another house.
Nope.
Monday.
What's that?
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
I want you to try something with me, okay?
Let's shut up and not kill her.
What did you think it would be?
I don't know...  More like when I kissed Sam.
What are you doing here?
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Where's your dad?
He jumped into the ocean.
Tell him I said "hi".
You look better without make-up.
I can't even take a shower here.
I'll get your back.
No.  That's okay.
Turn over.
I can use your mom's.
I'm okay.
He can peddle over anytime he wants to for it.
I don't want you to!
We're not gonna do anything.
Why are you so stupid?
Why are you so uptight?
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
Does everything have to have a point?
Josh said...
I'm not gay.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
Are you afraid of heights?
Not if what he left me was real.
Floating to Catalina.
What?
He's got a standing invitation.
He's at work while I'm here.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
Will he talk to me?
It could have been a squirt gun.
You've been good this week.
We've known each other since grade school.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
I've been dreading you.
Oh, yes.
And if I enclosed it?
An exhaust system or a window is code.
Allowed outside the enclosed area.
I flushed it down the toilet.
If that's what it takes.
Months.
What are you on?
Pardon me?
how much weight have you lost?
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
He buys and sells the world.
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
Maybe that's too long.
Maybe...?
That's too long.
How old are you?
Forty.
I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.
I hate this job.
From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
Good.  I was hoping for that.
What can I do for you, George?
Yes, it is.
She's out with a friend.
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
She didn't really say.
Oh...okay.
Uh huh.
I didn't recognize you!
I'm sorry.
I want you both to stay.
Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
You're here early today.
We're getting out of the ground today.
It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
George, this is the third time.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
And you thought they might be under her dress?
I don't know.
You don't know what the deal is.  There is no fucking deal.
To check up on me?
Because I live there.
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
You'll know me by the time we're through.
I'll get your bag.
You don't have a choice.
Mom...please.
I almost saw Catalina.
Goodnight.
I warned you yesterday.
Don't touch me!  You can't touch me!
No you don't.
It bugs me.
You'll have money when you work.
You're so predictable.
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
I'm not doing it!
It'll be fine.
Hey...hey!
I don't know.
When are you going to be back?
I don't know.
Well, until you know, you can't go.
A friend of yours is here.
Did you got through my pants?
I might have a solution.
The gloves on the table are for you.
You can't make me do a thing.
Sit down for a second.
No.
Hi, Mom.
I know.  Why?
How do you become something you're not?
What would you like to be?
What I'm not.
Nothing.
That's not true.
I know parts of who you are.
What do you know about me?
I'm telling you now.
Getting high, I guess.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
I'm proud of you, Sam.
To hide a black eye.
Why wouldn't she leave?
After everything he did to you and your mom?
What's wrong with your back?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I still don't know what that means.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I still don't know what that means.
Yes.
Here.
Good for you.
I'd build a house.
You know what mortise and tenon is?
I can die trying.
I haven't been touched in years.
Left you this place.
At least your father tried, George.
I know there's an explanation.
God, you look like crap, George.
I want you to find someone for me.
It's okay.
Because Dad left?
I don't even care if he ever comes back.
Ring the bell before you try the door.
Where is he?
Where he always is.
He doesn't answer.
Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today.
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
Where have you been for a week?!
What did you do with your dog?
Kurt's been feeding him.
But you can't call me while you think?
Why would they tow your truck?
I was parked in day parking.
Why call me?
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
Where will you live?
The garage.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
Not for the weekend.  For the summer.
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
One of you would end up dead.
At least we'll have a house to show for it.
I want him with me.
No, you don't.  Trust me.
I'm married.
I drove over and you were gone.
I can't leave the house?
Last time you were gone for a week!
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
No.  I was going to let you do that.
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
Let's go.
Well, for later then.
I used to live here.
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
The first and the last.
I dreamed about your house last night.
Finished or unfinished?
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
You're not well.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
I think so.
This was my very first slow dance.
Watch out for the smile, boys.
Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
I can hire workers to help me.
You've never said that before.
I can't pick you up.
You bit my finger.
If I weren't married?
I didn't think you'd come today.
Left you?
'I'll be in the bedroom.'
What?
So could I.
It's not my back that's killing me.
Not a perfect day.
No.
Does Alyssa know?
Nothing.
You got any weed?
You got the money?
Don't even...I'm there.
Who?
A man he respects.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
It would worry me.
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
We should take a vacation.
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
You can't go because of Sam?
I know.
What are you doing home?
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
Despite you.
I never asked for more.
That's the problem.
Please don't leave me.
Sam took them to a movie.
Either do you.
Hey.
You got a dog?
It's not ours.  It's George's.
Why?
I didn't go in your room.
Depends on what I'd give up on.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it.
This is what he wants.
What did you say?
Can we really help build a house?
Yes, it is.
Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy!
Dad's home, already?
In the bedroom.
No, nigger.
Nigger.
That's my girl.
Better make it a week.
She's doing just fine.
And the baby?
He's a big one.
I'm talking about a haircut.
Not for me, it ain't.
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
No, but...
Then what's the problem?
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
She got married last month.
Married?
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
Want me to come back some other time?
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
Yes, sir.
Goodnight, Claude.
He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
Here!
I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
But I'm having a good time...
That's because I've never been here before.
I'm Sylvia. What's your name?
I know it begins with a "C"...
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
He looks like he can take care of himself.
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
Why would you want to go home? It's so early.
I don't think so.
Sure I do. What's your name again?
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
A thumb? What do you mean, like cut it off? For ten bucks?  That include the tip?
Nothing.
That's right, a loan officer.
You need collateral.
Like this?
My daddy gave me this watch.
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
I must have left my appetite outside, which is where I think we ought to be right now.
What'd you say?
Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
Yeah, I want some pie.
What gave you that idea?
Here I am.
Guess we better get going, huh?
Still got that ten dollars?
He's dead.
What ain't there?
Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.
Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
You know what I'm saying.
Forget it.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
I'm sure it don't.
Claude.
What do you want, Claude?
You still got that map?
Yeah.
I said you're soft.
New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
Let me take a look at that map.
You drew this?!
I'm stuck!
I'm serious, man. Don't mention it. Ever.
We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred and Sixty First Street.
I don't know. Who do you want?
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
Of course, he's in the lineup. There he goes right there. Hey, Babe...!
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
Let me see that.
Make 'em throw strikes.
Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
Well, if that's the way it is...
That's the way it is.
Then I have nothing left to say to you.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
That was five years ago.
Bullets weren't the problem. That pie was too hot. Burned my tongue.
Don't touch that car.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
Back to New York for starters.
No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
What'd you say?
I said you're soft.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
Why the hell not?
Gimme that damn thing.
Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
They're touching.
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
I'm sorry, he's on medication...
I'm all right.
You ever done time before?
I try to moisturize regularly.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
Made just for you, Cookie.
How about some steak sauce?
No problem. Oh, boy!
Why ain't that pick swinging?
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
State of Mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. You got that?!
Move it out.
My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
Of course nobody believed Ray and Claude.
Rayford!
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
It'll be too late.
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
I prefer bourbon.
Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
Why, my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back.
She give you that scar, too?
Like you shot Winston Hancock?
No, it says Marleen here.
Anybody else need anything read?
Greenville, that the nearest town?
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
Me? Willie Long.
What are you in for, Willie?
That's a long story...
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
You found him.
Blacks welcome there?
Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
You shouldn't have come here.
Please, get out of my mind!
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
I hear a train coming. Drink.
Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
It's just such a slap in the face.
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
What do you think about... Earth?
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
It's our time, brother.
Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
All right. Let me out.
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
Don't do it!
Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
I'm calling you out, brother...
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
My mom wasn't a goat?
Try an angel.
Angels don't get any older, son.
She's so nice.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
Oh. Sorry.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
What can I do about it?
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
Everything's fine, pop.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
Yes, Jimmy.
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
I was just playing with you.
And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
How bad?
I'm too weak. The process has already begun.
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
That's what I'm thinkin'...
That's a pretty brassiere.
Thanks.
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Beast.
Boogerland!
Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
Oh, would you grow up.
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
Yeah. You do it.
The Dark Prince is here.
Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
We know where to find Nicky.
Peppermint... alright.
That way.
Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
So I followed him...
You followed him?
I was DeNiro!
All right...
Dude, it's us. Let us in.
Dude. Seriously?
I'll just go to Heaven.
You smell like coconuts.
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
Really?
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
Uh, it's a deep south expression.
Good. I was concerned.
What was that?
Are you dead?
No.
I think I'm floating.
Why would you be floating?
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
East Rutherford.
I have to, Valerie.
That was Cassius!
From my dad's side of the family.
I love you.
I love you.
I don't know.
And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
Yes. I would like my flask back.
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
Your turn.
From? From? From?
Where do you send them?
You're a beautiful pair.
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
It'll be all right...
Up there.
Your own work?
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
Just wondered... what happens?
Well... you can't have them all.
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
Only a few? You're just not trying.
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
Did you ever see anybody renew?
Anybody we know?
At Carousel tonight?
It has nothing to do with you.
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
I'm Mary 2.
Where do you live, Mary?
Here.
Why aren't you in Nursery?
I'm very smart.
When do you go up?
I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
You prefer women?
No.
Well then...?
He was killed.
Killed? Why do you use that word?
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
No.
Later.
No.
I thought I had to do something.
Curious.
About what?
How a Sandman lives.
I'm listening.
I'm afraid to tell you.
I'm not armed.  Well?
Why is it wrong to run?
So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
Are you a 5 or a 6? 
Six. I go red next year.
Here I am.  Shall I come in?
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
Thanks... but I have the choice.
Of course.
Then it's still no.
I'm going to run.
Why tell me?
You know something.
About running, dying what?
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
How can I?
A Runner gave it to me.
And then you killed him, right?
I let him go... believe me.
I don't..
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
And I never heard of Sanctuary.
What do you need?
That's tomorrow.
Maybe you'll think of something...
I wish I knew what you think I know.
If you trusted me, you'd know.
We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?
You're not going, are you?
That's nice.
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
I have.
But what is this -- why?
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
We'll be all right...  We will...
Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
Don't ever let go.
I won't.
Do you think he was telling the Truth?
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
...But I still have the choice...?
Of course.
Then the answer's yes...
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
One in a million, I suppose
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
To what?
And Sanctuary?
Beloved wife...
Are you sure?
Mother and Father said so... you know?
I don't know.
All this. All of it.
What people?
I don't know... but it does.
At least it's over...
We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
Where are you going?
Oh, my...
Hello.
For as long as I can remember.
What kind of place is this?
Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
I have always been here...
Are there any other humans?
Gracious... no.
What makes you think so?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
Dead... they're dead... and buried.
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
No, no, no
Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.
All right.
And all alive you say?
I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.
Oh, yes... I think...
Can you make it back?
Oh my... I'll try.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
I don't think so.
Good... You up for a drive?
Sheila'll be at "Tops".
Sure, what's wrong with that?
Okay.
Listen.
No, I'm okay.
They're comin' with us.
Pile in.
What?
You okay?... What's wrong?
Yeah.
Yes, I thought my wife...
What do you mean by that?
How I remember them. Not necessarily the way they happened.
What is?
No. Fred hates them.
Maid? Relative?
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Right... This just glided along.
Anybody else have a key to the house.
As best we can.
If anything else happens, you'll call us.
Yeah... Laurent.
His or ours?
Ours, Ed.
You know what I think?
What's that, Ed?
Yeah, I remember.
Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner.
Me, too.
Can I call you?
It's me...
Hi.
Me, too.
I'll call you again.
Are you positive he knows?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
So what do we do?
I don't know.
We should stop seeing each other.
No... no.
I used to.
He works for Mr. Eddy.
What's he do?
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
How'd it happen, Alice?
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
Yes.
Alice, I...
We killed him.
You killed him.
Alice?
Up the stairs - down the hall.
Yes, I believe so.
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Sit down a minute.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
The police called us.
Yeah? what did they want?
No.
Yes.
His physical condition.
Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
Out in back.
You talk to him?
No... Here he comes.
You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
Did you ask him who he is?
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
What's the word on the street?
We'll get a tail put on him.
No, sir, it's not.
Who is it?
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
Yeah, Mack?
He didn't come home.
Pete, what happened to you?
No... I don't. Why?
Nothin'.
Who was the man?
He won't give his name.
I don't know yet.
I... I didn't say anything...
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
The first night... Not the last two.
My... My head.
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
What do you mean? You're where right now?
That's absurd.
Alice who?
What are you going to do?
I thought I'd stay home and read.
That's why I married you.
Wake me up when you get home.
A videotape.
Who's it from?
Same one you were reading the other night?
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
Called? When?
I guess so.
All right.
Two detectives are coming out.
Thanks, guys.
I wish I knew.
What?
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
He's got some fucked up friends.
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
No... of course not.
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
It's okay with Arnie... Come on, let's go.
All right!
Pornos?
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
You're my man, Pete.
Okay.
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
Who is this?
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
Okay.
I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
No. No, I don't.
We just killed a couple of people...
Yeah?...
Yeah.
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
Sure.
Sorry... I...
Last time I saw you.
I don't remember... What happened that night?
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
Sure. Sure I do.
You really don't remember?
No... I told you.
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
I don't want to talk about it...
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
Come on... get in.
Yeah.
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
What's the BITCH'S name?!
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Go home, Sheila.
FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
Oh, read it!
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
I'm a paleontologist.
A what?
A paleontologist.
Oh, I see.
Found in Asia!
Uh-huh.
Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
Don't call me brother.
Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
I beg your pardon.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
Good morning
I see.
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
I'm never conversational before I coffee.
It certainly is.
Look here
Yes.
Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?
Do you think they're cannibals?
I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
Please don't call me Lovey.
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
Yes.
Horns? What kind of horns?
And be poisoned out here in the open?
This doesn't obligate me in any way.
They were in a quandary, and
Come on, Lovey.
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village
Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
Say, what about that gold deal?
Gold. You were going to
Nothing. Why?
Why, you look beautiful.
Over by that hill.
Look, Bob!
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business
So there are others?
Oh, yes.
Who, for instance?
There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
Well, it must have taken
Centuries.
You're startled?
I surprise you? Now that's news.
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Shall we have another?
No thanks. Not tonight if you don't mind.
Yes, charming.
Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Please let me help you.
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
No.
Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
Then it's done.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
Thank you.
As far away as I ever want to be.
Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.
What is it, my son?
Oh, the girl at the piano?
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Hello? Colonel?
Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That will make light for them!
Come on! Quick! This way.
I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
Dead?
See that spot?
Yes.
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
I don't know.
That's what you said.
Well - I mean
Porters?
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
Let me go, Bob!
Chang! Chang! Chang!
All right. Sorry, George.
Porters?
Why - I'm sorry - but I
Why not? What's going to stop me?
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned
Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
Yes, the little Russian girl.
What's she got to do with it?
She's going with me.
The clothes?
Yes, everything!
What about the others?
was saying
There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
Why aren't you registered through our office?
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
What if he refuses?
Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
In for what?
We'd be eternally grateful if you
hope you'll forgive me for
A man whose life was empty!
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
Why?
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
English!
We didn't get much information out of him, did we Bob?
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
Yes.  Barney!
Please don't go.
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
Thank you.
Hesitated, sir.
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
The hell were you thinking?
It's not even a fucking door.
What the hell...
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
I guess I lost:
You got smeared.
And Goodwill Toward Man?
No. just peace on Earth.
I gotta be honest about something.
For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
We're the government, Cowan.
What happens if I say no?
I'd go with number three.
What?  I thought you just--
Yup.  Sure is.
INS, Washington.  Special services.
Sir--
I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
I know, but we're on a college campus...
This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
Ha ha.  No, really.
It was a long time ago.-
Um-- Kay?
Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD.  Jay winces.
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
A what?
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
Gee.  You really think?
And what's this ... ?
What?
Where to?
I think that's what's happening...
Get back in the car!
We're rising.
The Pentagon.
What if he's telling the truth?
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
All of it?
I'd double it and add 20.
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
in case I need it?
Kay!?
Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
You coulda told me what you were doing.
There wasn't time, sport!
Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.
Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
Yeah, right.  Even I can barely read all my work.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
Do have any idea what I just said?
Well, first of all, it's entomologist.
Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
What do we do?    Lean into it.
Actually... I don't know.
They respond to fear, right?
Yeah ... ?
You figured what?
Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
You're not taking me in!
Did he say where?
Actually, yeah--
How'd you know that?  Kay?
Cause I think we're looking at it.
But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before.
Wait-- listen--
Fine.  Good.
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
Dee?  What are you doing here?
What do we have?  Are we showing anything?
They went right to the President.
Did it leave?
Actually, I don't know...
Oh shit!
Can you see?
What?
They're inside.
Who?
Agatha...
Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.
He'll turn around.
He won't.
Wait.
Anderton, leave.
What is it?
Someplace safe.
I have to go back.
Why?
I am going back.  I see myself there.
Who wanted her little girl back?
She grew up.
She's still alive?
RUN!
Just some guy... they found.
Somewhere.
Because I found out about her...
About who?
Anne Lively...
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
It's all I could safely move.
We know each other?
Yes, you did.
You made those tapes...
Here --
I can't even stand up --
Drowning.
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
For that, we have to go for a ride.
... Graveyard shift.
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
Don't worry, Lamar.
The nation votes this week...
Don't apologize, John.
Tuck in your shirt.
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
What?
In the middle of the night?
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
And who the hell is that?
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
I'm not getting halo'd.
You can't run --
Everybody runs.
Beauty?  The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
Then go ahead, pull the trigger.
You're kidding, that's today?
You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
The mall?
Now look at him...
Did he close the front door?
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
Any ID on the shooter yet?
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
Because it was going to fall.
Yes.
Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
Really?  You've never been inside?
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
If it's a question of authority.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
But you call this room the "temple".
Just a nickname.
You gonna tell on me?
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
Do I know you?  Who are you?
Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
Well, hello there, honey-pie.
That's right.
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
Then take her to Radio Shack.
Tell me how.
I guess that's all of it.
Uh, I'll try...
That's great.
I love you, too!  I love you daddy.  Love ya, dad.
All right, I'll try...
You gotta have faith, Dad.
It's a little late for that.
Wanna hear something funny?
What the hell.
No.  He got tired of pretending.
Oh, Sean --
Good-bye, Dad...
I'm your son.  I'm you.
Sean, wait...
Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
Some -- somebody's father?
I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
No.
The precogs were wrong.
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
Who made you do this?
Kill me!
Tell me!
You're not gonna kill me...
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
And how would I know that?
You're talking about the precogs...
And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
So you won't help me?
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
I believe in that system...
Do you?  Really?
Hold that thought.
Why should I trust you?
The safest place of all.
-- and then walk out.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
The female.
He's dead, Lara.
Oh, God, what did you do?
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
Then how did he --
I thought you were retiring?
He also said Crow was a fake.
Tell him not now.
I'll be right there.
My God...
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
Wait, just a second...
Not quite.
Get the hell outta here.  You sick bastard.
Nice to meet you.  Gum?
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
Because he thinks he's innocent.
We can stop him.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
I don't know, why?
What kind of cop were you before this?
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
None.  This was arranged.
Who?
I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
Sure.  Raincheck.
I forgot my glasses.
I know who you are.
Yes.
Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
Cream and sugar.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
We used to, every summer.
He's not here now, is he?
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
That was our apartment.
Have you been there recently?
You mean after he lost your son.
But John was with him at the pool?
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
Tell me how all this works.
What does he want with a precog?
Yeah.
You sure? I just made it.
No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks.
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
When served warm --
Then put my Martel's in a snifter.
Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
Is it a good room?
I can take you down there.
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Are you sure?
Yeah. Take it.
Thank you very much, sir.
So?
What, sir?
Is it the good room?
All the suites are about the same.
What if I gave you forty?
Thank you, sir.
Where's the place to go tonight?
As far as...?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
Women?
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
Manhattan.
So you're models?
He's okay.
Should I fuck him?
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
He's great, right. Is he great?
He's alright.
I know.
We used to take baths together.
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
She's, uh, sleeping.
It's daytime.
He's not doing it.
Chloe?
Uncle Bobby?
Mommy's not home?
No.
What time is it there?
Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.
Where were you?
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
No. What kind of bachelor party?
The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
I'm ready.
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
Go.
With what?
Max offered to stake me.
Don't get my hopes up. If I quit, what then? I can't go through this again.
How could you let her see this?
What'd you say?
There's no touching.
But what about them?
I don't get it.
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
Well, you look it. You win?
5-5-1.
You driving her?
Yeah.
Get away from her.
Excuse --
Yeah. Where is he?
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
Brooklyn.
Yeah?
Quick drop. In and out.
Where's Ricky?
Ricky's taken care of.
How so?
That's it.
Where's Ricky.
Sure. Yeah.
You bet the ponies?
Me? No. Not really.
A million. Easy.
She was fast, huh?
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
Not driving Jess, you won't.
What?
I didn't say that.
Then what are you saying?
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
You told him you liked him.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
You vouch for him?
What is it?
You want --
Take a few days --
Bobby.
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
Traveling light. I like that.
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
You don't know where you're going?
No. Just the cross streets.
Well, this is the corner.
No. That's cool, man.
Yeah.
Depends what night.
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
Understand me?
Yeah.
Ricky's taken care of.
Taken care of?
Yeah, he's getting there on his own.
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
I'm on the phone.
It's important.
I be off in a minute.  Say again...?
Ruiz isn't here.
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
He's not here.
Any time, bro.
Thanks.
What about boxing?
What about it?
What are you saying?
So, it was a draw.
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
So, it's not a winning record.
It's not losing record.
How am I being shitty?
Don't be shitty.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
Ask if he said anything to her.
I'll page you with the number.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
Then why do you try to get in?
Shhh...
We don't need guns.
I think we might.
He didn't say we need guns.
He implied it.
I'll beat your ass --
Sorry coach.
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
It's not even yours.
I like it.
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
I don't know.
This paint sucks. The white shows through.
Is that the woman from..?
She really liked the kitchen.
To keep?
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
No. Look. There.
You sure?
C'mon, man...
Forty-six.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Yeah, I guess.
Great. On my fucking room.
Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.
What are you doing?
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
Well, I don't want to walk.
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
They didn't say an address?
I told you what they said.
Nothing else.
Nothing.
They asked who it was.
So they said more than the address.
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
What the fuck do you...
Motherfucker...
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
What the fuck is that supposed --
I mean, that's what I heard --
You got something to say --
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
Yeah. What vibe?
Like I said, I don't know.
He woulda told us right?
You would think.
So we're working?
About what?
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
Back in.
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
She was jonesing for me.
He wants to see us now.
We're not getting whacked.
It's not a 'sit down.' He said he's telling us the plan.
C'mon, man...
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
Yeah. Where they gonna whack us?
You want us strapped, don't you?
I'm your soldier.
The what?
The penguin house.
Did you hear what he just said?
I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
We don't need guns.
I'm pretty sure we do.
Why?
No.
What do you have left?
Eighty.
Eighty bucks?!?
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
It's gonna be fine.
No more, man.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
Three and a half hours?
I don't want to take any more chances.
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
I'll be a minute.
Tom. How's it going?
Fine, fine. And you were...?
Bobby and Ricky.
Right, right. The 'thugs.'
Fuck...
And you grew up in Manhattan?
What do you mean 'kinda?'
That's a good idea, maybe I will!
You want your surprise?
Yeah. I want it.
Well, come on then. It's back here.
How is it you're good? You on a list?
What?
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
You look good, man.
Cool. See you later.
Cool.
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
How much is what?
The videos.
Drinks are free, right?
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
Where do you live?
Excuse me.
Where do you live?
'Strapped?'
Why? What I say bad?
What? Why am I bad?
You really in trouble?
Stop.
Watch it...
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
No?
Pity. What's say we have a drink?
Does anyone want another?
You want another drink?
I hear the China Club is a laugh.
A little Charlie, perhaps.
Coke?
No, really, mate?
Here...
How's it going?
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
Nah, man...
Yeah.
You're from LA, right?
Yeah.
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
You know my pager number?
No. What is it?
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
Different.
Four fernet.
You rode?
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
That money is your per diem.
And where do we bring it?
What?
What about my keys?
Tell me.
Don't worry. I get it.
So tell me how it is.
You want... Why are you picking on me?
We're square.
Yes, sir.
What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
Outfit? What's he talking about?
What?
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
And where might that be?
Scotland.
Bet you like that shit.
Keeps me out of the army.
When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
Where I come from. Boston.
How 'bout that?
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
I like you, country.
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
Lemme write it down for you.
Yes, sir.
Why?
Just now.
Solid, daddy.
Nnnnnnn!
I'll take your goddam bet.
What you talking?
You owe me six big ones.
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
The bitch was there.
I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
You know it.
I'll give you back the 600.
I don't want your money.
I'm wearing, Archie.
That's what it is. Walk on out.
Let Billie finish.
Now.
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
Man, what do you want?
Man, get outa my face. I ain't nobody's punk.
I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
What did you give it to me for then?
'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
Don't con me. Don't try...
Okay, okay.
What do you do with your time?
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
Where am I gonna start?
-- the hardest and the greatest.
I can't.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
I don't know how.
I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty.
She ate.
You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad.
Delicious.
There's nothing to talk about.
Just an idle question.
If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
What have you set your mind to?
Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good wife.
I know.
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
Yes. Did you eat?
I love you.
Just hold me.
It will be rough.
Hush your mouth.
I'll be away a lot.
You're with me even when you're away.
How do you know?
The talk is everywhere!
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
What do you want me to do?
You have to sleep for three.
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
That's enough, Brother Earl.
Let some of us come down there.
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
Is my family here yet?
Down front as always.
Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
I don't think we know for certain.
That's right.
What color were the original Hebrews?
I told you we don't know for certain.
Then we don't know that God was white.
Yes, sir, I did.
Sure, man.
What?
"His greatest greatness."
And like a fool I believe it.
If she got eyes, she do.
Burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years...
The sentences to run concurrently.
Now you come back.
I ain't stupid.
I mean it's late, baby.
I know where you're going.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
Your control over your children, therefore --
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation.
Please make way, please --
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
No. You'll be marked for death.
Let me die then.
...That isn't a whore?
You better believe it.
What's your story, baby?
Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Well, all reet, then.
Shorty, this is Laura.
Fine as May wine.
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
I'm not too short to be Cagney.
I ain't doing bad.
Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this.
Tell him about Baldy.
Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
Might be all right.
Head nigger in charge?
I'm the man.
Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
Eddie, let's see that blotter.
Are you sure?
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
They talked about me like
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
No. It would be convenient, but no.
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
[South America.]
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
[I'm on to Juarez.]
[Why?]
[I have a friend there.]
I guess that makes you the smart one.
We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.
So where do we begin?
I'll call you tomorrow.
Where?
[Daniel.]
[Daniel what?]
[Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.]
[The what?]
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[Who killed her? You?]
[Don't lie to me.]
[The boss did or his brother.]
[Who's the boss?]
[Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[You are Jorge Ramirez.]
[Who are you?]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
[Where do I find him?]
[I don't know. No one knows.]
[I believe you.]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[One-one-three Arco Iris. Third floor.]
[I want you.]
[I told you, non-negotiable.]
[Her life for your life.]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[You stole the drop.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
[The ransom was ten.]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
[His lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.]
Show me, please.
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
I'm here.
What do you mean, I'm here?
Nothing wrong.
Don't give me that bullshit.
Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
I came to visit you.
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
Sorry I woke you, Ray.
I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.
If they like me.
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Creasy...
The United States.
I know. But which state?
Why not?
I'm looking for potential.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
That's right.
No.
Not at all?
No.
But why not?
I'm not crying.
Do you think he'll come back?
Well, I let him go.
Yes. Actually, he was driving me crazy.
They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
Where?
Everywhere!
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
Yes.
You need to practice.
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
You feel sorry for the husband?
Don't worry. You will.
I guess that really does make me a hard case.
Did you used to?
Yeah. Two or three.
I'm sorry.
I dropped her at home.
I know you're not.
Are you afraid of me?
The gunshot holds no fear.
There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
Your father has business.
Could I stop you?
You don't drink like you used to.
That's not a question.
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
So are you.
The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
Because...  I was already dead.
Planned what?
It's Creasy.
Where are you?
What was her name?
For an American she understands this country very well.
[Yes.]
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
I'm trying, mom.
You do?
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
Hmm?
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
What? Who?
Creasy.
It's not.
He has to go.
She's young. She'll get over it.
I wasn't thinking of Pinta.
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
[I should start going for your tits first.]
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
You helped him get this job.
That's what friends do.
What happened to him? What happened to Creasy?
What?
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
I could see she likes you.
Yeah, sure.
I'll call her up.
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
I think this number is a little fast. Wait a minute.
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
You want me to ride down with you?
It's early.
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
Where you going?
She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
I came to see you. How you feel?
That's nice.
I don't think I remember him.
Well, he died. You know who else died?
That's my son Thomas's baby.
Well, it ain't your baby.
She gave me the evil eye.
When was this?
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
What they say?
I know it pains.
Marty.
Benjamin Franklin High School.
Yes, I know.
Come on inna dining room.
Sure. Just take off your coat a minute.
Maybe that would be a good idea.
Please...
No...
Please...
Marty...
Nothing.
Nothing.
We just live one flight up.
So I'll call you tomorrow.
Okay.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
Well, siddown a minute. I just come inna house. I'll take off my coat. Siddown a minute.
No, I'm not kidding.
Where you going now?
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
Oh, that's a sad story.
About eight o'clock.
Sure, great if you ain't married.
No, I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.
You gotta good heart.
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
You gonna die without a son.
So I'll die without a son.
Put on your blue suit...
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
Ma! Leave me alone!
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
Might as well siddown a minute, Clara.
I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
I don't know. I don't think so.
Don't bring her to the house no more.
What didn't you like about her?
You want a beer, Ang'?
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
You still owe me ten bucks from last week, if that's what you're working up to.
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.
Hello, Thomas.
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
That's all right, that's all right...
On accounta...
I'm gonna see you tonight...
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
Virginia, I don't wanna hear no more about it!
Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
She don't wanna use my pots and pans!
He's parted his moorings.
I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
They give you copies to burn.
How you, Radar?
Where?
Hospital.
Which hospital?
Back home.
He said it for us all, Walt.
Look at that right eye.
You really think we hurt him that bad?
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
What the hell's going on here?
Same general idea.
You make a mean martini, kid.
What's there to do? You found the sliver.
Duke Forrest.
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
And gets the wind every time it opens. No, thanks. I'll take that one.
We been had.
We sure don't aim to cause any trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow on you.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
Nice guy, for an enamel surgeon.
An application to Androscoggin College.
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
You got yourself a bet, Georgia boy.  You're a witness.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
Same here. You can retire my number.
Any time. Whenever we want.
Be right with you.
We could steal one of the choppers.
I looked. Suspicious bastards got them all locked up.
Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
People will talk.
We're a good team.
We think the same way.
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
Anyway, we want to get this letter off.
Don't stop now! Please...
I can't... couldn't.
...trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against...
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
N-n-no thanks, G-General.
Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up.
What?
Also I'm curious whether she's a moaner or...
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
Oh, Jesus.
That's right. We work well together.
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
I think we could still have a chance.
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
It's possible
Hang in there.
How did you get called that?
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
But I'm married.
Something else we have in common.
Very happily married.
Same here.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
Maria...
You're leaving tomorrow?
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
Duke...
You really say the cutest things.
Yes, Reverend?
They're supposed to hold short-arm inspection.
Glad to help.
Let's get his clothes off quick.
Just in dreams?
You guys got any black capsules?
Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
You can cut the bow.
I have not understood what you means.
That. It's out of the act.
I  wouldn't  wish  it  on  a  maneating  shark.
Nope, we're assigned heah.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
You mean who hit who?
Yes, that's what I mean.
I did. First and only blow. So far.
Yes, sir?
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Sir?
Oh, get out of here!
Yes, Colonel.
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Morning, Captain.
What's that, Henry?
I out-coached that General Hammond.
Good morning.
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
Nice.
Arterial silk.
Boys, we're home free.
Are you all right?
He likes you well enough to stick around.
Um-hum.
You got me.
Yes!
Hello.
Uh-huh.
No, thank you.
Yeah, that's the one.
John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
How much money do you get?
Thirty dollars.
No, no, nothat's your seat.
Yes. The John Doe Party.
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
The Websters!
Wait a minute . . .
Huh?
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
The letter.
What letter?
The letter from John Doe.
Oh!
We'll get a handwriting expert to  What!
There is no letter.
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
John Doe.
What John Doe?
Who, for instance?
Anybody! Er, erBeany'll do!
Plus a bonus.
What bonus?
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
I wish he had a family, though.
Oh.
Right here. Sit down.
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Duets? But can we trust him?
Take it easy, John Doe.
No, no, no. Now that's too much!
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Have you seen him?
I ain't seen him for a week.
He's watching the other door.
Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.
Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!
Yeah, a little.
What do you do when you work?
Beany!
Look!
Both of 'em?
Naw.
Who?
Who are they?
Sure. Mostly often.
It must be some kind of a gag.
A gag. A gag!
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
The elevators are still runnin'.
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
Yeh.
You betcha.
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
I want it as soon as possible.
Huh? Get what?
Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.
Were you paid for itor weren't you?
Yes! I was paid! But the
Did you write itor didn't you?
No, I didn't write it, but
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
She isn't?
Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers.
Good night, John.
What do you mean, too bad?
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
Well, you know how they are in baseballif a guy's mixed up in a racket
Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
I didn't see anything.
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
SWAT wants to go in.
You're my hero.
Dinner's on you.
Deal.
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
I'll take half of your action.
Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
You don't want to know.
They want Walter dead!
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
I need to get something straight first.
You're gettin' the car.
You got it.
Is there a problem?
I what?
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
What's the suspect's name?
Earl.
I have to go face to face.
Solis said to keep you clear of this.
Yep.
For now that's all.
Shut the fuck up and do what I say!
Spread it out.
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
If you say so.
Only at the very end.
How do you feel after a shooting.
Like it had to be done.
I've rarely shot anyone.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
Try to remember that.
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
National Marksman Competition.
You don't like New York?
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
How did you like Toronto?
It was okay.
You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
I'm not sure.
I don't really like to drink.
You have to. It's a tradition.
Well, if I have to, I have to.
Why? You like my ass?
You living together?
Explain how that works.
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
Every couple of months, huh?
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
I think so.
So what do I say to this guy?
Get good at it.
It's against my nature.
Yes.
What's the first commandment?
Thou shall have no other God before me.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
Why?
To save lives.
Okay, stop.
You're a compulsive gambler?
I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta.
So what do you want?... An autograph.
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
Still needs work.
That's okay. That's his style.
To run late!
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
Yeah, first and second.
COME ON, RUSSELL!
We lost.
We won.
About six years. My partner took me.
Is it always like this?
Occasionally you lose.
He's cutting down the visibility.
And doing a very good job of it.
Damnit!
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
Pull up alongside.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
And what if you can't live with it?
You've got to decide that for yourself.
Only that floor.
Is the hostage injured?
You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
My name's Scott Roper.
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
You worship yourself.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
This Greg is really getting in my way.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
Maybe you should be.
You heard.
Can I come in?
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
I've proved that, didn't I?
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
If you did, you never showed it.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
As a matter of fact, I do.
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
I've been craving that stuff all week.
And it's hard to get.
Mmm, needs a little something.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
It's okay. We broke up.
When?
Just now.
It's very nice.
...Let me just show you.
And you think he'll...
I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
Scottie...
Do it!
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
Hmm?
I've been thinking.
...the hell are you talking about?
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
The hell I am!
Prude.
I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
What?
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
Okay, I think I could swing that.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
The car is part of the deal.
What happened to your Trans Am?
I'll provide you with transportation.
I want to be put on this case.
Who's running it!
Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
Come on!
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
What do you want?
I need to take back what's mine.
Yes, I believe he has --
Okay...
It's all been transferred.
To live forever.
Because I took it out of your memory.
If you could meet God, what would you say to him?
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
-- If your life's so good up there Gena, what are you doing down here?
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
About what?
Someone who believes in miracles.
Guests?
Just like you always wanted.
That's the grace of this world.  Nothing's impossible.
Nothing, go back to sleep.
Wake up?!
From the dream.
Then what?
You are not a God.
The new world.
It's not real.
Not real?
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
Me?  Of course not.  That's why you're here.
Only up there in the dream they called life.
Unfinished business.
And what about the reconfiguration?
Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
It's his nature.
But what if he doesn't --
-- He will.
We're going to have to reconfigure.
How long?
New York.
I'm South Dakota.
The weather.
Who?
The woman you're stuck on.
But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
-- Christoph changed the maze.
What?
The truth.
It's not used for anything.
He wouldn't say.
The truth.
Not his style.
Katie was digitized.
Why would I do that?
To hide the evidence.
Then where is she?
Come on Tanner, think this through.
Where?
Times Square.
Insurance.
Insurance?
Cleaning up a mess.
Some things never change, do they?
Tanner.
-- You told me.
Night City.
That's not possible.  No one can do that.
Once they digitized you, they added it.
It was a test.
For what?
You weren't real.
Yes.
Way you kiss me.
I know.
But you were with me.
Not you.  A copy.
What's the difference?
Sorry?!
There was no other choice.
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
You don't need a lawyer.  We found the program on your laptop.
This.  No point to it.
Why not?
Because you'll never believe me.
Try me.
There?
Just like that --
Activated.
Program name?
Describe program function.
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Checking connection.
-- Transmit now!
Male.
-- Waiter.
-- Standard.
Scanning body type.
Resurrection.
Access established.
Speed?
Wait a second...  What time is it?
We get Ivan into the Comets PATH--
IMPACT IN EIGHT SECONDS!
If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!
Zordon...  he's gone.
They're called squirbs.
It will not harm you.
I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.
I've never been this sore in my life.
OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!
... Let's take a look over there.
WHITE TIGER!
Activating Power Beam!
Thank you, Dulcea.  For everything.
What does that mean?!
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
... We must try to communicate with them.
About twenty seconds in your time.
TRICERATOPS!
I think so.
WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!
NINJA WOLF ZORD!
We can take these guys!
OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!
GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!
THERE'S THE COMET!
Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.
Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
There's enough for everybody!
If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
A real shame.
BULK!!
Look closer.
... A falcon?
The legend goes that you release the power with the power.
Did I say anything?
Wait for me!
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
Quack like a'duck!
GO IVAN!!
How'd you know?
We couldn't have done it better ourselves.
Activating Power Scope!
What's going on?!
LET'S DO IT!?
NINJA FALCON ZORD!
Sir, we do not use such names at our hotel.
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
But I've never served a day.
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
And a lot more. Can we talk?
Charlie Luciano.
Tell me about it.
But not you.
Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
Not another word.
But from now on it's Lucky's spot.
Maybe that's why I'm the Boss.
Why should I be?
So what happened?
Life knocked me back.
And now you have everything.
No. Not everything.
What do you mean?
Scared.
I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
Can't we get a couple whores over?
What's that divided four ways?
From your mouth ta God's ear.
He's got a line on the good stuff.
If we have to.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
Shane was a friend of yours?
He was around...
Which is why he doesn't need us.
Get word to Maranzano. I want a meet. Alone. On neutral turf.
Who hired the bastard?
Maranzano. Ta ice you.
That ain't what your mama said.
Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach.
Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
I can just imagine.
No. They envy you.
For being a bootlegger?
For being a man.
No. I'm here with you.
I must be going.
For what?
I was calling yesterday.
Something came up.
I needed to see you again.
You're sure?
You got something to hide?
It's too late.
Have you thought about this?
Why? You're the innocent one.
Guess I'm too confused to think.
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
London?
I'm doin' business here!
But there's...
A million bucks. In the last six months.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
Whatta ya mean? It's great!
I'll do fine.
I told you twenty!
It'll just be a few minutes.
I NEED THE TWENTY!
Tommy Reina.
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
Come off it, Bugs.
Ben-jamin.
They don't give a shit about us!
Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
Ya piss like a man.
It's only us and Sonny. Hey, Sonny. Come on out.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
He's trying to make it.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
What the fuck does that mean?
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
I know about you.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
Didn't know you felt that way.
And I got it all planned.
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
They're friends of our enemy.
Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
Not stupid. Fat.
Couple hands. No harm in it.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
So? I'll get Bugs ta do it.
I must know more of you, my son.
Not a lot ta know.
Don, I'd be honored.
I've got friends.
You get fifteen percent.
I got partners.
We learn from life.
That's why I'm here.
I'll take care of the Boss.
They do what I tell 'em.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
The terms will be mine.
What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
Thank you for keeping me informed.
We were overdue to get hit.
And what do you want out of this?
A peaceful and prosperous retirement.
Wanna know what I think?
Spare us.
Come on. Be polite.
Hell. It's been four days!
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
If it comes to that. Yeah.
Yeah. But he needs me alive.
Luciano is dead?
Kill them! Kill them!
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
Now that's a hard number.
That a Jew compliment?
Best we got.
Kinda early for Christmas, Bugs.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
What?
Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
Olive or eyeball?
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now.
Thank me next time you see me.
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
Why?
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
Sure. Why?
You're acting kind of...odd.
<i></i> In what way?
Ohhh, nothing.
Got a doctor on duty.
Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
I might wake up.
I don't think so.
Are you okay??
I'd better go report this...
It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
My <u>tail</u> itches.
Give me a date, Doctor.
Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING -
<u>What</u> union?
Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. - DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
There's a thing here! There's a switch!
What?
Isn't that Lulu?
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
I just need to use the phone, lady.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
Have a nice day.
And you don't deal drugs?
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
You want to come inside?
Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything.
You don't like where I live?
... What are they all doing there?
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
How are you doing sweetheart?
I'm good.
Dating anyone?
You know ...  ... whoops!
Mother!
But I was dusting.
He seemed quite taken with you.
I don't want to talk about it.
You know, you never tell me anything.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Mm hmm.
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.
Oh.  You need a cappuccino.
He's an organic farmer.
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
You mean it's dangerous?
Thirty is base price.  Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up.
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
Swell. Thanks very much.  Good luck, Senator. Keep your left up.
You've never *seen* this contract.
Never.
Looks like it, but--
But it *isn't*?
It couldn't be.
I'm saying I didn't sign it!
Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.
I'll brain that guy! Well--call Paine-- call Saunders--
Let's send out a pigeon!
Blow a bugle!
Sure--sure. He must have a compass with him.
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
Okay. For the dollar, I give you McGann *and* Bill and Carl. I got Paine.  Hello... Oh, yes.
What's this, Diz?
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
What! Who?
You know--little worms--ambition.
Whadaya mean--*right*?
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
Certainly.  Now there's the principal actor in our little play.
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
You play--left field.
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
Yeah. What about the second act?
Oh--yeah--
"There's more light here," he says--
Yeah. Funny--
Yeah.
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
Diz--
Yeah.
How about getting married?
Good idea. When?
Tonight?
Okay. You don't mind?
I'll cherish ya.
No.
Do we *have* to?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
Well, let's get going.
Where?
We're gonna get married.
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
What?
My first name's--Clarissa.
Right now--everything I own--!
You know, we're getting married.
Take me home, Diz.
He's a house-afire!
That infernal phone!
Sam Foley--dead!
Great saints!
Can't that wait, Hubert?
Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
All right, why?
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
Henry Hill.
We can't help *what* they were! Forget 'em!
I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!
*You won't?*
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
*But you never asked me*!
Oh--Jim!
I doubt it! Come on, Ken.
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
Is *what* getting me down?
Oh, a *boy*!
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
Jeff for Senator.
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Emma!
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Yes. Come in.
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
Certainly. Step right in.
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
I beg your pardon?
Just a minute, I better make sure.
Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
What? Who?
You have?  Will you come in a minute, Miss Saunders.
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
Saunders said--this whole thing was *his* idea to get graft--!
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
"Boy Stuff." Why, printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff. You're just like your father.
Here--where are you running off to?
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
Goodnight, Jeff.
Goodnight, Miss Paine.
Will he yield for a question?
Ah, now, that's better.
Will he *yield*?
Mr. President--
No, Jeff--please--!
Jefferson--
Yes, Ma?
Now, now, now!  It's all right, Governor.
What?
How's Amos, Ma?
Just fine.
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
Office of--Senator Smith?
*No*!
The man downstairs said number--
No!
J-Jefferson Smith.
The Dome--the Capitol Dome--
I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
You *couldn't*?
Punch?
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
I see. *This* one is so simple--
And with your help--
A *day*!
Tonight.
Committee.
Why?
Good. Where are we?
Some committee's got it.
What?
The Steering Committee.
Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
Thanks very much.
And a *lot* of paper!
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
Yes, yes--
Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
Since sixteen or so.
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
I also answer to whistles.
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
I know. It's--Violet.
It *is* not!
No!
Letitia.
No! Stop it!
I've got more. You better tell me.
You win. It's--Clarissa.
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
You--don't know it, do you?
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Oh--*Saunders*!
Saunders--
But--I've done everything I--
Hurray!
To a hard night's work, son. Come on! 
If you thought as much of being honest-- as you do of being smart--!
Then you *did* say it.
No--I mean--yes--that is--
I'm splendid, too.
That's--that's splendid.
No! No! Gosh. See, there you are! I'm not making sense!
I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--
How's that, buddy?
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
Yeah? Well, when I get my hands on a red-headed doll with a southern lingo, I'll--
What do you mean? What's going on?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine.
Let's get away from here. 
That's dynamite, Joe!
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
--now he wants to talk to the Congressmen from the Willet Creek districts--he's run their names down--
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
Oh, now--that won't do--
What do you mean?
He's lost complete faith in me--
Well--me, too!
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
What are you talking about? What difference--?
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
Don't worry about Horace--he'll take orders. Come on--
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
Congressmen, Radner, Schultz, Diggs--
Just a minute, Joe!
You can't say *that* to--
Anything *better* to offer?
Maybe he won't get up.
But--if he *does*, Joe--
No--I--I'll take a walk-- 
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
How nice. How do you do, Senator?
And Honest Abe's ideals. A rare man-- these days.
Senator Paine.
Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Some people like it.
Morning, neighbors. Morning.
Yes.
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
He was a seven-months baby.
Oh yes, pixilated.
Uh-huh.
And sings.
He sure is pixilated.
Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.
Yes, you own it.
Yes, indeedy.
He sure is.
Yes, sir.
Any children?
No, no children.
Next, please.
No.
Why not?
Would you like to go for a walk?
Are these the articles?
Yes!
NO!!
But they did take place?
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
And you saw them happen?
Yes, but I
That's all, Miss Bennett.
It isn't all! I'd like to explain
That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.
What's that got to do with it?
You are , aren't you?
Yes!!!
Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
Look, this is my house. I'd like to
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
Oh - uh - nothing.
Really?
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
What did they say?
Do you always wear your hair like that?
Yeah, let's.
Now, what do you see?
Why don't you try?
Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
What did you mean by that?
I'm from a small town too, you know.
Gosh! What do you know about that!
You have?
He did? I play the tuba
Yeah, I know.
The drums. He taught me to play some.
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
I'll get my hat.
All right.
Are you? When?
In a day or so, I think.
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
Mary - I - excuse me
Oh, hello darling.
Nothing.
No. It's nothing.
I'm crucifying him.
People have been crucified before.
Why? Why do we have to do it?
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
We're not going out tonight.
With pay!
With pay!
Uh-huh.
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
Is he really that big a sap?
Had the boys follow us.
You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.
Last night he proposed to me.
Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
I'm going to tell him the truth.
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
I tell you that dame's nuts.
Hurry up!
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
Boy, was he burning.
Come on - let's go!
Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Who? Miss Dawson?
Yes, sir.
Me, sir?
Yes, sir.
Fourteen carat?
Yes, sir.
Is that the best you've got?
Oh, yes sir.
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
Yes.
Perfect! Perfect!
I wish you luck, sir.
Let me go! I wanna see him!
He's not home, I tell you!
I wanna see that guy!
We'll send for the police!
Better wire him right away, John.
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
This is outrageous!
Mr. Cedar!
Mr. Cedar!
You can't?
What?
That tuba player!
Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N
All set.
Yes.
How do you do.
How do you do.
Are your parents living?
Why, no.
He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
No, thank you.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
I've got one for Cobb
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
No, thanks.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was.
That's funny. Why is that?
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Oh.
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
What do you think bodyguards are for?
Are those stories true?
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
We own an opera house, don't we?
Naturally.
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
Well, thanks, I - uh  How do you do? What is your name?
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
Yes, sir.
I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
No, I mean - about my client.
Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
Yes?
Thank you, Your Honor.
I'm a writer myself, you know.
I write poetry.
Uh-huh.
Oh, the poet? Where?
I don't know.
Christian Svenson.
Farmer?
Yes, ma'am.
Where is your farm?
South Dakota north.
South Dakota - north?
South Dakota - but on the top.
Oh. Oh!
Yeah. What?
Is Mary home?
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one.
Thank you so much. Good night.
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Excuse me. What did you say?
Every man to his taste, sir.
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
Yes, sir.
I just wanted to make sure.
What's that?
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
Prairie? Oysters?
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
I did what!
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
Me, sir?
Yeah.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir. Here it is right here, sir. There, sir.
No!  What do you want!!
Why are they ganging up against me?
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
Hmm?
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
Mr. Cook.
Could you come with me please?
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
No. It's sort of spur of the moment.
You're the shrink, aren't you?
No, not really.
But you do therapy?
Not any more.
Ernest, what do you think?
I think he's got a point.
It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
Right now?
I don't want to hear any more today.
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
Stop now.
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
You find it distasteful, don't you?
Go to hell.
Now we're back on track.
You are so mean.
It's a thought I had.
Should I open it now?
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
Doc. Nice to meet you.
Althea hasn't told you?
We've been talking about her, mostly.
She seems very unhappy.
What?
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
I'd better get in there.
That's a lot of people all at once.
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
You do?
Yeah.
Well, come on in.
My patient had to leave early.
Who was that?
Oh, I don't know...
You like me. How come?
Not sure. Let me think about it.
Doc.  Ainge...
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
You're on your own today, honey.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
...so accomplished.
Lily.
Doc.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
Sure I can, Lionel.
Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
Thanks for your help, Lionel.
Don't need it.
That would explain it.
Can you help Mom?
I'm trying.
Got to.
Is she a friend of yours?
Martin.
Did you straighten her out?
We're going for a walk.
Oh... not a real doctor.
What do you mean?
I think you know what I mean.
No, I really don't.
I think you do.
Why don't you tell me?
Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
Just who is here, can you tell me?
Could I see Sofie, please?
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Oh boy... this should be interesting.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
Is she against you getting help?
We don't discuss it.
Something's bothering her.
What?
You've got a funny idea of funny.
No.
Really? What would it take?
Sorry... I'm done.
Uh-huh.
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
Life.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
Is that like a party trick?
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
It's all right.
And this is legitimate therapy?
Which thing?
That's one way to put it.
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
You're upset.
Transference!
Transference.
Hello.
Which show was that?
Sofie...
You're not the only one...
But...
I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
Will you think about it?
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
What is your name?
Will you wait for me?
We're only talking about six weeks.
Weekly or monthly?
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
It's a big part of the show.
It's my bit for the community.
What do you want me to see?
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
What are you talking about?
Was it something that happened at school?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
True. Should we stop them?
He said -- "Which we already knew!"
How are you?
Nah... scotch.
Have you thought about getting a wife?
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
This is exactly what I wanted.
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
Good-looking woman.
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
This --
That's all right. What's on your mind?
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
Jerking off?
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
A doll?
Definitely.
Just you.
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
It matters to me.
I can tell you anything else.
What about everything? How did this happen?
Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
Everybody has a story, Skip.
Sounds like you have several.
It wasn't the best situation.
Did you carry a gun?
You were messed up, man.
But look at me now...
Things got a lot worse.
You and Candy...?
That'd be Lily.
How'd you do it?  The new you.
All new people start with that...
Psych major?
English Lit.
See you Thursday... regular time.
You want my advice? Far out!
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
Wow.
Yes, yes it does...
Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath?
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
Priests. Imhotep's priests.
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
Well, okay then.
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
And then killing your sister.
Excuse me?
In the desert? What for?
None of the above, thank you.
Then what the hell are you doing here!?
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
'Cause I look good doin, it.
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
Oh, hey, how ya doin'?
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
Do you know where I can steal some?
What friend? You're my only friend.
You shall see.
That's one way of putting it.
Oh yes, always.
Yeah! Them.
What is he doing here?
To have stopped this creature? Yes!
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
You will not believe it.
Try me.
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
If we want to kill the creature, yes.
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
Water turning to blood.
What did you do to him!?
Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
To be hanged.
I am an English woman.
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
Proceed!
Three hundred pounds!
I would never!
Twenty.
What are you doing here?
Broad?!
No?
Because that's where I found it. I was there.
I just decked your brother
Yes, well...  I know my brother.
You swear?
Every damn day.
No, I mean --
I found sand. I saw death.
Really want to know?
Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
If you call that a kiss.
The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
I know my treasure.
Are you sure?
The things that get you excited.
Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.
For entering the afterlife.
You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
You don't believe in curses, huh?
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
No you're not.
I'm not?
Not unless you call me Rick.
Why would I do that?
Because that's my name.
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here!
It's everybody's problem!
FINE.
I have no choice.
Right now, I only wish to join them.
Yes?
I think you found something.
You lied to me!
That just makes you more gullible.
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
Way to go, Evy.
Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit.
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
Did you ever see him eat?
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
Well neither do I, thank you.
Shut-up and get me off of here!
Read the inscription on the cover!
Oh.
Yes,... I see.
Um, well, you see...
I only gamble with my life, never my money.
Awfully.
Be nice. That thing saved my life.
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
And you're sure you can find the secret compartment?
If he decides to wake up, hell yes!
Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!
And then he'll be coming after Evy.
And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
What?
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
You have got to be joking?
I knew you'd know.
I know you knew I'd know.
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
Except for one little thing.
And what's that?
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
Your mind is so slippery.
Head hunting.
One last tweak.
I'll be down in a jiffy.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
Do I?
My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
I was eight.
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
And some sandwiches --
Do it, big boy!
Atta, boy!
Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
I'm the Bowler.
He was cute though.
The Inscrutable Six?
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
Me, too.
They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
Let's do it.
I thought you'd never ask.
Half a Dirty Dozen!
I dunno.
Sure.
Doctor Heller?
Yes!
How's your dad?
He's dead.
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
Get on to yourself!
Have you considered my offer?
What about Captain Amazing?
Should I kill them?
Why bother?
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Are you with me... or against me?
Too bad. PLUG HIM!
So are you!
Frankenstein!
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
Just a waitress.
You underestimate yourself.
Terrific.
Just wanted to... powder my nose.
Why not?
Me.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Then why are you here?
Curiosity.
Remember the cat.
You're a spy.
What?
Only when I'm awake... You busy after work?
Not tonight. 
Alone tonight?
Every night.
Yeah.
That was easy. 
Why?
Who wouldn't?
What's your real name?
Roy.
Have you always lived here?
Yeah.
What have they got that we ain't got?
That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.
Monica, where are you?
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
I'm going inside.
What are you talking about?
Bye. 
Good or evil, what's the difference?
And you are a fool.
And a skunk stinks!
It is not dead. It is hiding.
LOOK!
We had an off night, that's all.
So when are we gonna have an on night?
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
Yeah yeah -- and that, too.
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
Because that's what it is.
But I just don't feel it.
Are you coming or not?
I'll drive.
Not a chance!
With what?
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
So why don't you just tell her!
Why not?
Who's chicken? 
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
See ya tomorrow.
But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
Wait!... Look!
Shhh.
He hasn't stolen it yet.
Come on.
The Eradicators!
Anybody got any?
Hey... he's gone.
Really? Like Captain Amazing?
Not yet.
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
Ow.
Oh hi, Mom.
Looking for... the TV Guide.
Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
Mother... it's not what you think!
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
I use it... to fight evil.
It is?
Definitely.
Ask her out.
Who are they?
The Disco Boys.
This looks like a job for Superman --
Or both.
Sorry.
Shut up.
The who?
Yeah, but how do we get to them?
Whatever our name is.
Are you sure he's still alive?
The bazookas?
And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
But how do we get in?
It's suicide.
Great timing!
May the forks be with us!
Through there!
Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
Ah -- you approve?
I think it's absolutely charming.
I'm glad you like it.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
I did, sir.
Things are quite serious, I should say.
What forces do you have at your disposal?
Cavalry?
There are none here.
You could have them here by daybreak.
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
Properly arranged, yes.
These are odds of 8 to 1.
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
You realize what is at stake?
Our lives, the revolution, my career?
And where is the army?
It is on this road, sire, following me.
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
Bertrand, sire.
Come back in an hour.
Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
You may go, Captain Charles.
A glass of champagne, please.
Bastia -- and you?
Ajaccio.
Have you been back recently?
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
Why are you carrying the dog?
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
When you eat him, may I have some?
Four o'clock.
My God, what a fire!
The first reports came in at about ten.
Why didn't you wake me then?
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
How did it spread so quickly?
It is the work of incendiaries.
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
Yes -- an excellent idea.
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
Would you like some brandy?
Thank you.
I'll have the fire built up.
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Lisette.
Only Lisette?
Lisette La Croix.
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
Not even the slightest hint of something?
When is she supposed to return?
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
May I offer you a drink?
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
Yes, of course.  Hortense, darling, will you tell Louise to bring some sherry?
Do you expect me to believe that?
Were they pretty?
Yes.
One had better legs.
Were any of them married?
I cannot promise you that.
Promise me.
Promise.
Promises mean nothing.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
All right -- I promise.
You are my old friend.
Open the door.  It's me.
Go away -- I'm busy.
I know what you're doing in there.
Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
What are you doing in there?
Yes!!
Goodbye.
Yes.
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
Why did you give it to him?
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
I wrote it.
Yes, I wrote it.
You wrote it.
I couldn't face telling you.
You couldn't face telling me what?
About Hippolyte Charles.
What was there to tell?
My God, what do you think?
God help me -- yes.
How do you know?
I know.
How do you know?
Yes, of course.  What do you want?
I believe so.  I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet, in Paris.
You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
Yes, I do -- very much.
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
Yes, he has.
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
Eugene de Beauharnais.
Is he alone?
Yes, sir.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
Send him in.
A message from Citizen Fouche.
Let me have it.
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
Send him in.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
That's it?
Go, fo' I change my mind.
Naw, it ain't like that.
Well, let me in.
Why you say that?
'Cause your lips is getting black.
Suga!
Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
Don't move me.
I'm his cousin.
Yes you did.
I'll do it.
What happen?
You know what he mean, dude.
I'm gone.
Come on, Day, try it.  For moms.
It's something in that hydraulic pump.
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
That's the sister.
What you mean, so?
Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
That ain't gonna work.
Still gonna smell it.
Sorry about today, man.
I didn't see nothing.
How you know?  It could be anything.
Naw, you go first.
You go first.
No.
I ain't scared of you.  We ain't little no more.
Wait for what?
What about me?
I don't know.  Probably next Friday.
Oh yeah, why you walking?
My brothers won't give me a ride.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
Better sooner than later.
What are you doing here?
It's locked.
So what?  Let's make'em wait.
Okay.
Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
Hold on.
I said hold on!
Well bring yo' ass on...
It ain't about being a punk, son.  It's about this...
What it smell like?
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
Just hold your breath.
It's alright.
I'll remember.
I saw it.
Smokin' what?
Nothing.
Peace out, Craig.
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
I don't have no damn cover.
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
Well, you gonna have to go postal then.
You damn right that's the big one.
You don't wanna know.
R-U-S-H Intensely.
Let it go, Roach, trust me.
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.
Butterflies, my ass.  I'm about to go home.
Where's Craig?
He's inside the house?
Why did he go in the house?
Go for it.
Ya'll live around here?
I don't know.
He's a boy, dude.
Thanks for the help.
I got fired too.
What?!
Sorry, my ass.
I don't know.
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
I don't believe this sugar shit. Something ain't right.
Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?
I don't know, Debo.
Yeah.
Keep pushing.
What?
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
I don't know.
Good, let's get out.
I don't know.
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
Nothing.  What you want?
Yeah, and hurry up.
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
Don't get it twisted, Elroy.  I ain't lost none of my street skills.
I got my mase.
Shut yo' ass up.
The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.
What's the matter?
Craig, you ain't the only lightweight around here.
I threw my back, again.
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!
Who, him? Just visiting.
What happened here?
Nothing. I broke a lamp.
That's my girl.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
I've been a bad boy.
What?
Uh, yes..
Business or pleasure?
Business.
What?
The grave. Somebody close?
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
Its'...ah...about my daughter....
I...
Yes?
Of course.  I wish everything were that easy.
My security people are right next door.
I have a problem.
Ah.
You were very nervous.
What the hell are you saying?
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
I would also like to apologize.
For what?
For not believing you.
Same to you.
I'd like to know what...
Don't worry. She's good with kids.
Good.
What's your point?
I will do no such thing.
Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
Where did you get these? Who are you?
The gun...
What about the gun?
Then I have time for a drink.
How should I...?
Tell me why he's dead.
You fucked up.
I kill her - and you kill me.
Keep your voice down.
Even if you don't, Her Security men will.
That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
That's right. That gives you...
I want'to talk to her.
You know what I'm gonna do.
What? Walk out there and twist her arm off?
No, that's,..that's fine
Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
No! You can't! They're in on it.
I think you're right.
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
How did you see us kiss?
Nods.
Let' s do it.
Yes. Yes, I can hear you.
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
I know you do, honey.
I promise.
All right. Kisses to you.
No...kisses to you.
No. Kisses to you.
No, kisses to...
Keep it.
It's a twenty.
Keep it.
Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
I remember. The big tipper.
Please. Something is going to happen...
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
What?
Kill the Governor.
Don't think I won't.
Hi.
Irene is going to help.
Thank you.
I don't know.
Thanks for the tip.
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
I don't think so.
You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that!
Gimme a dollar.
Fuck you!
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
I've done much better ones than this.
You have, huh?
You're a big girl, huh?
Why?
I've got something for you.
A surprise?
Yeah.
It doesn't look like it.
It better be.
Nah.  Hates his wife.
Where?
I kill her anyway.
You're wasting time.
'Daddy has to go now.
Do it!
Yeah.
Put her on.
What gives?
Just put her on.
No.
He carried on some; kicked.
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Listen to me John.
Dad, you're bleeding...
You understand?
Not even her?
And I won't never tell about the money.
I been mindin' Pearl.
Just fine.
Well goodnight, boy. Come again -- any time.
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
Don't!
It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.
She went.
You have all sinned!
Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes!
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
How do you mean?
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
About what!
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Sshhh! He's in there.
I'll be switched!...
All to pieces!
A man of the Cloth?
Bluebeard!
Twenty-five wives!
Tricked us!
He's Satan hiding behind the Cross!
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
John don't like him much.
Pearl dotes on him.
What?
The money, Icey.
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
Get along with you.
You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
Ah.
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
Thank you, no. Thank you, dear Icey. I'll tend to them. Thank you.
There! What's so hard about that!
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
Blue men.
You better not sing that song.
'Cause you're too little.
Sshhh...
Hm?
John! Don't!
Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
She's gone to Moundsville.
To see Dad?
Yes, I reckon that's it.
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
No, that's just it. No.
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
It'll spoil our supper.
Hush, Pearl. Come on.
Hush.
Ssh...
Dead.
Dead. 
Up river.
Well, shoot! Maybe there was!
I'll make coffee.
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
Nothin'!
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
What's taking you so long about it?
What's that you're playing with, boy?
The summer is young yet, little lad.  Pearl?
I'll tell.
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
What?
Don't you believe me?
Under the stone in the floor.
You could save him, little bird.
Come to me, boy!
Now it's your turn.
What secret shall I tell?
How old are you?
That's no secret. I'm five.
What's your name?
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
Where's the money hid.
Can I have milk too?
No.
Why, pray tell?
Because John said I mustn't.
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
Can I have this?
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
Pearl and John.
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
Only she won't never let me play with it.
Yes; from the first night.
The first night?
Our honeymoon.
How's that?
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
I was praying.
Harry, what --
Get up.
I -- no, I --
I'm through, Harry.
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
How'do.
It's about that John and that Pearl?
My flesh and blood!
Where's your Missus?
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
Didn't you hear me, boy?
Them kids!
What are you after them for?
None of your business, Madam.
When did I ever?
This man down at the Drugstore...
I been out with men.
He never asked me for nothin'.
Pearl and John.
John and Pearl!
What?
The man! The man!
Thank God.
Get the kit!
Jesus.
Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
Because he was scary, that's why.
Who was scary?
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
Okay, okay.  I think.
Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
Just checking -- keep out of sight!
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
Well what you reading it for?
Oh. Hi, how y'doing?
The killer.
How you plan to do that?
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
Okay. Hi, dad.
What?
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
Just want to talk to him a second.
You don't know he did it.
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
I don't mean her --
Uh, she just saw you, sir...
Krueger.
Krueger?
Maybe you don't think murder's serious --
School.
Right home after. See you.
I won't.
Get into bed.
I will.
Great
To bed with you, c'mon.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
Nancy?
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
Put that damned thing down!
Nancy!
S'curity.
Proof he's declawed. As for him, we buried him good and deep.
We should get her out of here...
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
You were screaming like crazy.
The door was locked from your side.
How the fuck do I know?  I don't expect you to believe me.
Because somebody cut her. While I watched.
He's nuts about you.
Really. Turn 'er up a little.
Rod and I are done. He's too much of a maniac.
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
Jungle man fix Jane.
No more fights?
No more fights.
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Bring me forty-five back.
It's from Paris.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
Aren't you late?
What are you serving?
An omelet.
And you too, Ninotchka.
About what?
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
You should. I'll show you.
Well, a hat...
What was it like?
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
Evening gown?
What do you wear in the morning?
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
Just for the honeymoon.
He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
...and little Lady Beatrice?
Possibly.
Positively not!
Or we can't go back to Russia!
...des raisins de Madre, des framboises... 
Yes, he looks like a comrade!
And they might believe her in Moscow.
What do you mean they might -- they will!
Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
That's right... and we might as well face it.
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
How many families live here with you?
Just see how happy the people look... from here....
Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
Monsieur.
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
Why should you be afraid?
You didn't get legal advice?
Yes, Comrade?
With two f's, if you please.
Don't worry... there will be enough.
I must be stern with you.
We have opened a restaurant...
Good morning, Gaston.
Good evening, Monsieur.
Go to bed.
I don't feel like any breakfast.
Eight forty-two, sir.
I guess it is eight forty-two.
Yes, General Savitzky?
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
Thank you, Louis.
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
What is it, my boy?
How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
While you eat, you look at the view.
It's a real Paris reunion.
...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
...Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves... into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
If you want to see us you must come later.
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow.
I'll send you a muff.
I think she covered you with the parasites.
Comrade.
Comrade Kopalski...
Comrade.
A week?
A day.
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
Look for yourselves.
Just looking around.
Monsieur.
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
But, gentlemen, I am afraid...
Right away... instantly!
All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!
Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
No, thank you.
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
Well, we're back home.
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.
Don't hold that against me... please!
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
What business?
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
No visa.
Oh no. No visa.
On what?
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Me?
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You might hold this for me.
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
I'll try.
Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
Yes, very strange.
Then you don't want me to go there.
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.
Ni-notchka.
That is correct.
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
Thank you.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
Don't do it, please.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
Wounded? How?
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
It's twelve o'clock.
No, that was restful. Again.
The telephone is ringing.
Let's forget that we ever met.
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
Then do it through my lawyer!
I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
I didn't follow you.
I always eat here.
This is a place for workmen.
Must one always be after something?
Why?
Just smile.
At what?
Then you should go back to your table.
Do you like Scotch stories?
I have never heard one.
Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
Did you make any change in this room?
I don't think so.
And General Savitzky.
You must, darling.
To the loveliest story I ever heard.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
Thursday.
Darling, darling... please!
I must talk to my brothers!
Shhh! Shhh!
Comrades! Good people of France!
Now, Ninotchka... please!
No speech.
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
And I adore you, Ninotchua.
No. Nobody will find us.
Yes... a little white house.
Not white, darling.
All right, we'll make it red.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
...and we won't clench our fist...
No! No!
Our salute will be a kiss.
Yes... a kiss... salute!
Much happier.
All right.
Radio! What is radio?
No, no music.
But I can throw it out of the window.
So happy and so tired.
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
Good morning, Swana.
Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand francs!
Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
That bad?  Old or young?
Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you.
Is this your new dress suit?
Yes, Swana.
Am I interrupting?
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
Do you expect me to believe that?
Hello.
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
I must ask you to leave.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
In that case I can only say good-by.
What do you want?
May I have your bags, madame?
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
That depends on the tip.
Thank you.
Yes... leaving immediately.
But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
Can you recommend a restaurant?
At Pre Mathieu's.
Where is that?
It's just a place for workmen.
Where is it?
How do you do, my friend.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
Then tell Richardson to fire him.
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
Yeah?  Well, I own the fucking casino.
Then what about this Washington Post crap?  Woodwind and Fernstein?
What?
Nobody knows more about this thing than you do, John.
Yes ... I got the money.
Is it?
That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying?
You do it.
Why me?
You think this is just about politics?
I figured that out.
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
He wants money.
Pay him.
No, sir.
I thought the gloves were off.
Well, no place where they speak English.  That way he can always say he was misquoted.
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
There's no secrets here, Al.
'Night, Al.
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
Cox!  Fire him.
Can we get around this, Al?
It's the Supreme Court, sir; you don't get around it.
That was civil war.
How do you see this?
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
That fruitcake!  What about him?
I did?
We were working on China.
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
You never told him?
Sir?
You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks.
Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
This could be it ... this could be it. Four long years ...
Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
We could leverage Helms.
How?
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
Townsend gave us 300 grand.  Belgium's not worth more than 100, 150 ...
No ...
Why me?
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
Is it my turn?
Thou must.
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
Harold ... can I get you anything?
I'm interested in the documents that put your people together with ... the others.  All of them ...
Not if I give you all the cards ...
The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
Mr. Castro.
Yes.
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
So President Kennedy thought.
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
Winning?
You should ask Bobby.
I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
I never met the man.
Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
The White House.
You're fucking me.
I won't tell him if you won't.
Her name's Sandy ...
Presidents don't threaten.  They don't have to.  Good day, gentlemen.
But they all got it back again, didn't they?  We should have lunch sometime.
Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
We have to entertain the possibility ...
Jews and Negros don't win elections, Henry.  Better to hang them around the Democrats' necks.
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
Idiotic?  Yes, I suppose it was.
Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
Don't be too proud; never be too proud to go on your knees before God.
What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing.
Of course.
Yes, Mr. President.
Did you cry when he died?
Why?
I was the lesser of two evils.
The real war is in us.  History is a symptom of our disease.
I came down here to close a deal for Studebaker.
When they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you!
What the hell -- I love her.  And she's great in bed.
Don't worry -- I'll use the old Nixon charm on her.
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
That was a long time ago.
... but it was all we had.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
You're shittin' me.
Where you from?
Syracuse.
Hello ...
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Elvis I like, too.
Then what's the point?  What's the point of being president?  You're powerless.
Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
POWs.  And their families.
So I'm supposed to be ...
Compassionate.  Grateful.
Proud?
Sir?
Of them.
Yes, yes.
Fire him.
... and get rid of all these "goddamns" and "Jesus Christs"!
I know ...
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
It's over, Dick.
Not that.  Us.
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
Are you serious?
Yeah ... I'm out.
Is that the truth?
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
You don't have to go.
They've lost a brother.  You know what that means, Dick.
We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
I don't want them to love me.
Do you really want this, Dick?
This.  Above all.
And then you'll be happy?
Then I'll be there for you.
Can I just ask for one thing?
Are you okay?
Yes, it's been a long time ...
Then what are you scared of, honey?
Yes!
You personally?
When?
You.  What' you're doing --
And what am I doing?
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
Hiding what?
Brezhnev's coming in three days.  I don't want to deal with them.  And him.  And you.
What matters to me is whether you understand it.
Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy.
Lost.
Someday, Dick.
What?
The "crises"?
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
Who else'd be in your truck.
You heard it?
How's that?
She just told me you was quittin'. Sit down.
'Predate it.
How fresh is this coffee?
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
How come're you doin that?
I don't know. I feel overmatched.
Yes I do.
Nineteen zero and nine.
Believe it was that night. She buried him the next mornin'.  Diggin' in that hard caliche.
I'm... discouraged.
No ID in her room?
Try "old" on for size.
Yessir. It may be that. In a nutshell.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
Well what would you call him.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
No I ain't.
Nothin'?
Would you tell me if you had?
It's not me he's in trouble with.
Who's he in trouble with then?
Some pretty bad people.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
I don't know. My mind wanders.
Yessir. We should a brought wieners.
You sure?
That's the boy.
You figure him for a dope runner?
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
But you don't believe it.
No. Probably I don't.
It's a mess, ain't it Sheriff?
Gun out and up.
I'm hidin' behind you.
Believe you're right.
That from the lock?
So when was he here?
I'm ahead of you there.
Wasn't no bullet.
Yessir. Wasn't none.
Well I don't either!
Yessir. It was punched out.
Okay.
You gonna drive out there?
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
He's goin' back out there and he wanted to know if you wanted to go with him.
Yes I do. You don't want to lie without what it's absolutely necessary.
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
I always am.
Don't get hurt.
I never do.
Don't hurt no one.
Well. If you say so.
Okay.
I can't plan your day.
I mean, would you care to join me.
Lord no. I'm not retired.
I don't know. Had dreams.
Well they always is to the party concerned.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
I put it in, Mama.
Well I didn't see it.
I ain't got the money.
No.
...I need to sit down.
No. But I gave my word.
You gave your word?
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
It's full a money.
That'll be the day.
At the gettin' place.
No. I found it.
Llewelyn!
What? Quit hollerin'.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
I need to know that.
Just keep it up.
What're you doin', baby?
Goin' out.
Goin' where?
What're you goin' to do?
Well then I'll tell her myself.
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
Yes I do.
Uh-huh.
You should be used to that.
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
Yes ma'am?
You are comin back, ain't ya?
I shall return.
Hey.
What should I do?
I can hear it in your voice.
She'll be all right?
I know where the money is.
If you knew, you would have it with you.
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
What's that.
You mean the nature of this conversation?
I mean the nature of you.
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Did you go up to his trailer?
Yes I did.
I can't say.
Where does he work?
Is Llewelyn there?
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
You expect him?
Step out of the car please, sir.
Screwgie.
In the truck.  I'll get it.
Not a bleep.
All right...
No me mate.
You from around here?
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
Airport.
Well -- where ya goin'?
I don't know.
I don't need to talk to you.
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
Do you know where I'm going?
Yeah? Where am I?
All right.
You know she won't be there.
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
So what're you goin' up there for.
Yes.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
That's foolish. You pick the one right tool.
Sixty-nine cent.
This. And the gas.
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
What way would that be?
I seen you was from Dallas.
Didn't mean nothin'.
I was just passin' the time.
I don't know. Will there?
With what?
With anything?
You already asked me that.
Well... I need to see about closin'.
See about closing.
Yessir.
What time do you close?
Now. We close now.
I could come back then.
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
You live in that house behind the store?
You've lived here all your life?
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
I don't know. I couldn't say.
Call it?
Yes.
For what?
Just call it.
How's that?
All right. Heads then.
...Where you want me to put it?
They'll give you a wallop.
Uh-huh.
You already have the tent?
Somethin' like that.
What kind of tent?
The kind with the most poles.
That's twenty-six dollars.
You on all night?
Okay.
I want you to take me to another motel.
Let's just call it square.
When did you last see him.
November the 28th, last year.
Well enough.
That's not an answer.
What do you want to know?
Yes?
I'm sorry.
Goodbye, Mr. Wells.
The what?
The option.
I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.
You want to change rooms?
What else then?
Lookin' for what's comin'.
I do like you.
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
How would you describe him?
I know how he found me.
It's called a transponder.
Not any way.
Took me about three hours.
I been immobile.
No. You don't understand.
What did you do?
I'm a welder.
Yes.
I don't mean braze.
I didn't say braze.
Pot metal?
What did I say?
Were you in Nam?
Yeah. I was in Nam.
So was I.
To kill your wife.
The heroin. You don't have it.
No I don't have it.
No. You don't.
You do, I reckon.
That is correct. And how do I decide?
Are you jackin' with me?
No sir.
Don't jack with me.
Are you in the service?
No sir. I'm a veteran.
Nam?
Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW! GOODBYE!
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
You should get the order you want.
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
Did you send anyone out there?
You better handle what's in this garbage can first.
Anyway, so what?
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
A woman can write a check.
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
We think we know where Betty is.
Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?
Tell him what you told me.
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
Well, do something, then, damnit!
Any idea where it is?
Little place called "Williams," why?
-- small-time, pissant, Barney Fife --
YOU shut up!  They're beautiful, but get them some water.
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
I've got the working gun, Elden, me! You wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there.
No, I was just... How you doing?
Great. Good. Content...
Oh. How come?
You must be joking.
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
...I... I know what you are.
Do you know why I'm here?
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
This is really awkward...
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
The LeSabre!
Maroon.  I stole it.
What?
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
I gotta go make dinner.
Are you and Larry happy?
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Well, you are.
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
I gotta go.
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
We were engaged.
No, Del.
I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
You're late, Eric.
Yes, she is.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
I ran back in to get the phone.
What?
...well, then you ain't got much.
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to...
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
It was Chloe...
Roy! What are you doing here?
You're in serious danger!
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
Los Angeles, California.
Sure I loved it! It was great.
No. Loma Vista.
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
What's his real name?
Dr. David Ravell.
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
Worse.
You made out alright.
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer.
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
...did I win some contest?
He has no heartbeat!
You're hurting him!!
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
So why'd you come to L.A.?
I came for love. My fianc is here.
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
The one you were telling me about?
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
I was talking about what you could wear!
Who?
ON TELEVISION!!  Cut the shit, will you!
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
You never know who you'll see.
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
You still in love?
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that.
Where are you going?
I have to leave now.
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
No, that should be more than --
Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.
You don't exactly look like drug dealers.
Of what?
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
Beer, please.
Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
You told me how to do it!
We don't know which Buick, do we?
Well, why'd you shoot him?
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him.
Should I kill him now?
Wait. Any last words, General Lee?
You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...
Joyce was screwing Del.
...among others.
So what the fuck's a Finn?
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
I don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it.
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
I'm not telling.
What?
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
Well... I think I saw her soul.
You need to remember who you're talking to...
A doctor on the show... why?
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
I said 'got it?'
You made your point...  I was wrong.
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
No, I said to follow 'my' instincts. Now, we go up there and conclude our business. Case closed.
Betty was a lovely child.
Oh, five years, give or take.
It is, if you like idiots...
You better believe it.
He's waiting...
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
Can I have an evil twin?
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Yeah? The sport utility?
Uh-huh.
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
Yeah. Why, you know him?
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
She's a lesbian.
I swear to God!
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
"A Reason to Love."
Huh?
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
Gopher, Everett?
You mis'able little sneak thief...
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!
Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
Do not seek the treasure!
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
Good Lord, what do we do?
Fire! I hate fire!
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
Izzat right?
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
Oh my God!
He was never turned into a frog!
Everett, my beard itches.
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
Assa good idea, Pappy.
Campaign manager? Waldrip.
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
In any state.
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Suckin' away.
Helluva awgazation.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Pullin' ah pants down...
Wipin' little circles with his bread...
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
Not out the other side his face, though.
Oh no, no, just the reg'la side -
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
No weddin'.
- in the gods - Huh?
That's not my ring.
Not your...
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
Well, we need that ring.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
Yes, but honey -
That wasn't my doing...
Well sure, honey, but...
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
The hell you say! Wash is kin!
Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
You didn't know that at the time!
So I borrowed it till I did know!
That don't make no sense!
Pete, don't be ignorant-
Million point two.
Isn't it, uh...
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.
I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
I am. Hur you?
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
Well I guess folks don't mind they's integrated.
He ain't our daddy!
You got a maiden name, Daddy?
He's a suitor!
Buyin' nipples!
Yes, Sir.
Well, that's how long I've been out at sea.
Okay, okay. You win.
Thank you, sir!
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Wha-chu-say, palequero? Short time, long time, only ten dolla.
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
Nobody. It just came to me.
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
When did this happen?
A long time ago.
I don't mean anything by it.
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
Get into your fatigues, Mayo. Before the weekend's out, you'll quit.
Why? Because you can do it alone?
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
Pity you don't have the character.
Yes, sir!
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
It's important, sir!
Well, goodbye.
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
How're you doing, Sarge?
Pardon?
I called you Sarge.
Before that.
No, sir!
No, sir.
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
Where are you from, boy?
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Zack, don't!
Louder!
He was. He died.
Vietnam?
Yeah.
We don't have to talk at all.
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
How late?
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
What?
One more minute.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
Come on. Let's go dance.
I got my foot on the floor.
But in what ways?
I haven't made up my mind.
I do.
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
No, and I'm not looking for one either.
Yeah? Why're you here?
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
My kinda group!
He didn't give you much choice.
There's always a choice.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
Any time, sailor.
It sure was.
I don't want you to move.
They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
Hey, will you just leave me alone?
Are those for me?
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
Your real father?
So?
Why'd he do it?
I don't know where that is.
Because he's my friend, too.
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
Hey, Sid, thanks.
It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart.
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
Sure.
Yeah.
A little.
No problem, but who's Susan?
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
Do you know that for sure?
It's mine.
Not with me.  Not with people.
Peace out.
She didn't.
Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
The fuck did you do that for?!
That's right.
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
Yes.
Remember that.
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
Two.  Squeeze harder.
I can't just...
Th --
You got an idea?
Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
She better.
That's their problem.
Not that one.
NOT THAT ONE?!
She's got your gun, that's what she's thinking!  The FUCK you had to bring a gun for?!
FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
I know.
They're not supposed to be here!
This was your department, Junior.
They're not supposed to be here!
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
Fourteen business days.  Escrow is always business days.
You're an idiot.
This is insane.  I'm outta here.
So we keep an eye on her.  Raoul can totally administrate that part.
Raoul, what in God's name do we do if she has a gun?
I did.
They're gonna die in there!
Shit!
Hey.
And we're never getting in.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
Jesus, what was I thinking?
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
I mean it!
Adios.
Everything okay?
I don't get it.
Can we come in?
What do you want?
We'd like to come in.
No, you can't come in.
You don't look so good.
Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!
Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
Not at all.
I said open the door.
It's okay, Raoul.
No fucking way.
The hell we are.
Nobody leaves.
Observe.
How many more do we have after this?
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
What?
Why?
Ever read any Poe?
The furniture guy?
Got us in here, didn't I?
Shoulda got an apartment.
478...
0150.
Fuck her too.
That room!
What?!
PANIC ROOM!
It doesn't work?!
What do they want?
I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
Wait.
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
Feel okay?
Yeah.
Shaky?
Nope.
Chills?
Huh uh.
They're coming in here, aren't they?
No, I told you, they can't.  It's not a possibility.
Get the fuck out of my house!
Give me a break.
Little bit.  Yeah.
Don't though. 
What am I, a five year old?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
I don't know, why?
To prove he wasn't chicken.
YOU HAVE TO!
I'm here.  I'm here.
On the floor!  Get on the floor!
Come on, come on...
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
Close it!
On it!
He WILL.
I'm sorry.
Why?
Not an option.
Oh shit Alma... you're...
Fuck that, we've got company...
What are doing with yours?.
Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.
Damn straight...  Let's go check out these Paper Panthers.
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
Yeah, I do, but he's gotta cool it...
Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
Sure, those boojie jokers don't do anything except print up a lotta paper saying "Black is Beautiful."
Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
Yeah you do. It's up to you either here or downtown.
What's with you?
Yeah, it's me.
Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
You know it. Stay Black...
Damn straight.
No Fuck you!!!
Look this is bull...
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
Party needs the bread.  Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!
No man. PE -- "political education."
Not yet, one of these day's maybe. Bobby's party chairman. Political Education's really his bag.
Cy... I ain't even sure.
Naw... I gotta...
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
You talk as if this thing's already been decided.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
Yes sir, I did.
Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
Yeah... Bobby you gotta...
Alone...
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
So what's the deal?
Yeah... let me think about it.
Right on Brother Judge...
Brimmer.
Well, act like it. Come on.
What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
Fuck maybe... be there.
Anything happens to Huey it ain't gonna be a finger. I'll...
Nothing.
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
Later for that. I'm done either way...
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Where is he?.
Ain't no one seen him.
Why didn't you tell me?
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
You don't even know it man, but you're a god damn hero.
You don't look alright.
Yeah... cop hit me...
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
I don't know. I really don't.
It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
Good.
Late summer.
Congratulations.
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
It's a start.
That would be nice.
I expect to try.
Pride will do.
You got me beat on both accounts.
The hell I do.
As do you.
Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed.
I said, I'm not my sister.
Do you?
Of course, I do.
Very well, then.
Goodbye.
Yes, sir.
What unit?
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
Who cared for your wounds?
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
As you wish.
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
I consider them linked.
Sir?
Sir.
Most certainly.  Arrange it.
Perhaps.
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
When I have children, I hope I don't hide behind them.
Not yet.  What happened?
You're in no condition to ride.
I have no choice, I...
It's already over.
It's safer if we stay together.
Yes, sir.  My father taught me.
He tried.  It didn't take.
Yes...  ... father.
You know how old I am.
God help us all when you're forty.
I didn't see any.
And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
Pride is his weakness.
She got me at a more impressionable age.
I don't believe it... and I wasn't there for it...
Granted.  Where are you going?
Cheraw Falls.
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
She is.  Don't go in there.
You know what happened.
No, I don't.
And what do they know?
That's not enough.  Tell me.
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
You don't hate him.
Thirteen years...
That's a damn long time...
... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
You said bribery twice...
Gabriel.
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
I am, I think.
What are my orders?
Long time.
Not held, just slowed down.
How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
How many men have we seen die?
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
Goodbye, Harry.
Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
Robert.  Robert E. Lee.
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
Four, five miles.
No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads.  We're safer here.
Leave him.  Take care of William and Susan.
For what?
Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one of that sort.
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
Earned.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
I've had no sons to lose, nor daughters.  I lose the sons of other men.
That bad?
Worse.
When?
But father, they might come this way.
Put them away.
Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
I'm glad I killed them... I'm glad...
It's a place where the dead speak, Missy.
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
Is that right, dad?
In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.
Ellie...Ellie...what...
He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.
I will. Come and kiss me.
Yaay!
Yayyy!
Well, I thought it was safe--
For a little while.
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
Yes.
Because you promised.
I know.
No more chocolate chip cookies.
Huh?
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
Oh, faith's a little more than just believing.
I'm sure you're not.
Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
I swear.
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
Not at all.
Allman Brothers.
What?
Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
I don't know.
Yes, but--
Then come on.
You'll see before long. Let's go.
Ayuh.
This time I mean it.
Whose burying ground?
Your cairn.
Don't worry about that.
Jud, why am I doing all this?
Because it's right.
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
This babe has said enough.
It's Ellie's cat.
Nope. He's your cat now.
I'm thinking about going to bed.
Shit! Look at this mess!
Ayuh--it's a mess, all right.
And because the dead walked.
Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
Remember.
Louis, the house is beautiful.
Come on--let's parole 'em.
Jesus, the road!
It's beautiful!
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
I just said--
I got eggs down here!
Good d--
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
I'm sure.
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
That boat is my livelihood!
Aye, aye, sir!
She.  Goes.  Free.
You can't.  I can.
Elizabeth goes free!
We got that part.  Anything else?
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
Wait as long as you like.
You can go to your grave not knowing.
All right then.
That so?
Men!  Are you up for it?
Now.  No, don't kill him.
And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
Now, none of that.  Please dig in.
Would that I could.
It's a pirate medallion.
Boy overboard!
I'm a bit nervous, myself --
One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
You're speaking up for him again?
That would hardly be proper.
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.
Women in London must have learned to not breathe.
About the day we met. Do you remember?
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.
Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
-- then we never would have met.
I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
Me!
You're in league with Barbossa!
No, I'm -- rescuing you.
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.
What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
To the Black Pearl.
She can hold a bit longer.
Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
I know.  That was for the smell.
That we are.
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
I don't think that will be necessary.
Sorry, I didn't know.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
Smith.
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
I knew you'd listen to reason!
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
Only a little.
Pirate.
Move!
Where does it make berth?
Because you're a pirate.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
Never.  They took Miss Swann.
How?  The key's run off.
Agreed!
We need to go!
Good.
Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
It's still against the law.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
My father.  William Turner?
I swear, you look just like him.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
My father -- was not -- a pirate!
Depends.
On what?
I'll lead them away.
Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
It's the right way.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
No, it's not.
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
You've seen it?
Yes.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
Yes, I have.
No.
He's not telling the truth.
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
Where did he come from?
A moment.
But --
Please.
Dr. Bright has escaped.
Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation.
You don't have to give it to us because Dr. Nebbleman can just cut it out of him.
No, thank you.
Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.
You're lacking a few things too: ethics, morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant.
Ain't it.
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
You think you can use me to stop the meltdown.
She says it's not.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
That remains to be seen.
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
Icarus, please!  This is important!
Then you still love me?
Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
I'm so excited, Icarus.
What I asked you earlier?
Poppy, this is not the time!
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them.
The trunk.
In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do.
You don't want this.
Yeah, I do!
Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
Well, you got another problem.
The replicators?
This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
You're looking for a urine sample.
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
No!  Well, not those exact words.
Who isn't?
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
Like Crazy Glue?
So, I guess it worked.
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
Been out for six months now.
Really?  What have you been doing?
You know, this and that.
Same old Daniel.
The big house.
A cage by any other name would still smell like sweaty ugly men.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
Sure.  Can I ask you one more thing? You haven't published anything in a while.  How come?
That's what I thought.
We'll see?  What does that mean?
Susan, this is the future of America here.
Daniel, what are you doing here?
Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
No, something is really wrong... look!
The nanobot.
Mouse?  What mouse?
What happened to it?
I don't know.
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
We don't?
What do these replicators do to people?
Isn't it already too late then?
No, no, I just feel wired!
What?  What's wrong?
What about it!
Just giving credit where credit is due.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!
Yeah.  Old times.
I'm glad you came to me for help.
Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
The nanobot... it's not here...
It's still inside me?
I don't know.
Something else I want to try.
Getting used to it.
Like a glove.
On the counter.
You didn't think I could just leave you?
Argon's private lab.
Let's go.
Did you think I could just leave you...?
We've got to get the nanobot.
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
You mean he's polymerized, like me?
I have to!
God, what a fight that was.
We were different people then.
I guess they do.
Oh yes you are!
Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
Yeah, and what might that be?
An ass-beating.  Would you like yours first, Mr. Sim?
It's a miracle.
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
And you have him?
We lost him.
You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
Don't worry, four eyes.
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
You don't seem to understand that this one's different. He has brains.
Yes - isn't it.
Goodbye, Stew
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
I don't mind her if you don't.
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
Certainly. Right over there.
You're all right.
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
No - give you another guess.
Sure, I'll take a chance.
For what?
For the letters, of course.
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
Of course I am Stewart.
Now let's get this settled
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live
Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
Yes - isn't it?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
Good morning. What does this mean?
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
Oh, hello Mother!
Mother!
Look! Look! The front page!
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening
Well, I got a seat, but I have no place to put it.
Yeah, hello. How are you?
Thanks, I will.
Well, I should say!
Yale '21, I believe.
Huh?
As one Tribune man to another
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
All right, all right, don't mention it.
Give my regards to your managing editor.
I certainly will.
I'm afraid.
Hey, make up your mind, will you?
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
Yeah, little Gloria.
Well - it's only April.
Come on, get going, get going!
No? Well, where were you when that happened?
Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
That's so.
My play.
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
Sure.
Araby, my eye!
No?
No!
Your valet, sir.
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
I beg your pardon, sir?
Outside!
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
Yes, of course. I'll get it for you
Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
and those and them.
And the rest of us are truck horses?
There you go, talking like a woman!
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
I hope you'll be very happy.
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
How is her family going to feel about it?
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
My mistake - she's glaring.
Must be my wife.
Hello, Stew.
Hello, Hank. How are you?
Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
To Old Madrid.
Never even been to New Madrid.
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Did Conrad draw on his imagination?
Conrad.
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
Yeah?
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
What did he want?
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
Oh I see, but Gloria doesn't seem to be satisfied with the twenty thousand dollars.
We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
I have it here.
Good.
You quit trying to stop anybody
Well, at best you might deny it.
Holy jumping swordfish!
I suppose you know why I came?
Thanks. May I sit down?
You don't.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
Sure.
Hello, Joe.
Double strength!
"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"
They've been ready for the last half hour.
I have. Double-strength!
Get out of here.
Yes - the worm!
I beg your pardon?
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
Heavens! The man's insane!
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
You try it.
Yeah.
Found no skeletons?
No, sir.
It's haunted just the same.
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
Yeah?
What do you mean?
It doesn't matter.
No. I want to know.
... Sex.
Ah.
What?
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
I'm fine.
In my handbag.
Looks just like it did.
And they won't be able to tell?
No ... They won't be able to tell.
What?
Sure.
I had to say goodbye.
Thanks ... I love you.
I love you too.
Hello Bill.
I'm sorry ...
No, no ... Come on in.
Thanks.
I think it looks nice.
Well ...  Here's what it's s'posed to look like.
Bud brought it to me.
Bud?
Here's my favorite.
I've got to go ...
It's alright.
No ...
I don't know.
But I really should get home.
Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
All night?
Sure you are.
No I'm not.
It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
I don't want to put on some make up ...
I don't want it to go away.
I'm gonna go now.
Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
Oh yeah.
... Lover's Lane.
Lover's Lane!
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
It is?
Trust me ...
What are you doing?
It's six-thirty ...
So.
We were gonna ... You know ...
Why not?
With what?
It's better, Mary Sue.
I don't believe it.
What's the matter?
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
No it couldn't!
Oh, no thanks ...
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
I'm fine--but thank you.
Real rain?
Yes I did.
Yes I do.
The basketball team?
You're not allowed to lie.
I'm not lying ... Here I'll show you.
Why am I out of order?
Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
What is it?
Hello Mr. Simpson.
Hear your Dad got a new car.
Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
Yes.
The other one?
What are you doing?
Yeah. Every episode ever.
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It doesn't work without a remote.
No way.
YOU get lost!
What happened?
I'm not sure.
I don't know.
What's going to happen?
Neither do I.
Just take deep breaths.
We're supposed to be in school.
Owns the hardware store.
To who?
Does he--you know--like "me"?
As a matter of fact he does.
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
Can we do any better?
I don't think so.
I got lost.  Oh here ... look at this!
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
He won't notice anyway.
What do you mean?
So what's the point?
Jen please ...
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
Well if I don't who will?
They're happy like this.
Really? It seems so fattening.
Not directly anyhow ...
It's fine.
Nothing?
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
I told you. I'm like positive.
This thing works. We could go home right now.
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
Right here.
And you're sure about this?
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
No. I baked them for you.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
No. I baked them for you.
Oh ... Hi.
... Lover's Lane?
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
You don't know?
What?
Out there.
What's that like?
Hunh?
Rain.
Real rain?
Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
We'll just put up the top.
It was a prop for the school play ...
Sure ...
I'm not sure.
No I won't. I swear.
I like it too.
Marmalade.
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
Well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?
Nice ... Nice ...
McGinty's.
Because we don't belong!
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
... Hi.
Well c'mere, young fella.
What?
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
Oh--well ...
NOW!
Oh no? Let me show you something!
EXCUSE ME?
JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!
I'm going to leave now.
Because you're coming home.
I'm sorry. I can't do that.
Much less than that.  An hour and a half.
This is TV pal. They don't fool around.
I understand.
What?
... Yeah.
Have you cooked the burgers?
Yes.
Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early.
Yeah ...
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
Oh ... Okay.  ... But I really liked it.
... What's that?
Christmastime.
Hi.
Open it.
Just a little--You know.
TV repair?
Yeah. TV busted?
Yeah ...
Well here I am.
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
A miracle.
Hey.
Yeah ... Saw you too.
Cool.
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
Yeah but what are you doing?
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
So you can't talk to me?
Well, I can't talk though --
And what was this?
Somewhere in Utah.
What's the listing?
D&D Mattress Man.
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
So you're coming tonight, right?
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
I don't think I'm going to the party.
...please, I just don't want it....
I'm trying to be your friend.
I know.
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
Did I say that?
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
You look nervous.
I'm not, I'm very happy.
Why?
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
It's fine, but --
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
I feel really on the spot now.
Are you gonna do it?
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
You're being weird again, see. Come on. Please don't be weird.
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
It's not mine.
Why's it here?
I have no idea.
Call me later.
You're so scared.
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
I....please don't do this.
I just want to know where she's staying.
Hi, is this Jack?
Yes.
This is Georgia.
Hi. This is Jack.
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
Where are you?
I'm in my bedroom.
Are you watching a porno movie?
Sure.
...just talking to you....
Are your pants off?
No.
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
Yeah....you're married aren't you, Jack?
You have a girlfriend?
...yes...
Where is she?
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
...yeah....well you have me now.
You sound very cute, very nice.
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
I'm fine. Who is this?
Georgia.
Hi....what....what's up....?
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
You don't even know how much it is.
I know but I....how much is it?
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
You have trouble, financial trouble?
I thought you had your own business. You said you were gonna diversify and all that stuff....
No. I'm sorry.
We got disconnected before....
I need help.
I know I did. But I don't.
You lied to me?
I didn't lie.
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
No you won't.
Are you telling me no?
They're not open yet?
They don't get opened until eight.
Do you know them.
Hi.
Yeah, not really.
I saw a picture of you.
No. I'm the exact opposite --
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
Yeah.
....Hi.....
It's Barry.
About six months.
You like her?
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
You were talking about the promotion --
You see?
Yeah, no, I see --
....No....
No I didn't say that.
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Yes.
What happened?
Nothing.
What did he want?
Nothing.
Did something happen; are you alright?
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
Are you learning how to play it?
Yes? I'm trying.
Oh that's great.
...yeah...
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
You don't think you'll go --
I don't know.
This is Lena.
Hi.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'll see you later.
What do you mean?
I don't freak out.
Ok.
Have a good trip.
Thank you.
Lena?
Yeah?
It's Barry.
I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
I just wanted to make sure.
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
yeah.
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
It's so nice.
Yeah.
What's that? What is that that you're doing?
Yeah.
For what?
For work.....
I think maybe over a hundred.
It's ok to ask that.
I thought that you were anyway.
I'm fine are you ok?
Yes I'm sorry.
What is this?
Let's go to the hospital.
I'm sorry.
You can't do that.
Ok.
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
I'm fine, I have your work number.
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
Ok, bye, bye.
Bye.
Did you do it?
No.
Well who did?
I don't know.
You're hand is bleeding.
I cut myself.
How?
On my knife.
Why? ...what?
Your hand is bleeding.
I know.
Please don't do this to me.
The police are on their way.
Hello, how are you?
Hi, is this your first time calling?
Yes it is.
What do you mean?
And your name?
Barry Egan.
And your Social Security number.
What's that for?
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
No one will know your name.
Can you say that my name is Jack?
You want her to call you Jack?
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
I'll say whatever I want --
Thank you.
I think you have a call?
I didn't know you had a sister?
....I have seven.
Hi Walter.
How's business?
Maybe you said that because you're hungry.....
Well I'm sorry. Before...
Mhm.
Ok. You're connected.
No, no, no, no, nO, NO, NO!
Hey...Lance....can I.....
You ok?
Yes I'm fine.
Why you wearin' a suit?
That's not a piano.....I have a piano at home.....where'd you get it?
...it just....I don't know....I don't know.
Hi, Lance.
Let's just leave it there for now.
...I'll tell you later.
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
That's funny.
Hi.
How much money do you have in your pockets?
Just take it, take the money in my pockets, take it, it's fine --
Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have....
Yes.
Is this where you live?
Yes.
Are you serious with this?
Yes. Sorry.
Well....what do you want, then?
I'm sorry, I know. I know that it's....
Are you going to the party tonight?
Yes I am.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Right now, you're doing nothing?
What time are you gonna be there?
You can't be late.
I won't.
I'm serious.
I know.
Seriously.
You can't be late though.
I know.
Seriously.
I know.
Yeah but I'm serious.
Ok.
I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.
Don't puss out.
When can you leave?
As soon as you want.
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
That's it.
I'm only paying two of you guys.
What's the problem?
Nothing.
Put him through.
Shut up, just put him on the phone, it doesn't matter, just shut up --
Are you sure?
Yeah.
I'm sorry. You're right.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
Should I call you later?
I'll just see you when you get back here.
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
They've the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide.
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
We've still a few lone incurables. Prone to violence, to perversion.
No one's forcing you to listen.
Once or twice.
Then what's he doing here?
I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
Now give the signal.
"...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."
We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
Yes, Abbe?
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
"Turn you out?"
Mother's not half so blind as you.
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
Mustn't do that, sir.
I must grant him his last rites.
You'd deny a dying man his salvation?
It's not even noon --
What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
And --?
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
Mightier than the sword indeed.
Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
You always do.
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
THEN BUGGER ME!
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
Because your writing continues, unchecked.
What on earth would that require?
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
Coulmier, you animal!
I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
Your words drove Bouchon to --
I saw the longing in your eye --
-- that was lust --
-- the passion in your heart --
I know, because I felt it myself --
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
AND DID YOU?
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
Was it impotence?
NEVER!
Then it must've been love --
I'm here.
His wife's?
Well...?
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
He's sworn to obedience.
Of course.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
No. It most certainly was not.
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
You'd suffer in her stead?
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
And my own.
How is the patient faring?
Poorly.
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
Sweet, then? Like the pastry?
Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rou!
Was ever a man more risqu? He wants to take me every way!
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
I'll fill every slippery hollow; if you're obliging, then you'll swallow!
Come now, darling, give it a read.
"Well worth the dig!"
Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
Don't start --
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
I've just the story... inspired by these very surroundings....
Is it terribly erotic?
Fiendishly so.
Oh, you. You talk same as you write.
You demand a lot from your readers, you do.
It's only been described to me. In your books.
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
You could whisper it through the walls of your cell.
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
"By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..."
No. But tell him I would.
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
My schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
What thought is that?
-- words alone are insufficient.
And I in yours.
....shame on you, truly...
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
But it's just begun --
Do as I say.
Very much.
You prefer a book to your husband's company?
No, when I was but a tender lad--
Last week would this be?
Not you too
You're just scared.
Am I?
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
Don't insult me with your cute press quotes Save it for Louella.
You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
Sure you can, just--
He needs me here.
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
But I am That's the killer, honey.
My name is Orson Welles
And director.
Randolph!
Oh, why is that?
Why is that, Louis?
Bel Air is restricted.
There's no call for that language-
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
It's not really--
How much?
Yes.
I am not that woman.
There's nothing to explain
You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
You needn't use that language with me
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
There's a different between want and
Not for me.
You are repellant when you drink.
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
You are slovenly and unattractive and I won't  t-t-t-tolerate it.
I will not have this in my home.
I just want to understand--
Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
Please be quiet.
And how do you feel when you are lied to?
I can't remember the lines!
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
No -- no -- I mean--
I wanna see the picture today
That's right
Uh-huh
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
You are talking to him.
Forget it-
What are movies about?
Nope.
Showing life
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
But with compassion and insight--
Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
Who the hell's Manolete?
The great Spanish bullfighter
I don't wanna write about no spic.
The old man has his own way of doing things
Orson, please ... it's too bright
Please don't say this.
Mank-
Fuck you
I expected more from you.
Sorry to disappoint.
Listen to me-
Fuck you--
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
She was . . . innocent
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
It is 350 pages of ... ABSOLUTE INSPIRATION!
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
But it's not a great syllable
I just can't . . see it anymore
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
I don't care.
Jews. She's talking about Jews.
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
George...
Of course, of course. How can we be of service?
That's for me to decide.
You're going to destroy it
Yes
You talked to Mr. Swanbeck?
Get out
Pardon?
CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
It's the safe bet, Orson. There's nothing wrong with that.
Ah, it's a grand title.
They've all seen a rough cut
When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray.
Well it' s all you've got !
No, we're jake. But listen-
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.
I don't want to sit
It was the best, kid
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
Without me. I'm afraid. I got the axe this morning.
Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
We done?
Yeah.
Yes!
He's Christ?
I'm Christ
Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
We're from...
About what?
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
It's not done.
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
None of your fuckin' business.
Nothing...
What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
Sure. What is it?
Hit me in the face.
You want me to do what?
You heard me, I said hit me.
Here's your glove.
Jack! Enough!
Go ahead.
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
Whadda you care?
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
You wasn't with her?
With her? How?
C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna get outa here tonight.
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
How many times do I have to hit her? I hit her enough.
Give me a chance. Let me look.
Say what you're gonna say.
You want the title shot or not?
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
What did Tommy say?
C'mon, Joey.
G'wan, do it.  Protect yourself, rummy.
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
Where you been?
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
What?
What do you mean, "you"?
So what?
Did you ever fuck my wife?
Whatsa matter with you?
Maybe it wasn't you, but you know what I'm talkin' about.
Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
What time is it?
Nine o'clock.
At night?
Yeah. At night.
Three more, I figure.
Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Should I hit it?
Just give it a nice little tap.
No.
That's all right. He don't mind.
It's OK.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
Jake...
Do what I say.
Now take your panties off.
Oh, Jake.
What do you mean, "good looking?"
But, Jake, I was just...
Who asked you?
I was just...
Who asked you?
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
You're not interested in him?
No, I'm not.
What?
You asleep?
Yeah.
Huh?
Yeah, what?
That he's got a pretty face.
I never noticed his face.
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
I took the kids to my sister's.
I called. You weren't there.
I got bored so I went to the movies.
I went to the movies.
What'd you see?
"Father of the Bride."
What was it about?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
You're a fuckin' liar.
Yeah, I sucked his cock.
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
What?
Then what?
I don't know.
Why don't you just call him?
I dunno.
Ok, all right. Telephone's in the hall. Dial his number.
Sure, what else is new?
No. Open the door.
All right, just don't make any noise.
Don't make no difference no more.
Jake, sit down for a minute.
Never felt better.
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
He should.
Yeah, the weight's Ok.
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
Right, the gym.
I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
Oh. When are they expected home?
He has it. Thank you.
Goodnight.
I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
Name me a better photographer.
But his leg!
Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
All right -- you don't believe me.
She never left the apartment --
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
What time?
Six ayem.
Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
Not yet.
Who left -- where?
The Thorwalds -- at six in the morning?
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
Your logic is backward.
Tom, I've got something real big for you.
Your Lisa?
Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
For what?
For getting rid of that cast.
Who said I was getting rid of it?
With that cast on -- you don't.
You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Next time, have some good news.
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
It's me.
Something wrong?
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
Did you get my note?
Who are you?
Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
Well, I only quote from the best.
How?
You've got a hormone deficiency.
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
That's normal.
I don't want to.
That's abnormal.
She's only perfect.
Intelligence! Nothing has caused the human race more trouble. Modern marriage!
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
And some man will lose his.
He and his wife splitting up?
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
But it takes a particularly low type of man to do it.
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
In this heat?  They're up now.
Get back there! He'll see you!
You called the police?
I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.
I have a feeling we've just begun.
What?
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
Got a shovel?
No.
Now wait a minute --
There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
Smart? She'll be arrested!
That'll get her out of there, won't it?
To bail Lisa out of jail.
How much do you think you'll need?
First offense burglary --  -- probably two-fifty.  The piggy bank.
Mrs. Doyle?
Not yet, Jeff.
You haven't even heard from him?
Not a word.
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
And your stomach?
Empty as a football.
And you love life?
Not too active.
Uh-huh.
Only because it's expected of her.
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
Going on right here. It's a big night.
Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.
Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.
Tired?
She looked very cool. She had on a mint green --
That's good news.
How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
Make the one you want.
You mean leave the magazine?
Yes.
For what?
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
How can you tell that -- from here?
Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?
Right now, it doesn't seem so.
You mean "goodnight."
I mean what I said.
Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
I have one now.
So do I.
Tell me about it.
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
Something too frightful to utter.
What is it you're looking for?
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
There's nothing to see.
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
125 West Ninth Street.
To get on home.
All right -- but what's he doing now?
I don't know.
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
It doesn't make sense to me.
What doesn't?
Women aren't that unpredictable.
Lisa -- I can't guess what you're thinking.
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
You'll have to clear that through my landlord --
Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --
I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
Staying the night here, uninvited.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Exactly what I had in mind -- along with some brandy.
Who was the trunk addressed to?
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
Thank you.
He's washing down the bathroom walls.
Too close.
Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
Phone number?
A new disease.
Friend of yours?
I'm glad they let you out.
Nobody chickened.
What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
Give me some dirt.
Good luck, Buzz.
What?
You watch too much television.
I'm cute, too.
What?
Chicken?
Somebody find him a knife.
Know the Millertown bluff?
Stay there.
Buzz Gundersen.
Glad to meet you.
Okay.
I like you, you know?
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
We got to do something.  Don't we?
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
Smashed the front door.
Any other entrance?
Down in back.
No--
I think I should go home.
No.  We're going to bring him down.
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
You clean out of your head?  Come on!
Hang loose.  We got all night.
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
You still want to go home, Moose?
Hold it, Jim.
You can't protect me.
You make any sandwiches?
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
Yeah!
Yeah!  Shh!
That's funny!
Yes.
What would you do, Dad?
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
Well--
Will you wait a minute?
You don't want me to go.
I don't want to learn that!
Sure.  Sure.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
No--thanks, very much, Mr. Stark.
I think I know my son.
I was talking to Jim.
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
What's that pounding?
Are you going down there?
I still think you should go down.
Open it.
No, honey.  No, he's not here.
Yes, sir.
Come with me, John.
Well maybe she better start.
I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
In my mother's drawer.
I'll wait for him.
Hi there.
You remember me?
No.  I don't think so--
I'm sorry--I made a mistake.
What?
What?
Jim.  What's yours?
Plato.  It's a nickname.
I just don't want trouble.
He has a knife.
They're still there!
Who knows.  Plato?
What?
What's a chickie-run?
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
No.  It's okay.
O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
Who's that!
It's me!
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
They're looking for you!--
Yeah?
Help me in!
I'm here.  Shut up.
Come out come out wherever you are!
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
No.  I'm scared.
Wow!  Well now-there-then!
There's only one key.
We'll take it!
Come on!
I'm what?  What?
Hey!  How 'bout that!
Not lately.
When was that?
Get away from me!
I'm here.
I know.  Light a match, will you?
I'm fine.
Why?
What do you think?
I need it.
They like you.  Okay?
Come on!
Just a guard.
I shot at one of them.
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
All right, darling.
It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--
Goodbye, dear.
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
Why should you be the only one.
Just tell a little white lie?
No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
Do I have to spell it out?
Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
Wash up and go home.
No.
I don't know why--!
And your folks didn't understand?
They never do.
So then you moved?
What?
If he could--
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
Listen--
Bully for you.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
Now that's true!
See?
See, I'm new.
You're really flipped--aren't you.
You going there?
Yeah--why--
Dig the square wardrobe!
University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
Oh.
Goodbye!  See you!
I'm not so bad.
You were looking for me, weren't you?
No--I was just--maybe--
I'm numb.
I'm getting that way, too.
Sure.  Lots of times.
Awful?  No.  It's just lonely. It's the loneliest time.
I felt like it.
Your lips are soft when you kiss.
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
I feel as if I'm walking under water.
There's just one thing.  What about--
See, we're very modern.
I bet you hear everything I say!
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
How many rooms do you think there are?
Should we explore?
Hi.
Are you?
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
You smell like baby powder.
So do you.
I never felt so clean before.
We have to go back!
Yes.  My best friend.
What's he like?
Hi.
He hates me.
What?
He hates me.
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
Do you think your father means that?
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
Would you like to go home if we can arrange it?  Did you notify the parents?
You said you'd call my father.
Goodbye, Judy.  Take it easy.
Are you and Mom home tonight?
No.  Why?
Hi.
What?
I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
Girls don't love their father? Since when?  Since I got to be sixteen?
Gabriel, what are you doing!
Read a lot about you, Nick.
What are you doing here?!
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
A man of some travels.
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
Don't hurt him...
YES!!!
No, baby. He wants me.
...whoever she is.
Searching for a money man...
That's a book, baby.  That's a book of love.
I've been doing good, though.
What, he should see me help you catch him?
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
We sell children's toys --
Radio said negative five.
Negative five?
Radio said.
No, hey, I like your coat --
Saw me --
No, no, no. Be like you want to be.
One more. Smile. One more.
No, c'mon --
Yes it was all you --
Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
Then he shoulda signed his name.
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
Beauty and fragrances.
Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho ho ho.
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
We could live it up and --
Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work.
No, lover. I'll see what you can do.
NICK!
Nick, no --
You sold him out.
Nick --
JESUS CHRIST!
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
You're not hearing me here --
Nick, please, it's me --
You told him about Nick's letters.
No, Nick, no --
You're in on this.
I love you!
Canada.
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
Nick...
Get your own room.
Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
Nick, the ice is --
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
Don't say my name...
I love you, Nick...
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
What?
We'll need one.
I'm almost done.
He says he wants it now.
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
They all are. Football's on.
Keep 'em there for a little while.
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
Yeah. That's love.
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
You shouldn't have.
What are you talking about?
You said it a million times!
I never told you my name.
The hell I can't.
I shared his cell!
But you were saying you were...
She says a lot of things.
A girl says she loves you, you say something.
What?
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
What's her middle name?
Samantha.
What'd they call her in college?
What college.
Where'd she drop her cherry?
A station wagon in Canada.
What's her greatest fear?
Her brother.
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
No. It's her brother.
Hey.
The hell you don't.
Five million?
This isn't the Tomahawk.
What the fuck are you talking about.
And I worked there. For a year.
Why not.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
More than you know.
Might as well be.
Don't have Weather Channel in the Mountain, Nick.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
I'm gonna need some money.
...ttt..tt... two out of three?
Nnn... nothing...
NO!
Nick. I been trying to hit you.
You need six.
No way.
I'm no threat without a gun.
No, you're not.
Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.
'Tis the season, convict.
What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
How'd you know my name.
Where is he?! Where is he?!
OPEN IT!!!
Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
What?
We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations!
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
Acid-chewer.
His lips went next. You ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?
Fuckin' freezing.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
Five years. Since it opened.
How long ago was your makeover?
My what?!
Not with you.
You gotta get someone upstairs.
How do we do that?
Where the hell's Gabriel?
DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
Merlin, I didn't know --
It's a roach, guy --
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
Oh, man --
Fuckin, Zookerman --
Hell you haven't.
Three days, man.
Not yet.
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
And some pecan pie.
Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.
Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
Shoulda written, Rudy...
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Thought you hate your old man.
Standing right here, man!
Alamo...
GUARD!!!
GUARD!!!
Ash... Ashley...
No, man! No, no, no!
Tell her... I'll be there ...
YOU TELL HER!

...for Christmas...
NICK!!!
That was my king!
Well...sorry...
But... I had a five...
You're hitting for MY cards!
What? No...
THEY'LL OPEN ONE!
I'M NOT NICK!
Who the hell made this map.
Since when? What the hell is this room?
They changed the layout.
Now where were we?
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
Fine, now.
I'll call somebody.
Who?
No. She was from Ladora Heights.
How do you know all this?
Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
What?
That's okay, Eddie, I do.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
Who, Mr. White?
Yeah.
Me and Mr. White?
Yeah.
A little.
What about?
The Brewers.
The Milwaukee Brewers?
Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.
It's a scene. Memorize it.
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
What? Snap out of it!
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
Take a seat.
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
How is he?
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
Dead as Dillinger.
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it.
Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya?
Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
Juicy, junior, real juicy.
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
I'm not askin', I'm betting.
He don't believe in it.
You do?
Your name's Freddy something.
Freddy Newendyke.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
I do.  How do I look?
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
I said: "Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite."
Down to my car.
Why?
It's a surprise.
Nice Guy Eddie.
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
Correct.
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
You don't believe in tipping?
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
You really think we were set up?
Why not?
What's wrong with it?
No real people?
Uh-uh, just cops.
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
I got the diamonds.
Where?
I got 'em, all right?
Where? Are they out in the car?
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
He ain't dead.
So what is it?
I think he's just passed out.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
Don't fuckin' patronize me.
If we don't, he'll die.
We don't think this place is safe.
What are you gonna do about him?
Yeah, those guys too.
Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
Nobody. The light was bad.
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
And one of 'em is sick.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
As far as -- Sonora?
Just about.
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
Where do you keep the can opener?
And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
Go on, there's a good boy.
Yeah.
He's learning his letters.
His letters will keep.
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
We can't stay here!
It's a long walk back to Aspen.
But the rest is right.
Will she be dark or fair?
That's fine.
It's too light yet.
Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
Maybe it's better that way.
You don't mean that Clay.
What?
I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
That's right -- worry about your clothes --
Like I said, I was thinkin' of the horses.
Goodbye, Mary.
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
So did I. They were in it.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
Which ranch?
A little hot.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
At the ranch maybe?
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
And meet him there.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
Swimming.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
There's only two of them now.
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
You better start.
That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
Sure. What other reason would there be?
I just wondered. Let's go.
Kind of sore.
I can't take her with me.
Nobody asked you to.
What's there to be fair about?
I can't take her with me.
Nobody asked you to.
What's there to be fair about?
What's botherin' you, anyway?
I'm sorry. Let's go.
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
If she says anything to them I'll kill her.
Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
Just a thing I was workin' on.
The way you act, it must be something pretty secret.
You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
I like it.
Yes, people make me restless.
Even women?
There aren't any women here.
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
Yeah.
Go ahead.
They went on like I told you.
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
I don't like to see you go.
And we're running out of that.
There's still tomorrow morning.
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
We don't want to go there.
He certainly could. About a month.
What are you waiting for? Do something.
How many ways can a man say no.
You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
What's the use.
Maybe you are. I'm not.
Who brought you here?
Where is he?
I don't know -- I don't know.
What for?
He can wait. Let's stay here until morning.
Yeah, we sure have.
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
Lookin' around.
I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
Maybe I could start you out.
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
Good night, Steve.
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
Okay. A-B-C -- D-E-F -- G-H-I --
No. We're not stayin' --
Then I know my alphabet.
Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
What do they look like?
How about California?
I was doin' both. Here.
Oh, sure.
Let me do that.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
If you need me, I'll be --
That's always tough. How long were you together?
I found a picture of his wife.
Ha! Right bitch!
Alex, what are you doing?
Do I know you?
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
That's it.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Okay... maybe that would be best.
Would you die already?!
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
No, you don't understand. It's here in these statues...
What?! What is it, a monster?!
Hey, I have an idea...
It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
You sure?
Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
He's so brave.
No. I never date outside my race.
I meant you're into ghosts.
Okay. See you later, friend.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Okay.
Shhh!
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
It looks like the furnace.
Let's get outta here.
Shit!
No. Try a little higher.
No. Keep rubbing.
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this.
I know, but I've been thinking --
Listen to me I --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Then what are we going to do?
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
Yeah.  Can I borrow five bucks?
I don't care. You pick.
Hot dogs.
I think so.
So, whatever happened to her?
She killed herself a week before he died.
But he'll kill her!
Oh, right.
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
Yeah, I broke my fall.
I'm Hanson the caretaker.
Thanks. I made them by hand.
No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
Made you say it!
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
Yes!!!!
Just wait, you'll see.
We have to destroy him.
My child, you're alive!
Yes, we made it!
We? What do you mean... we?
No, my friends are right here!
Soon, but first I must bless this house.
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
You could use the grade, huh?
Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
Hey, I got an idea.
I told you it would taste just like chicken.
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
Theo, did you see the animal?
There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.
I wouldn't go that far.
Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
Let me see the files.
They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them.
I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.
Are these all the subjects?
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
Remember, Dwight, not a word to anyone.
Professor!
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
Even in the bathroom?
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
No, these are the tapes from the living room. Check this out.
Are you sure it's not the tape?
What is it, Dwight?
Hi.
Just a little experiment.
Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
Oh, I couldn't do that.
Alright. Come on, you guys.
Yours, or the turkeys?
My help?
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
Alright, go to the belt store...
I guess so.
Father, come in, please.
How is she?
Soon. First, I must bless this house.
Then let us prepare.
Because she will lie?
My holy water.
No, I'm fine.
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
Dog, you look hot.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
What does it say?
It says, "Ray."
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
Get out?! What does it say?
Aww. Cool. Dude.
"Fucked me."
"Ray!"
"Fucked me."
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
Bye, bird-brain. See ya, Scotty.
What happened?
Mother? 
0h, shit!
You don't think...
She wouldn't...
That's right up the street! Come on! Just in case!
No more violence... No more violence...
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
He's really cute!
Jeeezzz!
You said you hated him.
No! Stop it! It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die.
I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?
Is there a killer loose?
He certainly drives like a jerk.
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
Because it's the rules!
I don't feel like rewinding it!
She sure can pick 'em!
Thanks, Mom.
Let me see!
Looks good, Mom!
I'm so happy I could shit.
CHIP! You know how much I hate the brown word!
God, Mom!  What's the matter?
But, Chip...
This is so silly. 
You mean for TV or print?
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
Nice?! He should have been executed!
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
Don't I get a kiss?
I love that you're my wife.
You bring me such peace...
Shhhh..
Oooohhhh.
Don't wake the kids...
Ooohhhh!
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
Oohhhhh! Yeah! Yeah!
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. 
Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
What a mess.
...People who don't mind their own business.
NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
You bitch!
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
I beg your pardon?
Who is this?
I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
COCKSUCKER! 
Are those pussy-willows?
I didn't do it!
No, I don't.
Socially... I'll have a beer.
So you admit you just lied?
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU WHORE!
NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
What do you mean, you're not sure?!
I do, please.
Sorry, Mom. Thanks.  Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
We all have bad nights. 
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
Watch the booth! I'll be back! 
It's the least I could do.  I heard shouting.
Who on earth would want to harass poor Dottie Hinkle?
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
NO! I could never hurt anyone!
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
Right here!
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
There is one big problem though.
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
You forgot something...
Are we leaving?
Yes you are.
From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
Now, here's a babe!
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
How to send a bill!!
Yes, ma'am, it is.
I'll give you fifty cents.
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
Eight dollars?! Franklin Mint or not, it's damaged goods! 
You can't tell.
Can we go there now?
Which room is it?
Yes.
Let's get out of here.
No.
I'd like to get out of here.
You could go and open the door.
No.
Yes.
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
I'll give you a check.
She can only use cash.
How much have you got?
About forty-five dollars.
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
What circumstances?
Hello, Frances.
How's Miss Jacqueline?
You mean Miss Jacqueline's gone, and you don't know where she is?
Redi's all right.
She's a pretty good sort.
What does she do with herself after business hours?
I ought to know.
I did her hair.
What were you talking about?
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
No. She asked about the trademark.
What did she want to know?
She showed me a drawing.
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
But I'd give a great deal to know.
Goodnight, Mary.
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
But you have treated me that way.
Yes.
Well, I'm glad you came to see me.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
Good night.
No, I'm glad....at least I've heard you say it...
I don't know.
That you love Mary.
Not from me.
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
No!
I don't know.
You will die.
Yes.
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
I have something even better.
But you're always at the library.
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
It's because of Jacqueline  I can't go on looking for her --
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
And you believe that?
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
It's here, too.
What a peculiar question.
My dear fellow, it's neither your business to ask, nor mine to tell.
Uhhuh.
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
I'd forgotten.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
Yes. When I tell you.
Tell me what?
I don't know.
But you would like to know where she is?
Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
You're very flippant and perhaps wise, but not wise enough to see the truth, Louis.
No. She's no longer under my care.
Thank you, my dear.
That's too bad.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
I'll be out in a minute.
That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
But she was here?
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
Have you any other relatives, Mary?
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
I know this is difficult for you. I know that you love her.
Then it is decided. Leo and Durk and I will make our plans.
We haven't even begun tea yet.
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell -
I should have known. She had no sincerity - no real belief.
Yes?
Graham Dalton.
False alarm.
Oh. Well, please sit down.
Yes.
No. Why?
Curious.
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
No, I think you look... fine.
Nine years?
Thank you.
Sister older or younger?
Younger.
Who's Elizabeth?
Lawyers.
No.
Okay, I will!!
Kids? What about them?
Impotent.
You're in therapy?
Aren't you?
You had sex with you therapist?
Of course not.
Well, I wasn't always impotent.
Ann. Hello.
Nothing I can't finish later.
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
Videotapes.
Donna?
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
You went out with her?
Not really.
All of these are interviews?
Can we look at one?
Why not?
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
About sex?
Yes.
What about sex?
Everything about sex.
Like what?
Yes.
And they just answer them?
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
To you?
I don't... why... why do you do this?
I'm sorry this came up.
This is just... so...
Maybe you want to go.
Yes, I do.
I know.
Yes.
How did you know?
She said it on her tape.
Why didn't you tell me?
Don't you want to make one?
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
What difference does it make why I do it?
It won't. Are you ready?
Yes.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
When we're making love?
Yes.
Sometimes. Afterward.
Does he go down on you?
Absolutely not.
Do you want me to stop?
Yes.
About who?
I fantasized about you.
About me?
Yes.
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
On tape?
No.
Why not?
That's correct.
So you have had sex.
Yes.
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
What was the problem?
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
How come?
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?
I'm babbling.
No, you're not.
You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
I'm not in love with you.
But if you were?
I... I can't answer that precisely.
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
Why not?
I've told you.
But I don't understand --
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
Yes.
I don't know. Possibly.
But that was part of it?
Possibly.
Why not?
Because.
No.
Mmmmm...
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
I ate by myself.
Are you having an affair?
I'm not either!!
Why don't I believe you?
I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.
No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
Yes.
He does.
Not very often.
You bitch. I knew it.
Yes.
What do you mean?
Did you masturbate?
God, no.
I take it you've never masturbated?
Well, kind of recently, I guess. But not too recently.
No, he left last week.
Did you find him attractive?
What do you mean, like physically?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
Why?
Why, so you can go after him?
I say it because it's descriptive.
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
Well, I'll call him when he does.
What are you talking about?
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
What's wrong with that?
I just thought it might --
I was thinking maybe I shouldn't be in therapy anymore.
Why not?
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
Well, what, then?
I don't want to talk about it.
Then why'd you call me?
I don't know.
What kinds of questions?
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
Cynthia!
What!?
Why did you do that?
Because I wanted to.
I wanted him to see me.
You don't know that for sure.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
Did he touch you?
No, but I did.
You are in trouble.
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
Then why do you keep asking about it?
What is it?
It's a sun dress.
It looks like a tablecloth.
It does not.
Hold on.
Thirty-two dollars.
Well. I can't stay.
Bye.
There's a phone here.
It was busy.
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
Do I know you?
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
I just want to know why you're here.
How did you find me?
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
What do you get?
Why don't you let me tape you?
Talking.
About what?
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
And that's all?
That's all.
Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
And you ask questions, right?
Yes.
How long will it take?
Do I sit or stand?
Whichever you prefer.
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
Just a moment.
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
He said that my hand felt good.
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Do you like the way I look?
Yes.
Prettier than Ann?
Different.
Is that what he tells you?
He doesn't have to tell me.
Hi.
No? Not even one more?
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
I can't talk you into it?
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
No.
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
I did.
No, I mean doing it at my house.
Afraid of getting caught?
Maybe.
You're intrigued?
In here!!
Cynthia. John.
Not today. I've got other plans.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
How about inviting me over to dinner?
You know what I mean.
I want to see you.
When?
Right now.
Cynthia. John.
I don't think my sister would agree.
That you... you don't even know the guy.
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
Why not?
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
I just... Ann is very...
Hung up.
You trust him.
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
How about straightening up the living room?
Graham.
I know. Will you please leave now?
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
No, John, things are getting real simple.
It'll just be me.
Student?
No.  You said three-fifty?
Plus first and last month deposit.
Will you lease month-to-month?
Not for three-fifty.
How about for five hundred?
You were prying before?
She held up very well.
What do you mean?
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
Or go someplace in a hurry.
What tapes?
My keys?
I'm not going to give you my keys.
Brian Kirkland, please.
John Millaney.
One moment.
Yes?
Yeah.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
All right, jesus.
Hi. Want a drink?
You knew these people?
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
Do I get a kiss?
Uh, OK. Sure.
No. I don't think so.
Well? Supper at my place?
OK. But late.
Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
Down to the incinerator.
What do you want to call me at the office for?
Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine...
Oh, but the nurse, she went away. I think she must go to look for you.
Just breathe normally.
Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
That's the one.
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
That you, Rog?
Yes?
Lemme clarify for you.
Huh?
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
NIGHT NIGHT
YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME
GOT MY HEM SO HIGH THEY'LL SAY I'M BEING CHEEKY
WITH LEGS LIKE MINE I'M REALLY MADE FOR DANCING
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
Good!  I'm gonna be there.
A wreck.
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
Time to check with Flavors.
Nothing.  Just...memories!
I got it!  I got it!!!
I got it!  I got it!!!
Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
I've caught it once or twice.
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
Dentonvale has been sold.
SOLD??!!
Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man.
Are you spoken for this evening?
It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
Indulge?
In a little masquerade?
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
Faith, Betty.  But make sure it's your own.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
Yeah, well.  Here, Betty.  I just came to give you this.
Shove it, Ralph!
You too, Betty!
I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR IMPROVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT
TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
He was adopted you know.
I'd forgotten.
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
Too flashy...they'll clash with the new outfits.
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
And how does *'local girl'* Janet Majors fit into the scheme of things?
Of course.
That doesn't make sense.
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
I know.
Why?
Your father doesn't like Mexicans.
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
Vance!  Vance Parker.
YOUNG BLOOD
I NEED SOME
YOUNG BLOOD
I NEED SOME
YOUNG BLOOD
Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
I never signed the contract.  He's not going anywhere.
F for...
Flavors!
F for...
Fabulous!
F for...
Fast!
F for...
Foods!
I don't think he intends to go that far.
What does he know about it?
Yes how are you, Janet?  Are you happy?
Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
WHAT A JOKE...
YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
YOU KEEP GOING BACK IT'S DRIVING YOU INSANE
CRIMINAL
SIN-I-FUL
In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
No.
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
She walks in beauty...
We all love Janet...Who do we love?
Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
You guys having fun?
Well, then put him at the singles table.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
I love you.
Bye.
How's the trip?
Yeah, I'm here.
You're a wonderful writer, Miles. Don't be discouraged.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
What are you pouring tonight?
Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
Glass or bottle?
Bottle.
You got it.
Say, is Maya working?
I'm good.
Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.  You boys hungry?
Is it chicken?
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?
Nice.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
I know. I might need to be spanked.
Good. How're you?
Great. You look great.  You both do.
Not so bad yourself.
Me too.
Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
That's on us.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
Maybe. Recognize this?
I am one of those guys.
You are not.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
You said you had it all lined up.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
And?
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
Um... seventy... something.
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
I told you. Filet and salmon.
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
I owe her a call anyway.
Now we're talking.
I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
When do we get to drink it?
Yeah, that would be a good move.
Just a minute!
We should have driven.
It does. Feels right.
Then it's a good thing.
Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
Pour us a couple.
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
You know her?
Sure I know Maya.
You know that chick?
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
And she likes Pinot.
Perfect.
You're blind, dude. Blind.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Fuck you.
Beautiful.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
I want to go home now.
What do you think?
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
You have the keys.
What?
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
I'm fine!
Bathroom.
Did you drink and dial?
She's been leaving messages here too.
Yeah. Okay.
I will.  See ya!
Right now.
Okay! Jesus!
Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.
What're you drinking?
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
What the fuck are you doing?
With this chick.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
What? Of course I like Christine.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
That was three years ago after that first party!
Oh yeah. Sure.
You're an asshole.
Could be anything.
Been checking your messages?
Huh.
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
Throw me his ball.
Is what the money thing?
With Maya.
What's happening?
I said okay?
I SAID OKAY?
It's private.
Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
Are they too sporty?
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
What's up?
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
Keep it elevated.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
What's that?
What?
What?
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
The plan is... you go.
Me?
Hold on.
Hrnrnrn?
Quite a week.
I'm fine. You rest.
I feel like driving.
Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
I'll pay for it.
You need a new car anyway.
Whatever. Sorry.
No, not whatever. You fucking derelict.
Why don't you come in?
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Back at you.
You were wearing your belt.
Maya, how are you?
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
Sure.
Good for you.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Oh yeah? How is it?
Try it.
Twelve months in oak.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
I know. I love that.
That's what I'm having.
Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.
She got anything good?
How long have you been into wine?
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
Is she sleeping or...?
Yeah. Definitely.
"The Day After Yesterday."
Oh. You mean... today?
Um... yeah but it's more...
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Like what a fraud he was.
Yeah.
Okay. See you around.
Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
Well, nice to see you now.
You too.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
Okay.
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Oh, Maya. No.
Yeah.
Victoria.
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Ken.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
So how're you doing?
Universally rejected. Strike three.
You quit drinking?
I'm pregnant.
See you over there, Miles.
About four weeks.
French or American?
Both.
Good stuff.
This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
I told you I need a drink.
Then buy a bottle and go outside.
Quaffable but far from transcendent.
You golf?
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
I just got divorced. Phyllis.
Right.
Does she ever answer back?
No.
She doesn't answer me either.
This one?
This one?
Don't touch him.
You don't even know what that word means.
Dad!
That's weird.
Who said I was going to die?
Me too.
I don't feel much.
Good.
...Tell Graham --
I'm here.
What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
You got two minor league home run records don't you?
Curse and stuff.
I'm not going to curse.
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Just make noises then.
Explain noises.
I heard.
Yes it was.
Yes, it was.
Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
I got him.
How can you say that?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
What does it matter then?
Eleven a.m. They're gone.
Ray Reddy's house.
They already know we're here.
We have to go in the basement.
Should we make a run for it out the back?
What are you doing?
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
I'm looking!
Got it!
From what?
Me too.
It's getting stronger.
I'm close.
Me too.
Graham.
Don't.
It needs batteries.
Edgar, come inside.
I have some upstairs.
It's old Morgan.
Don't do it.
That means they're unemployed.
Dad.
I just asked his name.
Where are we going to sleep?
The family room.
Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
Don't yell at her!
You're scaring your sister.
Yeah baby. I think someone did.
Don't call me Father.
What's that?
What about them?
There are none.
What was the first thing?
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
Okay.  So he was tall?
I would say so.
You take care of yourself...  Graham.
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
Why not?
Yeah.
You'll lose the signal!
They'll find a way in.
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
That's why they got you in jail?
You're in here for winging a guy?
The one with the shotgun.
There's nobody coming?
McKendrick.
Did it seem short to you?
All right then.  Let's go.
Yeah... maybe. So long.
Sure.
Someplace safe. How you feeling?
Have to.
So far that's all I seen in this life.
Where's Jake?
Is he alive?
Right.
They've been kind to me.
Paden sends his best.
I just came out to say goodbye.
Didn't Paden tell you that?
Yeah... that must have been it.
This is a brutal land.
You must have known that before you came.
It's one thing to know it...
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
My name is Emmett.
And you're not Baxter, either?
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
And they were two of them. Look --
No, Leavenworth.
South of here, past Chimayo.
Gotta meet a guy and head out for Silverado.
It's a town...
They got a saloon there?
I expect.
Women?
I expect.
Which way do you mean?
Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there.
It's not going to be easy.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
You haven't got any money.
All right, you buy me a drink.
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
I've got a job.
Why, J.T., watch what you're saying around Augie. Emmett didn't kill anybody.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
The other guy drew first.
Right!
We didn't get that far.
Blind Pete taught me a great trick.
We wait.
He'll be here.
He is now.
Who is he?
All I did was kiss the girl.
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
I don't want you getting anyone in my place.
Let's get out of here.
I'm done talking. Get out.
You can't do this.
Really?
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
Don't press your luck, Carter.
We'd rather stay.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
I was afraid of that.
Rae, all we got is each other.
I don't have any family any more.
Rae, I need help.
Why come to me?
What makes you think I could?
Why would they stop you?
Because I'm your sister.
Because they enjoy it.
Where's Emmett now?
We'll handle that. He's careless.
Did you hear his son is still around?
Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
Where's the dog?
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
You're right.
Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
I just got to town.
Luck, I guess.
Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
This is a lot of money.
Maybe you could run it without Stella.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
So we understand each other?
Yeah, maybe I will too.
What's she got to do with it?
Good-bye, Paden.
Paden.
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
And I know what I'm talking about.
You like a good saloon?
It's the only place I'm happy.
You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
Here he comes right now.
That's the good stuff.
Oh, yeah? How good?
Give me some of the good stuff.
He left me.
What do you mean?
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I thought you two would get along.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
I'm glad we talked.
Good-bye.
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
Good to see you too, Elaine.
Why isn't she with you?
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
I can't wait to meet her.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
Viktor, it's my studio.
No problem.  Do you want to come in?
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
Hair and make-up?
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
There isn't one.
Even the fall from the plane?
Even the fall from the plane.
Well, shoot it on the last day.
Who else?  It's always Simone's idea.
Everyone you know is lying.
That's true.
-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
-- I can explain.
She doesn't want pity.
You're so good to protect her like this.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
I can imagine.
When is she coming over?
About now.  Would you like a drink?
I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
Not quite.
I just read somewhere --
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
Not if I don't let her.
How can you bring that up at a time like this?
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
Hello, is this Elaine?
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
It was a great show, Dad...
Just a minute.
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
Listen to what you're saying, mom. Is there any evidence she is?
He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
I have to talk to her.
You look so, so...
... so much like her?
I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Do what you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Yes, call me Simone.
Simone?
Is that a problem?
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
How about the nudity?
It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Hello, Hal.
Why not?
There's... a wall between you --
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
How did the wall get there?
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
Somebody said she was here.
I know what you mean.
-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer.
Don't be.  It was worth it.
I've seen them all before.
Not like this --
Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
-- We call them "vactors".
I need flesh and --
-- Flesh is weak.
"Straw God" changed my life.
You saw that?
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
Hello, sweetheart.
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
Hello, Lainey.
This week anyhow.
Is she here tonight?
She can't watch herself.
Why?
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
How?
I read.
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
If anyone asks about Simone --
-- I know, I don't know anything.
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
Night, Lainey.
I do okay.  How about you?
You know me -- married to my work.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
I love you too, daddy.
She did... didn't she?
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
Me and Simone.  What I did.
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
It's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
I think you do.  I know it's a fake.
Er,... good.
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
Don't you?
This should take care of Mother.
Maybe he's talking to himself.
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Dark?
Yes, very.
Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
I will when you're finished writing it.
What do you want -- ?
I don't understand.
You're in breach.
Taller?  What?
Yes, I'd like that.
You could play the lead.
But that's Simone's part.
No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
Is Miss Simone coming today?
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
A star is...
... digitized.
Yes.  Yes, it is.
You know what I'm talking about.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
We can keep it in the bathroom.
--Do I know you?
I didn't leave you.
Goodnight, sweetheart.
Don't step in the horse manure.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
No, just one.
Dr. Crowe.
You're a doctor. What kind?
No.
That's good.
If it's okay with you?
Look over there.
I don't tell her a thing.
That I'm a freak.
Yeah. Sorry.
She died a long time ago.
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
Words.
What kind of words?
Upset words.
What?
I forgot myself.
Yes.
Your eyes told me.
Never mind.
Yes.
I don't know.
I told you what I want.
I don't know, Cole.
When?
Soon. One week.
Yes.
You believe me, right?
Yes, it did.
Are you wigging out?
What happened?
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
Where will you go, where no one has died?
I definitely won't.
And you know what else?
What?
Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.
Oh.
Lots of things.
Anything bad about me?
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
I'm ready to communicate with you now.
Someone got hurt.
They did?
A lady. She died.
Oh my God.
Yes.
Standing next to my window.
They?
Dead people.
They want me to do things for them.
They talk to you?
...I don't know.
You think I'm a freak?
Cole, please stop.
They used to hang people here.
You're a stuttering Stanley!
Stop looking at me.
Who!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering--
--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!
It's our pleasure.
Cheese. It's a kid's place.
How'd he know I'd come?
What are you talking about?
'Course, it's none of my business.
...Chicken blood? Who said it was... "chicken blood"?
You're standing in horseshit.
What's a "little while?"
Two.. maybe three days.
See?
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Slut.
Witch.
Tramp.
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
Bitch.
Which street corner?
...Hi.
...You any good with those?
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
Not lately.
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
Sorry.
You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.
Book of Jeremiah.
Hey. Fuck you.
Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?
Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
Two hundred bucks?? Are you crazy?
-- "Billy-Jean" --
I thought you said two hundred.
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
Nah. We still got Billy Bob.
Let me get this straight... we're talking about manure?
Manure... is life.
It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
Metaphysical question, man.
"-- an AXE!"
"And a slash-slash there --"
Harvest moonshining!
Pardon?
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
People say he was a murderer.
Who then, Jeremiah?? -- Who?!
Amends...?
Not while you're driving.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
-- By way of my breasts?
Who you callin' "boy?"
You got something against farm people, Keith?
What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
Amen.
He's right. You were behind.
Chicken sandwich?
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
Name something.
Then why go back now?
Still trying to figure it out myself.
Nah. Just you.
I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
You never had trouble communicating before.
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
-- You're not making sense!! What "Scarecrow"?
It's you. You and your father.
Don't look.
Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
No. Not without you --
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
Spider.
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
Like your guitar break.
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
Us? We been... moonlighting.
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Why bother?
Bill, we need to talk!
'Mornin', Jack.
Sorry.
Whatcha' doin'?
Just checking out the lights.
Hey, Grant.
That wasn't a good night, no.
I'm sorry.
It's my nature.
And this is mine.
Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
Just block the doors, any way you can.
Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
Yeah.
Do it.
Hell, I was game!
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
What can I do you for?
That's disrespectful.
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
You're my princess, aren't you?
Okay.
You're pretty.
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
Grant, no!
I loved you. I loved --
Grant, you're sick!
Through a wound on his stomach?
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
Your what?
I can make it to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours... that's no sweat.
But it wasn't a Kenworth.
You paying for the gas?
What do you think?
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Why? You have a bowling date?
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
A what?
Eyes on the road.
Okay.
Is this fun?
Driving?
Driving, talking to me...
They're both a challenge.
You have a great profile.
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
Would I lie to you?
I give up.
You just passed your nemesis.
Shoot.
You know, you're not a bad passenger.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
We lost him.
Enjoy your Kenworth.
Ciao.
He's after us again!
I would've come back for you.
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
How do you know?
You take the front, I'll take the back.
Yeah?
Ummm?
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
What kind of a guy is he?
The minute you see him, you'll know.
Weight Station.
Well, thanks for the lift.
Hey...
That man is your father?!?
You gotta admire the man's determination.
See ya, Kate.
I'm begging.
I'll do it.
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
No what?
That's me.
No.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
See.
And if we don't, they're gonna be riding high in a brand new Kenworth.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
But I still don't think...
Running blocker.
Yeah?
Why are we doing this?
Because they said it couldn't be done.
Redneck heaven.
They're jammed!
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 'em to bill Kyle.
Forty-two minutes ahead.
Save it. We got a long haul.
Clear and rolling.
This is Bandit I, come back.
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
What's your twenty?
Not for long, you ain't.
If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
Yeah, guy?
Do I have a choice?
What's your twenty?
'Bout fourteen miles this side of Mississippi.
I'm at marker eight-five.
Son-of-a-gun. Me too.
I hate to say it...
Then don't.
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
Bandit?
Anything else you don't want me to know?
Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.
We're outta motion lotion.
I'll believe it when I see it.
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
Roger. Keep the shiny side up and the greasy side down.  Right, Fred?
I'm here.
I'm cucumber cool.
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
Go breaker.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
My handle's Smokey Bear and I got you by the tail.
Pick it up, Breaker.
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
About one to five years worth.
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
Believe me, that won't be a problem.
Where the hell are you?
Who's Fred?
Yes, ma'am.
How's your twenty?
You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
Then it must be a helluva idea.
Yes, sir.
Chickenshit money.
Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
-- Okey, doke. Last one to the Roadeo is a homo.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
Of course. Yes.
And who has access to that floor?
No.  I'm going over there. You take the car from there, get out to the lake.
Mortal.
Yeah.
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
You're sure?
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
You shot me and murdered my friends.
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
And threw us into the lake.
But there were more of you?
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
Two of 'em?
You were here huntin' a man named Israel, weren't you? Your name is Tremor.
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
Yeah, why.
...About what?
I'm not doing cocaine.
I sent Hugo, he should be there!
I got his machine.
I said I got his machine.
No, what did you say on the machine?
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
Only if you really, truly mean it.
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
I am. Yeah.
Without peer?
I -- uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.
We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
They what? What? No. No. Why?
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
What are you doing here?
My debrief --
-- will be handled back in --
-- no, we need to handle it now.
-- You can and you will.
You're finished.
...He does now...
I wouldn't go that far.
No... We're trying to save Heller.
...So you knew all this and yet y--
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
Yeah... Sid?
You got clicks, anything?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
Shoot.
A million flat.
No shit.
None whatsoever.
Yeah... Sid?
Right, you got clicks, anything?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
How are we on time...?
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
Like a mafucka.
That takes some of the sting out.
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
Damn, this kevlar ridin' up on me, I wish they made this more sheer.
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
-- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
Security's locking down the elevators.
Leave the light off.
No?  Who am I, then?
A puppet.
Didn't you talk to Snow?
I want to hear your version.
In the lab.  With her, probably.
Her?  Who are you talking about?
She reappeared exactly as she had before?
That's fantastic.
Not her.  It.
No, she won't.
Whose side are you on?
He's dead.
How?
He'll let me in.
Kelvin, if you see anything unusual...
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
Dead?
I wish you'd told me.
Told you what?
What is it?
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
When you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt?
Human beings can die.
That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.
She drank liquid oxygen.
Just get him to stop.
Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should we check?
Yes.
I'll go with you.
I'll just be a minute.
Why?
I'll be right back.
To calm your anxiety.
To calm my anxiety.
Yes.
You didn't look very happy.
I wasn't.
And tonight?
Better.
Stop it.
You go home.
All right.  How about I feel better when you take them?
What do you mean?
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
It's something.
You still don't believe in God?
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
As I said, then it's God, right?
When I saw you were gone I got scared.
You don't know?
I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
I'm glad.
You don't love me.
When?  When I'm asleep?
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
Why did she do it?
Was she right?
No.  I love you.
I love you, too.
Rheya.
Not this time.
If you're here.
Gibarian.  He was here.
You said he was dead.
He is.  But he was here...
It's all right.
I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
Don't call me that.
No.
You're lying.  I'm not human.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
Thank you.
You never said you wanted one.
I never said I didn't.
I can't stay here.
Then you won't make it.
You're lying.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
Who are you, then?
But then I would be dead now.
I want to stop taking those pills.
I wish you wouldn't.
A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?
I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
When?
Why do you say that?
He won't.
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
I'm not Snow.
Hello, Win.
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
You didn't like him?
Looks a little constipated to me.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
Can we go then?
I'm supposed to call in.
There's a phone in the car.
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
Queens... You know Queens?
Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
No, Ma'am.
I got money.
Not too sure about that.
Let's get a drink.
Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
I came on at 8:00.
Listen, that was my fault.
He said he'd kill me.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
Hmm...
Yeah, what a woman.
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
You were reading my Renoir.
Could be, I guess.
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger gets me.
Yeah.  It was.
But "nice".
Very nice.
You don't like him, do you?
Tell it like it is.
You asked.
I'll miss you, Mike...
Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
Sleep good.
What do you want?
Open the door, will you?
I can't open it.
Let go!
Stop being nuts!
I do care about you!
She's okay.  Everything's okay...
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
What do you want to do?
I don't know.
Are you okay?
I'm going away after that, the next morning.
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
Do you dance?
I know.
... Don't explain.
Long enough.
"To"... Forget about you.
Mike...?
Yeah.  It's all over.
So.
I don't know...
You don't have to, now.
I think it's probably still a good idea.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
You take care.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Not if you don't want me to.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Just putting in an appearance then.
... I don't want to talk about it...
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
And I'm making mine.
Nothing.
Sure we are, let's go!
I'm all right.
Take my advice, don't buy any...
What?
My ass if falling.
Your what...?
My ass is falling.  It is.
What are you talking about?
Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.
Just keep it someplace safe, but handy.
It's twenty bucks in the bank.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
What shit, honey?
You don't want to hear about it.
Why?
I'd identify him.
Where'd you get the tie?
It's not your taste.
What did she say the down payment was?
I had to follow her to a store.
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
Ellie, it was a formal party...
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear what I said?!!
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
You heard me.
I'm not saying it's your fault.
I watched TV.
What did you watch?
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
I'm all right.
When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment.
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
Be happy.  He's good at this.
It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
Ever shot anyone?
Yes.
Does it make you... hard?
No, sir...
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
I brought the girl.  She's outside.
I'll prove it!
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
What the fuck you doin'?!
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
Scrambled eggs surprise?
I know where everything is.
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...
Yeah, I think so.
Okay, I guess.
How about dinner tonight?
Mom and I got plans.
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
She's taking singing lessons.
She's what?
Shooting?
I don't think she can sing, either.
Take care, pal.
At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
Be nice.
Let me see.
No. No, that's okay.
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
Nonot really.
Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn't.
I'm always here, Pete.
See?
Hm.  What a lump.
Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
They'll never take me alive.
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
I know.  I've got one too.
Mm-hmm.
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Oh. Well, hang in there, amigo.
Lemme down, bugface!
That's not even close.
Get away from me, freak!
I think you're trying to tell me something.
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
Can we make it a hundred?
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
Fine.
A spider.  Eight legs.
How about tomorrow?
You're making my life difficult.
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
An even five I throw in the jacket.
Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
Some things you should say anyway.
What if the world ends tomorrow?
How very dull, Peter Parker.
It's too early to be clever.
Uh is a good start.
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
Oh.  Well, I hate you and everyone who looks like you.
I hate people with alliterative names.
I hate--
Back to the lab.  Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
But you like that in a man?
You should write that one down.
I've gotta study.
Oh. Maybe I should, too--
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
That wasn't clever.  That was just nasty.
That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
I think I'd like that.
Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
Oh, God, I forgot to--
I'm here...
I know him.
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Peter-- my condolences.
Any sign of our friend?
Precise equipment such as waldos
That's the understatement of the year.
I'm a photographer, remember?
Yes.  Do you have a date?
It'll shut itself off.
Tofu.  Ben, I wish you wouldn't.
You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
See?  You big dullard.
It's fine.  Tell me what--
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Aunt May, what happened?
Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.  You did.
I left a paper in my desk.
You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
You have no right!  This is cosmic suicide!
Hi, Professor.  What's up?
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
Your dog ate it.
Actually, I got this spider bite
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Really, Professor, I--
How much do you know about it?
Luck.  The right place at the right time.
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
I'll try. Thanks.
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
Like it?
Nah.  The big mask was better.
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Just drop me off here.
Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
No, no!  Not there!
They never caught on.
Plenty.
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Is you all good Nazis?
Is you all little Adolfs?
Jawohl!
Any news on Dunbar?
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
Static!
Okay. Move on.
Get going on the trap door.
We'll get some more.
Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
A little something what?
Thanks.
I'll call the whole pot.
Okay, Security -- what happened?
There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Don't wear it out!
Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
Yeah.
What are the chances busting out of here?
Let's!
What is your number?
105-353.
Abfuehren!
You will remember the name? Von Scherbach? VON SCHER-BACH!
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
What exactly is he charged with?
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
I am not. According to the Geneva Convention --
Isn't it?
Jawohl?
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
It's a mouse trap.
And this?
Why do you do this to me every morning?
Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!
You can say that again!
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
I said say it again. I didn't say repeat it.
They'll shoot you, Animal!
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
You want Betty Grable!
Let me go!
Betty Grable!
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Me? What if she don't want me?
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
Let go, Animal! It's chow! We'll miss chow!
No?
Where'd that come from?
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
He's the grrrrreatest!
Come on, baby! Daddy's going to buy you a hunk of cheese!
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
You clocked him! Why don't I clock you?
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
She'll never forgive me!
Bombs away!
What do they always say?
That's what I wanna hear.
It's not good for you, Animal.
You hold him. I'll slug him.
Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
Do Jimmy Durante!
Hey, here's Esther Williams.
Animal! Got a little something for you!
I'll open mine, too.
You're crying, Animal.
It's that song, Harry!
You want to go?
No. I want to draw.
Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
You have a Lieutenant here...
Yes, sir.
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.
The guy I want to talk to is Sefton. Where's Sefton?  You haven't seen Sefton, have you?
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
Says me.
Every time the men get Red Cross packages you have to think up an angle to rob them.
Lay off, I said -- if you don't want your head handed to you.
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
We did it.
Anybody cover?
You told them, Hoffy.
Who did?
You off your rocker?
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Nothing for Kuzawa?
Shapiro. Shapiro.
Just what makes you so popular?
They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
What did you say?
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
Give me the radio.
We have no radio.
Ich weiss alles.
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
What guy?
Yes, you do!
No! No!
How many do you want? A thousand?
Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
Always joking. Always making wisecrackers!
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
Give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
A chicken?
Just don't drool on it.
What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
Oh! Somebody was peeking!
Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
HoS qorDu. 
We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
Where is he?
Full disruptors.
Can you project its course?
Approximately two hundred thirty million.
Really? What do you feel?
You get what?
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
We better get you back to the ship  La Forge to Enterprise.
One minute to warp core breach.
The station complement was nineteen.
Beam them directly to Sickbay.
I'll go. You have the Bridge.
You're in the Nexus.
All of us.
Where is he now?
Wherever he wanted to be.
Why would you want to leave?
Yes, where would you go?
I don't understand.
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
Please, I insist.
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
Yes, yes, it is.
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
Temporal nexus, yeah, I heard you.  Something's missing.
That's right.
Close to retirement?
I hadn't planned on it.
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
And what would that be, sir?
It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
Aye.
I always do.
Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
Is there a problem?
No, sir.
Thank you, Number One.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
No. Thank you.
Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
Well, I appreciate your concern, but I'd rather not discuss it right now, thank you.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
There's nothing selfish about pursuing your own life, your own career.
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
The thought had crossed my mind.
What if I told you I found a new truth?
Lock phasers and return fire!
And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
Execute!
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
Sure - whatever games you wanna play.
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Nothing. As before.
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
Scotty...?
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
On screen.
What is it?
David... Sorry I'm late.
I went wrong.
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.
A photon tube...!
... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
My readings indicate great instability.
David --
Spock's burial robe.
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
I have already made one transmission too many...
Why?
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
And Spock with it. They are joined together.
I'll go...
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
Gentlemen... may the wind be at our backs. Stations please!
The <u>doors</u>, Mr. Scott!
Scan for vessels in pursuit!
Just him, sir!
Saavik... Is... David with you?
Goodbye, David.
What? What are you saying?
. He will remain always as he is.
Much is at stake...
Yes. And I know you.
Why would you do this...?
The ship... Out of danger...?
Very well.  Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
She's to be decommissioned.
I'll need it, Sulu.
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
I think it's an energy form, sir...
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
Red alert, Mr. Scott.
With some on the planet...
Close... There --
Come on!
Best speed to Vulcan. Mr. Chekov, take the prisoners below.
Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.
It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
Hmm.. Very odd.  Scotty. Progress report?
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor.
Welcome home, Jim.
Indisposed, sir.
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
Any time.
Torpedoes coming in -- !
All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
No tricks. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Kirk out.
You should take the Vulcan, too.
But, why?
Because you wish it.  
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... <U>Give me Genesis</U>!
Yes...
... The needs of the few...
... Or the one.
... Spock...
What must I do?
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul.
Understood, my lord.
Station!
But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
They know we would die first.
Steady. Continue on impulse power.

Wait!... Wait...

Put him on screen!  Study him well.
How is that...?
This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
That's all you have to say?
I'm not a drama critic.
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
Exactly. Happy birthday.
Say thank you.
Thank you.
And who am I hiding from?
From yourself, Admiral.
Ah.
The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
I got beat. We're only alive because I knew something about these ships that he didn't.
Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Our first order of business is survival.
It's like the Garden of Eden...
Young. I feel young, Doctor.
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
... Can't read you... repeat...
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
... taking Genesis away from us...
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
Mother, go back!
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
I saw it -- !
There's an air-lock.
What's the matter -- ?
Never mind! Hurry!
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
I'm Doctor Marcus!
She's making it up! My father was Professor --
We appear to have plenty of time.
What?
We encoded four minutes --
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
You can't!
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
Are you running away from me?
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
I am truly sorry.
Is that what you came here to say?
Only half of you would get there.
The Admiral's son.
Don't you believe it.
I don't know.
Let them eat static.
They're still running with shields down.
Raise them --
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
Visual --
I shall avenge you --
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
We'll be going to warp speed --
Aye, sir --
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
I'm going down to the station.
Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.
I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
Try the emergency channels...
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
Scotty, let's have it.
Admiral --
Sensors, Captain?
I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott?
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
Aye, sir.
Admiral, this is Spock.
Not at present.
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
Yes, SIR.
The word is given: warp speed.
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this.
None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times.
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
To be sure, Captain.
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
Yes.
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
It would explain a great many things --
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
It's all we've got.
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
A distinct possibility.
Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
Uhura, patch me in --
The ship -- out of danger?
Yes --
Or the one.
Yes, sir.
Very well.
Because... there was no way to win.
Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.
It is still regulation, Admiral.
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
I did not think so.
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
I failed to resolve the situation.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
Take the test again.
Energize defense fields.
Who?
HURRY.
Phasers on stun. Move out.
The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
At what.
All stop, sir.
Power levels quite low, sir.
Aye, sir.
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Engine room! What's happening?!
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
Distance from Reliant...
Dismiss the company.
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Stop engines.
Engage warp engines --
Trying, sir!
Scotty!
Battle stations.
Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
... Now entering the Neutral Zone...
Aft thrusters, sir.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
He's very human.
Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
Aye, sir.
By the book...
I exaggerated.
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
The question is irrelevant.
To Earth. To offer testimony.
You do this -- for friendship?
... They do, indeed.
Just a couple of kooks...
Fine. Just fine.
Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
A moment alone, please.
What do you mean?
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
That's crazy!
Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
Come on, Pavel...
Not me, Bones... They did it.
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
Then how.?
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
Well nobody's perfect...
It is.
I was not informed about observers.
Reading the patient's vital signs.
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
Name?
My name?
I do not know your name.
You play games with me and you're through
I am? May I go now?
I'm wery sorry, but --
I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
Shields, aye.
Sir, heat shields at maximum!
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Understood. What is your plan?
Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!
We are launching everything we have.
The hell they did.
I was not.
Is there something wrong with the one I have?
The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
I buy that. What about him?
You've already been that. C'mon.
Go ahead.
What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
Implicitly.
You're upset about losing the whales.
... You're very perceptive.
How will that be done, exactly?
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
Hm?
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
What do you mean now?
What's what?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
Who do you think I am?
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
I'm all ears.
So. There we are.
Right.
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
... Gone?!
Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
Thank you. For everything.  Beam me up, Scotty.
Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
Permission granted.
Thank you, Admiral.
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
Uhura... Can you modify the Probe's signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors?
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
In progress, Admiral.
Uhura. Get me through to Starfleet Command.
What is our target in time?
The late 20th Century.
I have.
... Simple logic.
Yes?
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
The hell I can't
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
Thank you, Spock.
Right.  Will you help us?
Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
They did, Admiral.
Then... Where the hell are we?
No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
Steady as she goes...
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
... Aye sir...?
What is our condition?
Go, Mr. Sulu.
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Three-one-zero, aye!
Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Picture, Uhura!
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
On speakers.
Everyone remember where we parked.
Mercy Hospital.
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
Put them on screen!
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
Out of control, and blind as a bat!
About 60 feet, Admiral.
I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
Oh I see --  Tell Them phasers on stun. Good luck. Kirk out.
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium.
No power to the bay doors.
The explosive override -- ?
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
Admiral, you'll be trapped!
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
You will be in good hands here.
Do you have the right to murder?
I demand to see the owners! I demand --
If you'll follow me, Professor --
Sill? What else would I be working with?
Just use the keyboard...
The keyboard... How quaint.
Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
Then you must spend your life answering questions.
There are days.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
For someone so young.
By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do.
I thought it might begin the healing process.
The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...
I don't.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
Really.
For what purpose?
Androids... don't have...fun.
Why not...?
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
Data doesn't breathe.
Won't he rust?
No.
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
Yes. But look at this medscan...
Is it safe to move her?
Safer than leaving her here.
Captain, Geordi...?
You're aboard the Enterprise.
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
'Just a few loose ends to tie up.'
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
Will the structure hold if we blast through?
I believe it is safe, sir.
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
Planet's population. Six hundred people. You want to avoid unnecessary risks? Next time leave your android home.
He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
It is over.
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
Good luck. Dougherty out.
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
There's nothing further to be gained from this...
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
Deploy the collector.
Are they...?
Do you have everything you need from command?
When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment...
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
You got me, Commander.
That's your expert opinion?
Why not?
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
It's our only way out of here, Mister Nara.
How long 'til they reach us?
Remind me to lodge a protest...
We're through running from these bastards.
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
Deck ten.
Commander Riker...
So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
Would you like something to eat?
No, we're here to... rescue them.
Slow to impulse. We're on our way.
We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out.
We're trying to get to you, sir...
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
Beam him out!
Transferring controls to manual.
No, sir. It is a gorch.
No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.
Can you beam him off?
Say the greeting again...
Wine, women and song.
You should feel right at home with them.
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
Was I doing something to your neck?
Why don't you try sitting up?
Or you could try lying down.
You're in quite a mood today.
... I'm not sleeping well...
Augh?
Activating injector assembly.
All ship functions are off-line.
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
Isolate one and re-route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor...
Good hunting. Hayes out.
I look forward to reading your report.
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
You think they're still up there?
That might not be so bad... at least for you.
At least four hours.
We have two... but we don't have the juice to run them.
Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
I do not know what you are referring to.
That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again...
And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
I believe so.
Do it.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
Where's the Sphere?
According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
I am the Borg.
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
I told you, there's no --
Where?
Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
How serious is the damage?
Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
There should be an access hatch nearby...
I have the password right here.
It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
Entering the upper ionospere...
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
Active.
Main bus...
Ready.
Initiate pre-ignition sequence.
Great name. French?
Yes.
You don't sound French.
California. San Francisco.
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
Something wrong with that?
Not yet.
The invasion plans.
Invasion.
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
I'm afraid you've caught me. I am a space-man.
I can try.
You're lying.
What makes you say that?
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
How did you know about that?
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
Some.
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
I have to...
No. It's a lot further than that.
Why?
On screen.
Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
Fire.
Data, set a course for that vortex.
Steady as she goes.
Fire!
We're still in Earth orbit.
On screen.
Life signs?
Yes, sir.
Unless you'd like to stay.
No, sir.
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
Computer -- thermal enhancement.
Destroy the deflector dish.
The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation.
Just a little queasy...
We've lost Bridge control!
Emergency override!
Nothing.
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
Where the hell are they going?
Riker here.
Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?
Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
Commander... we have a problem.
Admiral Donald...Bill...
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
I'll bear it in mind, Admiral. I think that's all.
The charge is murder.
Fascinating...
Vulcans sleep lying down...
We DO sleep lying down.
We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...
That's the question -
I wish I knew. Uhura?
What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
Speak for yourself. One day... one night...
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
I didn't mean this future.
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time to -
Still think we're finished?
No way.  You see this?
Spock's looking for us...
Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
Come on...
And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
Then let me help!
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
Retire.
You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
That's a comfort...
I'm not sure how to take that.
Very much.
You feign ignorance?
WHAT HAPPENED?
How can I trust --
Take them away.
And what did they tell you?
That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
Yes.
Spoken by you?
Yes...
Those words WERE spoken by me.
For insubordination.
I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
I know what you mean...
Uhura, monitor!
Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
Who else?
But if she's cloaked...
Shields up. Battle stations.
Shields up, Captain --?
You tell them, Lieutenant.
Now we go to Starfleet?
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
Mr. Valtane, any more data?
Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding?  Send to Starfleet Command...
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
I shall look forward to it.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
They'll be here...
I like it here...
Kill him! He's the one!!
Not me, idiot - HIM!
And your coat.
There's a reward for your death.
We didn't kill Gorkon.
Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
It IS possible.
Where do we come in?
Captain, if --
WHO ELSE...?
Kronos, sir?
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
I always wanted to try that.
Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
Captain.
Mr. Chekov, anything unusual?
You hear that?
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
According to my information, today.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
I was asked by my father to open neg-
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
They're dying.
LET THEM DIE.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
I am uncertain.
Spock, I'm really tired...
We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
What peace conference?
I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
Spock, you want to know something?
Not yet... Section 4236...
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
WE SURRENDER.
Who else?
Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.
Faith...?
Such things have happened before, sir.
Not as yet, sir.
An error.
I don't want to.
Confirmed, Captain!
We've been ordered to -
You having hearing problems, mister?
No, sir.
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
What is it?
... I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.
What's left of it.
I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
I think  not.
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
Nevertheless.
Not from us!
How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
He's placing himself in a most awkward position...
Maybe we should write them a letter?
Yes, please continue.
You are me.
No.
Is that your final answer?
Because you are dangerous.
Why?
I know.
Indefinitely.
How long is that?
I think a skin cells the more likely of the two.
You're working late.
Soon then.  Ill save the last dance for you.
To happy endings.
To new worlds...
New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...
I can see that.
Sorry, sir.
Aye, sir... This way.
It would appear so.
There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
Fire!
Yes.
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers!
Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.
Sir.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
I thought only me, myself and Lore.
Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.
Why is it moving?
The resemblance is... striking.
With pleasure, Captain.
Of course, sit down.
And I you.
I don't know.
I know how he thinks.
No!
Understood.
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties.
Weve got him!
Ready, sir!
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
Number One.  You have the bridge.
There's more... as always. He's Reman.

Not with the Romulans.

Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
Wont do what, Mister Worf?
Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
If you don't mind.
Not yet, Mister Worf.
Captain!
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
On screen.
On screen.
On my way. Please notify Commander Riker.
Your new chair, sir.
Counselor?
She's a predator.
Away team. Transporter room four.
Can anything be done for him?
We can only hope so.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
I have dissolved the Senate.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
How did you end up on Remus?
I have no reason to.
Yes.
Age before rank, Jean Luc.
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
With a full head of hair.
There is that.
In time.
I was lonely...
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
Not so long.
But you want to.
Please.
Its too late.
I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!
On my way.
Disruptors are off-line, sir.
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...
He's a very unusual android.
Runs in the family.
Should I raise shields?
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
Let's go.
Yes, Praetor.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
Find her again.
No -- this is wasting time.
Do as I tell you!
Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
A matter of hours now.
You heard me.
FULL STOP AND FIRE !
She is here.
And?
They will obey, Praetor.
I came this far alone ...
You don't have to understand.
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
I don't want to scare them away.
No, we can handle this.
Thank you.
Have a nice trip.
How much are your rooms?
I'll take that.
We're only going to be here a few hours...
It's still the full price.
What do you do?
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
Make any money?
No.
It is beautiful.
He's got a gun!!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Where did you stop last?
Stay right there...
What was your last stop?
Elmo's...
Where's that?
They must have picked it up in space.
There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
What do you mean by 'contain?'
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
It's in a green Mustang?
Clarify that.
Oh shit!!!
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
What's all this for?
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
No, we don't.
You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
I just retired.
This is George Fox...
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells?
Don't... don't do this... please...
What.
Ah no.
Steering wheel.
Gear shift.
Dashboard.
Dashboard.
Eh... police.
Police...
Good.
Good.
That way.
Flashlight.
Coupons.
Pancakes.
X...
Money.
We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
Smile... good?
Yes.
Minneapolis.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
You're full of tricks, aren't you?
No gas.
This car runs on gas.
Yes. Very good.
You'll see.
Jennyhaydn.
Closed.
I know.
My... husband.
Shit?
Shit... shit... what shit?
Stop!! Enough!! Jesus! You're worse than a parrot!!
You. Mouth closed.
Okay.
No.
Yes.
A drink.
I...
You want to try it?
I want to try it.
This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
Music.
You didn't even see it.
You better.
My...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home.
How will I do this one?...
Yes.
Yes. Day... night.
Yes.
Eh... yes...
Do you have a baby?
No... The closest...
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
But I speak English.
Yes.
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
No.
Yes?
What?
It's a kiss...  Goodbye...
I was afraid.
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
Yes.
It's bad.
He will.
Are you my friend?
Yes.
I am your friend.
Why?
I don't know.
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
Not all... but it feels like a kiss.
I do not want to.
Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
That was beautiful.
You liked my singing?
Yes. Sing some more.
No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
I must meet my ship.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
I feel better if I move.
We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
Where did you learn that?
The cook.
I can't stay on this planet.
No one's traveling in this weather.
You promised you would get me to my ship.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
You're damn right I am.
I do not get cold.
Nothing.
Do they talk?!
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
I want to gamble.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
Yes.
I will say that we can be friends.
You want the baby to laugh at me.
Many, many days and nights...
Where?
I must go.
You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
I will.
Goodbye.
You could have killed us both!!
Call the police!!
Hey buddy... let her go...
My grandmother's rich.
Slow down, slow down.
Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
In the cars, too?!
What? No, of course not.
Get Fox.
I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
I did.
Save us all a lot of trouble.
Very beautiful country up here...
It could have been anything.
To the same woman?
Yes.
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
The police think he was high on drugs...
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
Judy, that's stupid.
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
We can't let you do that.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George.
A star is born.
Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
Leave him alone, Tran.
Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale.
You're going down.
Maybe later.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
Forget it's there.
Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
I just got to talk to you for one second.
No, Lenny.
Tonight.
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
No.  Mace is in this.
You think Tran killed her?
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
Step into my office.
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
Let's work it.
And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
Top ten.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
Is he dead?
Thanks, buddy.  See... things weren't bad enough.  They weren't fucking bad enough!
Only way I could stand your ties.
Where's Faith?
Jesus!
You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always bring you choice.
What else you got?
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
Strickland.
Commissioner Strickland.
I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.
Your existence.
Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
Driving Mr. Lenny.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Define illegal.
Define love.
Fumitsu.
Coming with you.
Let's talk in the car.
I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
No, you're just trying to get off.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies?
She still loves me.
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
No idea.
Black.  Jack.
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
Wants to share.
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
No it doesn't.
Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
And what about the guy that was following me?
Jesus, Mace!
No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
Fire's out, isn't it?
You sure?
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
There's a plus side?
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
How long does it last?  Oh.
Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
Uh unh.
And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
Then we'll be right where we are now.
See you downtown.
Yeah.  See you there.
Are you going to make me beg?
Well give me some then... I'm starving.
Take the tape to the cops.
There's more to this whole thing than you think.
You really want that on your head?
Um... he was older.
Besides that.
Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Anybody talk to the press?
The diner?
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
Ten miles back on the Texas side.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
This isn't in our database?
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
You tell me.
What?
She's buried.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Hi. What's in the case?
You must travel a lot, huh?
Whole country or just hereabouts?
I don't mean to be rude, but...
Not bad, huh?
You're a... you're sick.
What's wrong with me?
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
What do you want from me?
Why me? What do you want from me!?
He had an orange hat on.
At the field office.
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
Smarter than us.
We have another one.
Another what?
What are you doing?
Please.
Speck. Harold Speck.
From the grave?
MyDick.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
He got away. I had him. He got away.
If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
What I do requires confidentiality.
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
I don't believe this.
I'm hesitant to...
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
I was visiting an old college friend.
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
I didn't use Low's name.
There was talk of a file photo.
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.
Five months. I love it.
Not especially.
That information's being withheld from the media.
A very sexy case.
Where's my watch? It's gone.
It explains a lot.
The man knew how to dress.
You want to have dinner?
What's that?
Sex.
No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
Oh yeah, I forgot.
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
I know.
I've been thinking about this.
He's called a couple times.
What did you tell him?
Just routine stuff.
Not about coming to see Daitz?
Not yet. Not about this, either.
We did find these, however.
Sue Ann Hanson.
You mean --
Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
Then there's the other issue.
What's that?
Not the way I can.
I just need to go a little slow.
Jaime? Where are you?
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
Suspect Zero.
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
What's going on?
You were right. He found me.
And you're working with him?
Yeah, of course.
What's going on?
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
I'm going to Amarillo.
Kulok.
Sit back.
I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
No weapon.
The little piggie speaks.
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
Yeah, problem was, I had the only copy. See ya.
Yeah.
Whatever happened to MyDick?
Something came up, Murman, my man.
[Follow me.]
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
[Not the heart, the watch.]
I want to go live with you.
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
[I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
So you're the new meat?
Yes, sir.
I believe it's in my file, sir.
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
The same.
I talked to him.
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
Take your shirt off.
I know, I know.
You're right. I know.
Ever since I've known you.
I don't know about that.
Are you calling Her?
No. Stop, come on.
Shuddup.
Shut up.
What do you drive?
I'm sorry?
Oh... a Cavalier.
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
You're a comedian?
Yeah.
What's that like?
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
You better pay the man.
Nikki.
Thank you, Nikki.
Hi.
I'm Mike.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Like the quiche?
Yes. Like the quiche.
I like quiche.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
Why? You're not a real man?
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
How was it hard?
Well, I left someone very special behind.
You too?
Yeah.
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
How?
What what? What advantages?
Anything.
Oh. You know.
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
...and even then...
...you might get cut out.
What else is going on?
My pleasure.
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
No.
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
Well, no harm done. This is Lisa. I'm sorry, I never got your names...
Don't worry. He's in good hands.
I'm a "Dorothy".
Did you get it?
...And she's with someone else.
The poor thing. I'll make some coffee.
Could you believe it?
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
I'm a comedian.
Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
Sure, that'll be fine.
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
What do you do, Trent?
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
It's a rebound.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
I understand.
Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
Listen. I had a great time.
Me too.
Let me get a pen out of my car.  Do you have something to write on?
Yeah. And an actor.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
...It's really getting late.
...home. It's getting late. Yeah.
...Which one...?
...well, it suits you...
Hi, Mike?
Lorraine?
Yeah, hold on.
I can call back...
No, no. Hold on.
How are you doing?
Fine... I guess. You?
Good.  I think about things.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What kind of things?
You know, us.
I thought you met someone else.
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
I miss you, Mike.
Why didn't you call?
So what's the difference?
Well that sucks.
It sucks.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
There's the rub.
It's a gig.
I mean, I need the money.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
It's definitely a step back for me.
I didn't want to say anything.
I didn't mention her once today.
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
I'll give you an eight. 
What'd you get?
An eight.
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
Classy.
Bud.
There's the rub.
...yeah, a month ago.
Well, let's hit that party.
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
Oh, like that song...
You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
No. Just O.J.
What's the point?
Oh boy.
I'm such an asshole.
She wasn't your type anyway.
Well, that's dumb.
What's dumb about it?
Well, you're doing so well...
Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again.
Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup.
Make someone bleed.
No, man, we're in the play-offs.
He's trying to be an actor.
Damned if I know...
Not well.
Rejected?
I can't believe you.
She's really special, guys.
Wow, I guess you were home... 
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
S'up Trent?
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
What are you talking about? Vegas?
What Vegas?
We're going to Vegas.
When?
Tonight, baby.
You're crazy.
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
What?
Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
Vegas!
Vegas.
Whu?
You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
She smiled baby.
That's not cool.
Did she, or did she not smile?
It doesn't matter...
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
We're gonna get laid, baby.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
Oh, they're watching all right. They're watching.
What?!?
You gotta do it.
Always, baby.
Thanks for clarifying that.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Yea, how much?
Let's just leave.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
Who's the big winner?
What an asshole.
That was so demeaning...
She smiled, baby.
Did she, or did she not smile.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
I know she's coming back.
I don't think so.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
Yes!
I'm telling you!
I gotta use the phone.
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
She didn't like me, anyway.
She thought you were money.
I don't think so.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
That was different.
How?
What?!?
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
No. Doesn't that suck?
Yeah.
Aww... He got away?
It starts at eight...
Yeah. You met him once.
Yeah. He's a "rounder".
...through the kitchen...
It's on.
Which one?
Minnie Pearl.
What?
That doesn't matter.
What a surprise.
We're not messing with you...
Tomorrow?
Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
Oh. He's got it under control...
Chelios to Roenick...!
That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
They're a finesse team...
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
...How novel.
Now?
Is she looking now?
Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
What was cold about it?
You think?
You are so money, and you don't even know it...
...you're money...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
Now go over there and get those digits.
...Yeah.
Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
...it's on.
...it is so on.
Be smart about it.
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
You don't have to wait three days...
...just be smart about it.
I'll be back with the coffee.
Good.  He never doubted you.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
The Court gave you justice.
An eye for an eye!
But your daughter is still alive.
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
Shut up.
OK, OK.  You gonna make me something to eat at least?
I'm not hungry yet.
Eat it, it's on the table.
Ba Fa Goulle.
BA FA GOULE YOU!
Yeah.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
OK, but be careful.
No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
Sure.
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
You understand him better than anyone.
And with prison record.
This morning.
It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again.
Now you've had your drink.
Barzini.
Tom said he'd take care of it.
For bravery.
And this?
For killing a man.
What miracles you do for strangers.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
And now, what do you choose to do?
I'm going to finish school.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
You wanted me to be your son.
How did you find out?
I'll need him.
Good.
Godfather, you understand everything.
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
Where are you going?
Corleone.
No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
How do you know I come from America?
Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say?
No, she's going home to her family. She'll join me in a few weeks...
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
Beautiful all over, eh?
He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.
Come here a minute, Fredo.
That's for you to find out.
Get rid of them...
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
Can you do it Mike?
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
Nobody knows where he is.  We know he's all right, but that's all.
An accident.  No one was hurt.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
Mike, why am I out?
I know now.  I'll make them call me Don.
I told you I had a lot of relatives.
They're waiting to see my father.
They're talking to themselves.
You really want to know?
Yes.  Tell me.
You like spaghetti?
You know I love spaghetti.
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
Michael, I love you.
I told you you wouldn't like him.
He's coming over here!
My brother, Tom Hagen.
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
I'm thinking about it.
Michael...
How is your father?
He'll be OK.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Can you say it?
Huh?
Tell me you love me.
Please say it.
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
When will I see you again?
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
Wake me up when you come to bed?
Don't ask me.
Tell me!
How can you be sure?
Until the old man tells me different.
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Is it like they say?  Is he that good?
To the city.
Send some bodyguards.
Cut it out.
Maybe.
And all his works?
I do renounce them.
I do wish to be baptized.
No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
I can arrange security.
You're unlucky.
Do you recognize my voice?
I think so.  Detective squad?
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
You just woke up!
Shut up!
Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
I don't get it.
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
I'll come down.
Did you speak to my father?
You'd say if you mind?
No, I like him.
Marge, you like everybody.
I don't like you.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.
Oh, it was.
Okay.  And did we know each other?
You know, a primer.
That's funny.
Can you mix a martini?
Sure.
No, I think your mother, her illness --
I love jazz.
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
Your parents met her.
I have to go to Venice.
What?
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
No, no brothers, no sisters.
Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
I thought you'd missed the train.
Freddie drove me back in his car.
Is Freddie here?
He's downstairs.
What are you talking about?
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
I've got plans!
Ripley's plans.
Esatto. I'm always planning.
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
So cool.
So tell me.
How?
Tom, I don't love you.
Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!
Marge-maintenance.
Aye, aye.
Who is it?
It's Freddie. Let me in.
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
Good. Now you can go for a reason.
I'm well, thank you.
Far cry from New York.
Yes it is.
I think it might hurt her to know.
Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn.
Where's Mr MacCarron?
Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --
Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.
Bird. That's jazz.
My fiance.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this.
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
I think you're right.
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
Dickie?
Tom.
To the manner born.
And you, sir? Any better?
He's having an early night.
Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
What?
You've got Dickie's rings.
I can explain.
It's all true.
Do you know Tom?
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
Golly. Who's paying for this?
Excuse me?
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
Hello.
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
Emily.  Just kidding.
Right.
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Is Freddie in Rome?
I've never admitted that to anyone.
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Beating you away.
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
Just kidding. Are you alone?
Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.
I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?
You know what -- I am.
Where have you been since then?
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
Hmm. C'e questa... 
They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
I can't later.
And tomorrow?
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe.
A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
He says so many fiances.
You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
I'll fix some drinks.
I'm fine.
Or I could come back.
You try. You try talking to her.
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
I give up.
What do you want to change about this moment?
All kinds of things. Making plans.
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
Was who Meredith?
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Well that would be even better gossip.
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
And don't forget. I have the key.
...Tom is a mystery...
Yes?
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?
Of course. What happened to your face?
My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.
Even your fiance...?
Even her.
What about Thomas Ripley?
What about Ripley?
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
I don't remember the exact date.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
A few days ago.
Does he stay with you here?
31 people.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
That's an expensive gun.
I got money.
Huh?
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
Yes, mam.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
My name is Travis.
Thank you, Travis.
Where do you live?
I know. I could have picked you up.
It keeps ya busy.
You know what you remind me of?
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
The singer?
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
So you haven't heard this record yet?
I bought a couple of tickets.
What's wrong?
I'm leaving.
What do you mean?
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
I mean porno movies.
Well... mostly...
My God!
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
I'm getting a taxi.
Keep it.
Hello, Betsy.
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
Well, I hope he wins.
Yeah.
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
Oh, Tom, please.
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
Kidding around... you know, fun.
No, why?
How long has he been there?
I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
This is gotta be a game, right?
This I gotta see.
Oh, are you all right?
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
No, why?
He's Black, OK?
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
What is it? I'm busy.
Just follow me.
Awh, come off it, Pal.
No, I'm serious, really...
That's a dollar forty-seven.
The kind with a brush.
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
Could you see anything?
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
For a fee.
In the jungle. 122nd.
Nah.  I suppose not.
You looking for some action?
Well... I guess so.
A girl needs protection.
Yeah. From the likes of them.
Easy.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
What's your real name?
What's your real name?
Iris.
That's a nice name.
That's what you think.
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
Do they drug you?
Oh, come off it, man.
Don't you understand anything?
I can leave anytime I want.
But that one night?
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
That's not hard to do.
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
Pittsburgh.
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
Do I look like a narc?
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
You just gonna leave 'em?
What should I do? Call the cops?
Cops don't do nothin.
You're not much with girls, are you?
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
I sure hate to go alone...
Yes I am.
Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.
No Sir.
Got your license?
Yes.
There's porno theatres for that.
I know. I tried that.
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.
Physical? Criminal?
Also clean.
Age?
Twenty-six.
Education?
Some. Here and there.
Military record?
No, I want long shifts.
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Well then check back tomorrow.
Yes, Sir.
Why do you ask?
Sure.
Anything you say, officer.
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
Take it or leave it.
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
Funny, you don't look hip. 
O.K., cowboy.
I'm here to see Iris.
Iris?
Hey Wizard.
Slow.
Yeah?
Things got ya down?
Real down.
I know.
Like do anything, you know.
You want to talk about it?
You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
What is happening?  Where's Mason?
Don't let him do that.
Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
Tell me what you really do.
You suppose?
Yes.  You'll be outside.
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
It's all I could think of.
I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
Now they only have three rockets left.
It's about time.
An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How droll.
Hi.
Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
I am, too.
Whatever happens.
Delly?  In here.
That always used to work.
It's possible.
You look... different.
Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.
Why me?
Through the door.  It comes apart.
And why not?
Whoa.
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
What did... what did I want to be?
Yes.  Hic!
Nothing.  
Do you have the...
I'm  fine.  Really.  
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
Have you got a cigarette?
I don't smoke?
No kidding.
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
Oh.  Okay.
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
Thanks.
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
I... I need a drink of water.
Go ahead, son.
Ben, when's Delly due back?
Well, son, you're home!
Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.
Shhhhhh.
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
But what?
"It's a Wonderful Life."
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
And... what's my name again?
Nine and-a-half years...
Can't wait.
Mother.  She's beautiful.
Who... are they?
This is the staff of the Bijou.
Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
... Ernie.
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
Goodnight, son.  'Night, Delly.
Yes.
Ha!
... what?
The film broke...
I know, I know... keep still.
Did you... did you...
Did I what?
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
A few.
Vultures...
What.
The G-man?
Zackly.
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
Then I'll call you a cab.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
Thanks.
Call me... Ishmael?
Well, at least you remember "Moby Dick."
Wish I could say the same thing.
We live in a theater?
Evening, Doctor Lardner.
Oh, you mean the suit.  Harry kept all my old clothes.  Fits okay, but it's a little big.
Aren't you coming?
No, I'm not much of a dancer.
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
Thirty a month.
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
I know.  A Purple Heart.
Exactly.
Why not?
Well, that's a relief.  I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
No thanks.
Luke didn't smoke.
Why not?
What, all of a sudden, "Lucille Angstrom" isn't a name?
Nineteen-oh-nine.
I taught you that.
I can play the piano?
No, I...
No.
Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.
Thanks.
They will.  They w-w-will.
It's about me.
Oh.
What exactly did you hear?
That you got let go.
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
You mean, he was... let go, too?
You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?
Yes.  Very.
Don't mention it.  Whoever-you-are.
Who?
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
All right.  All right.  We'll see.
Yes?
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
No, not really.
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Thank you.
Yes?
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
Yes.
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
Would you like some brandy?
If you have some, I'd...
How do you like our little hamlet?
I despise it.
San Francisco.
I suspected as much.
Because she was afraid.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
I don't understand.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
That's up to you.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Look.
Just listen to them!
If your father were here...
Mom, they're in a cage!
Take them.
Yes?
Oh, I suppose so.
Could I have a puff?
I don't think your mother would like that.
Just a little one.
Are you coming to my party?
Darling, of course I do!
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
What's the matter with them?
That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie. 
Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
I don't know, honey.
Is she all right?
Shhh. Shhhhh.
The little Brenner girl.
Lois!
It's Alice, ain't it?
No, it's Lois!
It's Alice.
Morning.
Try my best.
Yep.
Where does he live?
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Yes, but where?
Where?
Yes?
And the white house?
That's where the Brenners live.
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
The two kids?
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
I see. How do I get down there?
It's a surprise, you see.
What name?
Daniels.
Okay.
The little girl's name.
The little Brenner girl?
Yes.
I need her exact name, you see.
Can I have the boat in about twenty minutes?
It's nothing.
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
Young woman cut herself.
Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
They're back!
Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke?
Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
Lovebirds, I see.
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
Whose side are you on?
I'm simply quoting the law.
And certainly pretty.
Yes.
I told you. We met yesterday.
In a bird shop.
She was selling birds.
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
Yes?
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
I know exactly what I want, Mother.
When do you think they'll come?
I don't know.
That's a chance we have to take.
Maybe we ought to leave.
Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
Where will we go?
Shhh. Shhh.
Oh, my God, look at her!
Get a rope!
I know you can.  But I'd like to.
You're doing fine.
I mean. I want to...
But they'll be back.
We won't be here.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
If they are?
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
You don't have to.
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
Cathy. At the school.
Do I sound foolish to you?
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
I couldn't ask you to.
I don't mind, really.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
Did you close the door?
And locked it.
Please.
We know what it is, Al.
Not by the thousands.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
Goodnight, Lydia.
Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
Yes.
He's not home.
That's all right.
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
I'm awfully sorry.
Lovebirds, sir?
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
The sign says strawberry finches.
Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Are they moulting now?
Some of them are.
How can you tell?
Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
But how... how do you know my name?
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
How?
We met in court.
We never met in court or anyplace else.
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
I'll find something else.  See you in court some day.
What kind of law?
Criminal.
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
Why... 
Yes?
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
How do you know Annie?
We... we went to school together. College.
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
None of your business.  Am I still bleeding?
You are, aren't you?
Certainly, but...
Seven o'clock then.
Maybe.
He was watching a ball game on television.
His wife changed the channel.
Will I be seeing you again?
San Francisco's a long way from here.
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.
So you didn't go to school together.
Yes, I was lying.
What did it say?
Yes.
Why?
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
I told you what happened in Rome!
Do you expect me to believe...?
I don't give a damn what you believe!
But not for me.
What do you want ?
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
I have several jobs.
What do you do?
I do different things on different days.
Yes.
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
I'm glad you do.
You'll think me very bold, sir.
No, tell me.
Yes.
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
No, thank you.
I'll get it.
Are you staying?
Of birds?
Certainly, of birds.
Mmm?
It was like that yesterday.
What do you mean?
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. Your sparrow is standing on a soap box and...
I'm frightened, Mitch.
No, no...
...everything I know.
At Annie's house. She's all right.
Don't let's take any chances.
We've got to get Cathy.
The bay doesn't.
How long have they been gathering there?
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Have we still got power?
Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
Inland.
Santa Rosa?
Maybe.
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
What time is it?
Almost two a.m.
You must be exhausted.
How about you?
Mitch...
Wait here. Don't move.
No... wait.  Hold me.
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
What do you suppose it is?
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
I have no idea.
What? Oh, yes, certainly.
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
To...  To kill them.
Maybe! Is it impossible?
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought... 
I'm not sure, but...
Not if they're starting a war.
They are incapable of organized warfare!
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
I haven't finished my drink.
Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
But can't you give me any idea?
I want you to help my little girl.
I'm only a student.
Did he tell you about Georgina?
Of course I will.
Yes.
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
I'm cold as ice.
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
Excuse me.
You're made for a doctor, young man!
Well? And are you not a good student?
From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
You see, it is completely out of the question.
This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
Gray killed her.
We can't be sure of that.
Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
Pulse?
That's only our duty, Fettes -- that's the end at which we aim with all this nasty business.
That's the way of it, Fettes.  You bring the lassie to me.
What do you mean, Fettes?
Gray -- I'm rid of him --
No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
It was a woman when we put her in.
Not yet.
Well --
I want it --
I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
I wanted to see the white horse --
Your son, ma'am?  He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
Don't call me that confounded name.
Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
Why don't you do it then?
Hear him?  Did you ever see the lads play knife?
You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.
I've had some experience.
But what makes a thought start?
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
This is a gift.
This is a gift you'll not return.
Get out of here!
We have never been friends.
I've drunk enough tonight.
Another little drop'll never do you any harm.
I would make you rich.
I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
I know --
Only Brother.
Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the "subjects."
No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they "Burked" them.
Any attacks of pain since?
Yes, Doctor.
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
Three years.
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
You can get out.
I'll get him.
He must leave me alone.
Where are they?
Or what? You'll bleed all over my carpet?
You sent them. I had no choice.
We won't.
Dream on.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
I was hoping you'd find out.
Yeah. I sure will.
I think we should get some support?
What? Call the police?
I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
Keep that thing away from me.
There's no scar, you freak. The Corvis kid made it up.
Where the fuck did you come from?
I don't know you, man.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
What's your damage, man? Corvis hacked up that girl like a motherfucker.
Who are you?
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.
The scar.
Why? Why's anything happen? It's all money, man. Money. The girl just got in the way.
How can you die if you're already dead?
I was talking about you.
I know her friends.
I told you, I knew your sister.
You killed that cop Dutton.
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
You killed Lauren! You killed her!
No! Why are you haunting me?
I don't want to see!
So you're going to kill him?
Have to find him first.
It's not. I can't take it.
Erin. Who?
No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
Shut up.
Good for you. You do know something.
Could say that.
The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
I mean Lauren.
Erin knows, doesn't she?
She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
Not tonight. Honest.
I want you... to bend over.
Look, can I just call a cab?
What did I say?
Just hold on to me.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
It's not that. Really. It's just... now that he's gone, I think it's time.
Watch out!
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
He said he'd prove it.
Looks like you have them both on.
It's not what you think.
You killed her!
No.
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
Please. Come inside.
What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
I assure you such power exists.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps there's some mistake.
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.
No -- I'm afraid not.
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
Where is that?
I thought that was only for bombs.
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
We can scare him more than he can scare us.
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
No -- I'm afraid not.
No foolin'? Will you?
Mr. Brady's a cop.
I'll say goodnight again.
Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
How does he explain that?
You must have come a long way.
About 250 million of your miles.
From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
You know about the United Nations?
Believe me, you don't understand. They wouldn't sit down at the same table.
Thank you... Have you any news?
Your impatience is quite understandable.
I'm afraid my people haven't.  I'm very sorry -- I wish it were otherwise.
You still haven't answered my question.
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
You ready?
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
Looks real to me.
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
Jittery is the word.
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
Naturally I think so.
Goodnight, my dear.
May I walk out with you?
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
What time is it?
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
Yes -- Just exactly.
Where is the meeting going to be?
At the ship.
Remember those words.
I -- I thought you were--
I was.
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
No. That's all finished.
I'm sorry.
There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
Would you like to sell it?
No -- no, thanks.
I'd give you a very good price.
I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
It's really quite simple... The three- body problem, you know.
Well, how do I know who you are?
Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
You better get some fresh air.
Wears sunglasses in the <u>house</u>.
He's a vampire alright.
He's my brother.
Fine!  Stay here!
We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!
You gotta drive!
Time to activate Plan B.
What's Plan B?
Zero.
The Prince of Darkness.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
El Vampiro.
They're gonna book us.
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
Two down and two to go.
<u>Four</u> to go.
Whattaya mean?
Maximum body-count.
We are awesome monster-bashers!
The meanest!
The baddest!
Honda 250, huh?
That's right.
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
Star?...
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
Why?  They're only noodles.
Get your bike.  We're going someplace.
What's goin' on, Marko?
Hey, take it easy.
Where's Star, David?!
You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
For a ride.
With him?
Yeah.
No.  Stick around.
I will, David!
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
Hit the lights again.
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
What?
There's a cop behind us.
The dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.
Sam, don't --
It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
I told Max eight o'clock.
Max?  You men we're having company again?
Right.  An' now we're having company <u>again</u>.  I'll take mine to go.
You have a T.V.?
Lots more where he came from.
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
Whatcha doin' over here?
I thought we were goin' into town.
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
I better get cleaned up, then.
This is Michael.
No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>.
No.  Just you.
I like Michael.
You better not like him too much.
For what.
For everything.
He's just a deep sleeper.
He's not breathing, Mom.
Oh, no, you won't.
No.  I'm up.
Okay.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
Mom... please.
Get out, Mom!  Run!
What's that smell?
Smells like something died.
I thought we were poor.
Not that poor.
Soon.
Can we get a T.V.?
Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
We can't talk about it on the phone.
He's already gone to bed.
Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
C'mere, Nanook.
Must be a circuit breaker.
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
Mom!
Do I look that needy?
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
Oh, right.  I always gets those two confused.
Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
It's <u>garlic</u>!!  I like garlic, but...
Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing!
Well, I...
Okay.  Talk.
I just wanted to... I, uh...
Star.
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
What do you mean?
I'm Michael.
Michael's great.  I like Michael.
No... no, everything's different now...
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
Tonight.  At the boardwalk...
Because I love you...
Then it's not too late for us...
You're not going anywhere...  Sam...
Take laddie.
Save Laddie first.
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
So do I!
That's okay, Mom.  I can see it later.  I'll help you unload.
Even poor people have T.V.s
I was here first.
Okay.  I'll flip you for it.
Nowhere.
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
What would that make Mom?
You're right... not even to mention you and me.
No.  Why?
Wanna go to the comic book store?
No.  On the phone.
Don't bother.
Nanook...
Just for a few days, Sam.  Give me a chance to work this out by myself.
The Marines.
Huh?...
Just listen.
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
Dogs don't eat each other.
I know.
Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
Yeah.
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
You're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night?
So what's our problem?
Anybody sick?
Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
I don't know who to trust.
What?
Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
Now who'd go and do...
Let go of me...
Now hold on, you dumb...
If it did get to him.
Hell no.
No.  Just let him freeze out there.
Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
Was dark... find a light...
You lying bastard...
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
Clark, you come on out here!!
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
Screw the dogs!!  Torch it!!
Look, I'm just guessing...
Well, go on.
Probably the next meal.
How the fuck do I know?!
But...
He's gone already!  Do it!
What?
Garry's missing!
Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!
You been made, MacReady.
Then kill me.
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
What do you mean "you think so?"
Then we'll never make it.
So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
All in Norwegian.
I guess I'm the only one.
I think so.
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
Enough, MacReady!
Damn you, MacReady!
Thank you.
Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
Bennings?
Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
Well, get to it.
A day or so ago... I guess.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
After all this mess then.
After all this mess.
How far's that?
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
That far?
Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
What's that?
You reach anybody yet?
No.
What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
Don't let up, Childs!
Extinguishers.
I am going after them.
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
Little over two hours.
Blair.  He's gone berserk.
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
We going to make it?
I ain't going with Sanchez.
I'm sure a lot of you already know.
He's dead.
Screw the flashlights.  Where the hell were you?
What are you going to do?  Drink it?
Anyplace but here.
Forget about Childs.  He's over.
The generator!
Screw the generator!!
Position, my ass...
Then we go after him.
Bet the last place you ever go.
What for?
You know damn well what we both make of it.
No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
Who else could have used that key?
Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
MacReady, that you?
Yeah!
Well, let's get down there.
He's one of them.
When do you think it got to him?
Hear what?
The journey is part of my work.
I had an accident.
I figured that.  What kind of accident?
On the towers?
I'm training to be a high climber.
'Fraid so.  Just a regular old... mud carrier.
Exactly like you.  Well, maybe not as healthy.
We're not supposed to think about it.  But I dream about it sometimes...
This is it?
Around here.
But there's nothing here.
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
You know of them?
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
Do you know where they live?
I was lucky.  The others weren't.
How have you survived so long?
Last night.
Send him away.
What?
It frightens you.
Yes...
It was meant to.
Yes.
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
Oh, shut up.
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
Yes.
Do you know which way?
This way.
The air... the power.
Why did they built it?
The Morlocks didn't build this.
How are your dreams now?
End...?
This has to end.
Alexander.
Created?
They survived above.  Became what they are.
Why would you let me go back?
I'm a foolish man.
Oh, you won't be running for long...
Because...
There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
I -- what are you?!
Dance with me...
You know I can't.
Trust me...
What?
Well there's something new.
I need to... um... talk to you.
Not here... alone.  May we? Please?
All right, what is it now?
I mean... well... affection.
You're getting warmer.
Hold on... I know I have it...
Dance with me...
You know I can't.
Trust me...
Holding you... again.
Darling.
Not here... alone.  Please.
No... let's walk through the city.
All right...
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
I want to get into the light, that's all.  Please...
Alex, it's just the zoo.
No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
I've seen it.
Let them.
I have something for you...
I was not.
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
God, and I'm running late --
No, I'm all bowler hat, remember?
She's gotten into your equations.
I would.
I can't do that --
I pray to God that in a week you're not here.
Good night, Alex.
His home.
All right, all right -- here -- everything --
Thank you.
Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
Mm.
He's gone to a better place.
What makes you say that?
Then you can speak slowly.
More than 800,000 years.
Why not?
Why would you do that?
You can see so many here.
Don't then have stars where you come from?
Good night.
We all have that dream.
All of you?
Every night.
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
We share everything.
Thank you.
And this is your "work"?
Yes.
I can see Kalen's point.
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
I don't understand.
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Yes.
Someone you loved very much.
If you only knew...
Yes... I suppose so.
Go back to your own time?
Mara...?
No!
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
Do you have it?!
Hello, Mr. Philby.
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
Here?
Yes, sir, he --
May I get you some --
That'll be all.
Might I ask why?
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
What are your people called?
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
I took a different route.
My father has gone to a better place.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
They've gone to a better place.
You know that's not true.
We choose to believe it.
We are what we are.
Dean Fulton...
Kalen...
What's it like where you come from?
I am.  Are you a climber?
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
No, you're safe --
They're inside --
I'm fine.
But... what about Starks?
What about Starks?
But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that?
Well, what are we gonna do about it now?
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
It's not my job to believe you.
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
Then how would you describe him, Beth? Merely rebellious?
[Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket.
Actually, that's exactly what our equipment is.
Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
My business?
Yes.
You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
You may have known my father, William Starks.
Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
Oh yeah, what'd he say?
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
They should just be looking harder.
Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
Good.
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
Mom, he just fixed our car.
Jackie, get in the car. NOW!
Just do it.
You two ok?
Our car won't start.
Yeah, but I don't know what.
[Beat] What's your name?
Jackie.
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
If you don't get out of my house right now, I'll call the police.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
How?
No, it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th, 2004.
After I...
What?
I know.
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
You think Lorenson kills you?
I don't know.
[Beat, lost] No.
There're no cars on this street.
[Beat] I don't know.
William, you're not making sense.
To the hospital.
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm gonna be sick.
Good. How's your mom?
Ok, I guess.
I'm doing fine.
I guess I'd ask you why.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
You're not crazy.
I could try to...make it stop.
No. I don't want it to.
So it's helping?
I never knew my father. Did you?
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
[Beat] I don't know.
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
My dad wrote some things down before he died.
You have no idea what's going on.
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
The future doesn't look different?
Why not?
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
You told me this was how it happened.
You have nothing to fear, William.
You still don't believe me, do you?
I do believe you...
No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...
Don't you go to jail for that?
Why?
No.
Where are you going?
Sure.
Good.
You don't have anywhere to stay?
I don't think so.
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
Of course you don't know.
Why "of course"?
[Beat] I was dropped off.
No. [Beat] Not around here.
Sure.
Thanks.
You like it?
[Beat] I do it.
Have you always been a waitress?
[Beat] Why?
[Beat] Real is overrated.
Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
You remember it?
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
That when you stopped being a nurse?
What.
Hon?
What?!
See ya.
What?
Go fuck yourself.
Yes, baby?
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
I gotta go to Little Rock.
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
You girls are in some hot water.
Yes, sir.  I know.
Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
Sure.  Maybe over coffee sometime. I'll buy.
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
Oh, great.
Right.  Where are they?
My Lord.
What's wrong?
Stop.
What for?
I'm spinning.
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
Shut up.
Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
Thelma?  It's me.
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
That sounds nice.
Well, you wanna use the shower?
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
I'm a robber.
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Who's your friend?
A regular outlaw.
Louise, honey... Where are you?  You sound funny.
Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
Christ, sure... yes!
Not yet.
Call me back.
I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
Who is it?
It's me.
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
You wanna let me see your license, please?
Yes.
Front.
Am I in trouble?
I'll call you right back.
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
What kind of stuff do I bring?
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
In case of what?
'Cause I didn't ask him.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
Get the car.
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
West.  Left.
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
It means shut up, Thelma.
So this is all my fault, is it.
Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.
Just what the hell is wrong with you?
Why are you actin' like this?
You're not touchin' that car.
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
I don't know.  I won't be.
What did Darryl say?
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
That's puttin' it mildly.
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
Nothing.  It got messed up.
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
What happened?
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Lemme see the map.
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
Yes!  I believe I am!
Litterbug.
They think we like it.  Maybe they think it turns us on.
Yeah.
What for?
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
Why not?!
Let's get it over with.
Idaho?
Now what what?
Before.
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
Always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya?
We should have just ignored him.
Nothing.  It's not funny.
What?  What's not funny, Thelma!
Harlan.
What?!  What about him?!
Thelma!
Suck my dick... Boom!!
... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
Shoot the radio!
Sorry!
Hit it.
Yeah, you want it?
Yeah.
Are you alright?
What'd I say again?
Yes, Thelma?
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
Me too.  I feel awake.
Good.
We can change our names.
We can live in a hacienda.
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
We've gone insane.
Yup.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
How long do you think that'll take?
What?!
What?!  What d'you think?!
Oh.
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
You too, sweetie, the best.
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
What?!
Way up ahead!
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
It's grand!
All this for us?
We're not giving up, Thelma.
Then let's not get caught.
What are you talkin' about?
Go.
Go?
You, too, sweetie, the best.
Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
You got that right.
Say you're sorry.
Fuck that.
Hi there!  You alright?
We're fine!  How are you?
Grrrreat!
The thing's kind of heavy.
Jeez, I didn't catch it.
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
He implied it.
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
Never?
Well once. Mary.
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
I mean since then.
I don't know.
Well why don't you look her up?
Why not?
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
You're kidding? What did they say?
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Well... at least now you know.
Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.
What?
Well think about it.
Uh-huh.
That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
Flew.  Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.
I don't know what to say.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Check.
Mints?
You know, clean the pipes.
Pipes? What are you talking about?
I'm usually too tired to be.
If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest.
Who?
Mary.
I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!
You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser.
Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
Relax, he just ate.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.
Healy, what I just tell you?
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Who the fuck is it to you?
Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over there?
Yep.
Dumbshit.
You said it, mister.  I gotta go.
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
Same here again.
By the way, what's your name?
I already know it, Mary.
How'd you know that?
It's right there on your golf bag.
Some buildings I'm working on.
Are you... an architect?
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.
Here you go.  What's that smell?
We will, but first I have a surprise.
We just got here thirty seconds ago. Isn't this stuff great?
How about -- ?
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
What?
Nah, really, it was moronic.
Warren!
Well, I know you're busy...
Don't play games with me, Ted.
You don't buy what?
She's blackmailing you, right?
No.
You can't be serious.
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
So you found Mary?
Nope. Never been.
Huh?
Four kids, three different guys.
Three different guys?
Oh, uh, I resigned.
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
I said buttplug. She's heinous.
Surprised?
What do you mean 'why'?
Answer the question, shitball.
Turn her over to a stalker.
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
You're a sick man, you know that?
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.
Same here.
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
You bet.
Did you study under Kim Greene?
Among others.
Kim and I are close friends!
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
What do you mean?
Friend. Baseball bat.
Fucking sickening.
Four.
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!
What?
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
Oh. Well I am.
Hm?
But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
No I'm not.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
I don't watch the new ones.
Why?
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Puffy, get over here.
Where's Puffy?
Where would I have seen your work?
Thanks a lot, Ted.
No, it's an old football injury.
Oh, are you on the team?
The prom -- you going?
I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.
Hi, Mary.
Oh yeah.
Just a minute.
And did everything -- ?
He's dead.
Oh... are you... ?
Hi, Ted.
Thanks.
Hm?
Oh great, I ran out.
Twenty-two.
That's more like it.  Two more nitrate-sicles please.
Trying to be.
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
Mary, come on...
Go!
Okay.
You forgot your keys!
But I think I'd be happiest... with you.
Really?
Really.
Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She just left for the prom with her boyfriend Woogie.
I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a baseball.
You got what stuck?
I think a little of both.
I don't know. It's not like it was a well thought-out plan.
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
I mean is it... is it...?
Teddy, be brave.
Oh God.
So what's up?
Eh.
I think I was very clear, Ted. If everything else falls apart, maybe.
Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
I'm gonna take a rain check.
Huh...?
Bye, Ted.
Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
Tomorrow...
Where the hell are you?
Then you'll call, right?
Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
Something your father would've come up with.
He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
We just got a second letter from Khruschev. The deal's off.
Smoke.
Kenny. It's over.
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
Cuba.
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
This is from the Highest Authority?
Time is of the essence.
48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.
All right. Then I guess it's time.
Busy. But you've got his heart.
I want an hour with him.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
I'm doing a piece on Skybolt. I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.
I'm giving you a chance here: talk to me. You can influence how this thing unfolds.
Dean Rusk!
Yeah.
What about you? Where are you going?
Back to work.
No you weren't.
I was, you bastard.
Not as far as the election goes.
Good.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
No way.
Damn right I'm scared.
They want this fucking job, they can have it. It's no great joy to me.
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
Will somebody find out what's going on?!
Hey. Nice tie.
You're my hero, Carl.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
A murder. On the reservation.
Again. Figures, man.
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
Oh, yeah -- right.
Who are you?
You're a wise-ass. Ray check his wallet.
No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh...  Ray... Little Weasel.
Tell him, Ray.
-- did you understand me when I said that --
Check him out, Ray.
Who the fuck is he?
-- a fucking cop.
I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
Good.
How'd you know?
I got one up on ya.
Go ahead.
I gave it back to her.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
Jesus, I don't know. You tell me. You're the Indian.
A long way from home. You be careful out there.
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
And get rid of the dog.
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
Yes.
-- never mind Eagle Bear. We've got Jimmy nailed. Let's go!
Cuz I want New York.
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
Let the press through.
After we've completed our investigation.
Watch out!
You're steppin' on sign.
-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
Medicine. As in medicine man?
He said he doesn't know.
Why should I tell you.
Because he was talking to me.
He saw an owl.
Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
Likewise.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
Cuz you're a cop.
Not no more.
What are you talking about?
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
What do you mean?
Nothin'. Forget it.
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
What the hell do you want me to do?!
Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.
You go to the council fire. I'm going back in.
Bullshit, let's get outta here,
We're going for The Stronghold.
That's right. Turn around.
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
Go ahead, Ray.
Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over.
Never mind.
I read, Cooch.
Ray. What's your 20?
I'm on my way back in. Over.
Mister Tully.
No. No, no. Thank you.
-- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
How the hell do you know?
Red Deer Table! What's with you, man?
That's a big comfort to me.
I could be, too.
How so?
And on to a bigger one with you?
Yeow!
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
How did you know this was my car?
I saw one.
You saw a MiG 21?
Where did you see that?
It's classified.
Where were you?
On his six.
Two meters.
You know. The finger.
You let me make a fool of myself.
What would?
And far too aggressive.
It is combat. Every second counts.
Yes. I'll give you that!
Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
Evan... or Maverick.
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
What if he's not?
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
What plane.
I'm different.
I'm starting to sense that now.
Make what?
Anything.

You're an animal.
That's true. What are you?
I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
It's not suffering anymore.
You're horrible
About as much as they think about killing me.
What?
Thanks very much.  Care for some suchi?.
Where?
You want to go ballistic?
And now I want you.
You always get what you want?
I don't know yet.
Anything.
In that order?
Well no...inverse order.
I'm still second best.
. Yeah!
Doesn't it ever bother you?
Why, what's gonna happen?
Where'd you get it.
Pawn shop. What's to eat?
This is it, then.
What?
I was flying...my responsibility.
That's what you get flight pay for.
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
Do what, show you a good time?
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
What do you want?
What?
Hardly ever.
I sit. I think. I play games.
I like to play "reality".
How does it go?
True.
Now?
Take something off.
That's up to you.
And that's one!
Your watch.
Who's gonna win?
I was, later.
I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
How could you?
Well what?
Right on the flight line?
Well?
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
F-14's sir.
Tomcats?
Yes sir!
No sir! But you have to be ready.
Remember one thing.
Sir?
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
Maintaining course. Straight for Mustang.
YEAH, COUGAR?
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
I'M UPSIDE DOWN. I KNOW IT. I'M GONNA EJECT.
Let's hope you're right!
What is he doing?
He's pissing me off!
He better be kidding!
Lordy!  Eyeball to Asshole. Hope nobody burps!
These guys are getting on my nerves.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
What is?
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
What?  What is it?
Were upside down!
You're crazy. We're level.
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
No! Now we're inverted!
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
TELL HIM, WILL YOU TELL HIM? OUR INSTRUMENTS ARE OKAY.
Saving them some paperwork.
Don't tell me okay. Do it!
BREAKING LEFT!
AND HE'S GUNNING.
I know!
Rudder's left, stick's forward.
Swell! Passing ten thousand!
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
I can recover. Hold on!
Okay.
I'm not losing it again!
280, 290, 300 knots.
You go. I'm staying with it.
I'm gonna go! THREE...TWO...ONE...
Just relax.
Is it the plane?
The plane is fine.
Is it you?
But I have to!
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
What do you want?
What do I want?
What do you want?
Any more MiGs?
On what?
Oh...I'll think of something.
Got you here.
So's my Johnson.
This is Maverick.
Who's your pilot?
Tom Kazansky.
Mister to you.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
Could use a dash more jet fuel.
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
Gotta keep track of the competition.
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
Look, Ma, top of the world!
What?
Nothing. Let's just go fight.
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
I want him!
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
Time to go.
Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
Let's go. Eject.
Come on. I died enough for one night.
They should have warned you about that one.
Pulled left, rolled out, underneath.
What now?
He won again.
SHIT!!
YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN.
NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
LOOK OUT!
GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
You saved our lives. You did it!
We did it.
Figured out what?
Who is the best.
Nope.
Need a hint?
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
But you continued to fight.
Tell me one thing.
So have I.
Some guys never get it back.
Three guesses.
What the hell you doing?
Helping him in.
Didn't everybody?
Bad?
How's it goin', Coog?
Me?
The wings..
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
Yes sir.
A good man. Good flyer.
Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
For the same reason you are.
Oh, you mean the thrill!
All right.
Goose is dead.
I called your house.
Or you can quit.
I don't know...
You may not think so, but you are.
He was by the book, all the way.
Not something they tell dependents.
It's not true.
He ain't got five kids to feed.
Over there man.
You got the job.
What was that?  An accident?
Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.
The Last Resort.
You're getting off to an early start.
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
What happened to them?
Take me to the hotel.
The Last Resort!  Quick!
But maybe you can change all that.
I think my grampa might be here.
Hey, I got four kids to feed.
Who are you?
I'd advise you to hurry.
Would you like the same suite?
Identification?
Fuck you.
We gave you lots of help.  Benny here...
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
I know that.
But I thought...
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
What is it?
You better get down here.
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
Why not?
We haven't implanted it yet.
Nice to meet you.
Eight years.
Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
Brunette.
Slim, athletic, voluptuous?
Sleazy...and demure.
Forty-one A, Ernie.
I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.
At Rekall.
Swallow this.
Any news of Quaid?
Watch your mouth, Captain.
Where?
O.K., everybody pull out!
On his way.
You tell me.
I don't know.
C'mon!
Melina!
They sell fake memories.
Oh, Rekall.
Yeah.
Well don't.
You went to Rekall, remember?
I did?
Let me buy you a drink.
No, Harry, I'm already late...See you tomorrow.
Come on, let's go have that drink.
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
Are you crazy?!  I don't know anything about Mars.
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Unh-uh, pal.  You've got yourself mixed up with somebody else.
Up to the right.
I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.
I've got Quaid.
Level 2.  Galleria.
What is it?
I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
Split up.  Find him.
Up!
Come on!
What the hell is this?
How did I get in this taxi?!
The door opened.  You got it.
Drive!  DRIVE!!
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
Quit while you're ahead.
Thanks for taking Johnnycab.
Mmmm.....
Lori, I don't believe it...You're jealous of a dream!
Nobody.
Nobody?!  What's her name?
But I'm always home by morning.
You know I do.
Let's do it.
Do what?
And you believe him?
All right, forget about it.
I'm late.
Some men just tried to kill me!
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
Let me finish!
--I got a trip to Mars.
Oh God, Doug.
They did!  But I killed them!
I'm not your wife.
The hell you're not.
It was implanted by the Agency.
And falling in love?
Implanted.
It's time you found out.
I'm here at Rekall.
Nice to meet you.
Good to see ya. Right this way.
Right.  Mars.
Come on, don't bullshit me.
I guess he didn't.
What are you talking about?
Hauser left me a note.
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
Not any more.
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
Don't be ridiculous.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
I'm not falling for it.
If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
Jump!
I used to model for 'em, why?
I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.
Oh, since when?
I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?
The reactor.
What reactor?!
Aliens built it.
Aliens?!
It's just up ahead.
Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
Some kind of mutation...?
Ready as we'll ever be.
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
Hang on, Burt.  The bastards are up to something.
That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
Cannon fuse.
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
My cannon.
Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
I think I scared it!
We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!
Damn it!  They'll sink this rig just like a boat!
Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
Well, who put you two in charge?
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!
No.  We go straight.
Could we make it to the mountains?
You're really leaving, huh?
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
Hell you did.  Your turn.
Has a lot of rain.
Do not talk to the driver.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
The new one!  That's supposed to be a girl!
Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.
Adios, bridge!
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground.
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
You're hung up again.
I am not!
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
Fifteen lousy bucks.
A man who plans ahead.
Screw you.  For all you know they could <u>fly</u>.
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
Yeah.  Where's your truck?
Okay, now, how far's your truck?
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.
Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna help you.
Chuck him out the door!  Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
Like hell you are.
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
Only if something happens to me.
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
Not yet, not yet...
No ties.
You are so full of shit...
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
Ran into the new college student, Rona.
Yeah, Val.
They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
It's...gone...!
Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.
God, what a stink!
Okay, ten dollars.
You okay?
Let's assume that it is.
Yeah.  One, two, three...
Why do you all keep asking me?
You guys do all the odd jobs.
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
LET'S DO IT!
An hour after you picked it up!
I know about Esparza.
He was your snitch.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
No it is not, Mr. Dowd.
It most certainly is.
In other words, seven times out of a hundred, you're wrong!
I have to talk to your brother.
The hell you do. At this hour?
Let go of my hair.
Where's the nearest hospital?
Bellevue. Straight up First --
So noted.
Complain to the Bar Commission.
Sustained.
I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.
Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
Oh really?
How can you remember that?
I didn't take my eyes off it!
No further questions.
A "description"? What, Asian male 18 to 30, black hair, brown eyes?
Your Honor, the witness' response was non-responsive... I ask you to strike it from the record...!
You fucking swear to shut up!
Damn right I'm right.
-- an angel dust dealer --
With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.
What other case?
Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.
Eddie... I don't know about this...
What, the lunatic who --
"Cecil Stipe." Find it.
I didn't ask for a closing argument.
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
Roger Baron.
-- What?
...What do you mean?
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
Let's get a cab.
What's Art Esparza?
I followed her from the courthouse.
I've seen this picture before.
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
...For ten years, now.
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
And I call your testimony hearsay. I have no more questions for you.
You're doing a murder case?
Kitty, where exactly do you place the microphone to catch the most incriminating moans?
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
Right.
You don't drink "booze".
You do.
I don't need sleep!
That's right.
Figures.
Racist asshole came at me.
Exactly what happened then?
I killed the motherfucker.
...Okay...
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
Maybe... because someone's afraid.
Afraid of what?
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
-- About what?
About Chinatown. What went down.
What went down?
You tell me, man.
No. You tell me, Shu.
How can I tell you what I don't know!
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
"No," what?
It's okay, Eddie.
Jimmy Chin? Was that self-defense too?
By trusting me. Shit, man...
See-cil.
Thank you, Mr. Stipe.
Mr. Rabin has no right to --
Don Reynard.
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
You're my only problem, Ed. What does it take to make you go away?
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
And who was Arturo Esparza?
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
I hope so, Mr. Reynard.
No -- leave him be. It's better for everyone.
I'm Roger Baron. I work with Edward Dowd.
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
Chuckie OD'd, Mrs. Esparza. He's dead.
-- Roger --
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
For control of the prison drug trade?
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
What is your rank within La Compania?
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
And why was an exception made?
Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
And you b-believe that.
What color hair will she have?
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
NO! GOD, NO...
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
I want you to kill for me.
Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
Here he comes.
The stuff we got last night.
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
Let's ditch this place and party.
Out back in our morgue.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
Well, where are you going?
I am going over here.
God damn, you people are confusing.
Yep, it sure is.
That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
I think I'll take off my badge as well.
YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
What?
ALBERT?
I'm up to speed, Stanley.
Stanley, I heard all about it.
No, sir, we did not.
Someone else has it now.
That would indicate that it's the future.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
Where am I? And how can I leave?
He's dead -- good and dead.
Sorry to hear it.
He didn't suffer.
No.
No.  Ask Irene over there.
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
Code, I've heard a lot about this.
Shorthand. Really?
We're heading into a difficult situation.
How do you figure?
What do you mean?
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
That's what I heard.
Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
It's not late, it's early. Really early.
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
She must have known someone.
I'll get my kit.
Yes, he is like a clown.
I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
Noooo...
The usual, 9:15.
He probably wanted to drive over.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
I don't know what to do.
You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
Oh god, Laura.
Well, why not?
James is very sweet and very gorgeous.
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
Of course...
No, I want to smoke.
You want a muffin?
Donna, you are a muffin.
No, you're the muffin.
Come on, Laura. I'm your best friend.
Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
You mean Fred and Ginger?
Dancing.
Nothing.
YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
Not you, Donna, not you.
Laura, I am your friend.
No.
How did the car get back here?
WE got it back, that's all.
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
Why do you do it, Laura?
Cause I like it.
What'll it be?
Fill 'er up.
You got it.
I haven't got it yet.
Yep...  Yes...  It is.
I did? I didn't see anything.
Yeah... look in here. Look at it from this angle.
Who would do that?
The pages are gone. That's real.
Oh, yes... yes...
Did you make me a tape?
I already made you two tapes.
I am The Muffin.
And what a muffin you have.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
We're on our way, Baby.
Let's go all the way.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
It does matter. We're in love.
We were supposed to be together.
How can I be together if I'm not together?
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
Not now.
This afternoon?
I can't tonight.
What's going on?
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
You know it and I know it.
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
Oh, Laura.
"Oh, Laura..."
You mean the ones you pity.
When he finds out.
What?
Bobby killed a guy.
See what?
No.
Hiking?
No.
Eating?
You'd think so.
Sex?
You're getting warmer.
Trees?
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
We throw away the whole head.
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
I forgot my books at school.
What?
Sure you do, it's good for you.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Good night, sweetheart.
Fine.
School?
...school's fine...
Dad...
A friend from school.
A special friend?
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
Yes.
Yes.
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.
Look at this finger here.
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Bobby didn't give you this?
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
I don't know.
That's right.
Nothing, I chickened out.
What did you say?
You're not busy, sweetheart, now go.
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
There's no one here.
Norma, are you alright?
Abrams...
I'm fine.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Nothing.
Very good.
The man's an ambulance chaser...
...tell me about this case.
We thought it was just.
You thought it was just.
Yes.
Yes. It would be.
And no one will know the truth.
What is the truth?
Mickey told me to come back to work.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
It looks that way.
You know what that would mean?
...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told you that.
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
What does it mean?
I wouldn't do it.
You would not...?
No.
Just now...
Yes.
You've just said you signed it.
You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
Neurology?
No.
Orthopedics?
I'm just an M.D.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I know of him.
How is that?
Through, through his book.
Meth... Methodology and Technique...
...of Anesthesiology?
How old are you?
I am seventy-four years old.
I'm on the staff of...
Objection.
Frank Galvin. We've met before.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
Nothing further, your Honor.
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
You may step down.
Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just tell the truth.
Say it.
I was her doctor.
...I was one of a group of...
When she...
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr. Marx, of course...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
We went to Code Blue...
Tell me one?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
And what did your team do...
Well, we...
My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
We just...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
No, you did fine.
No. No. Thank you. You go home.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
The Doctors were not negligent.
I... um...
Why is that?
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
I am on the staff of...
Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
It's a common medical term.
And you wrote that...
Yes.
Yes? Galvin, right?
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
...and you're going to do that?
Why?
I'm sorry...?
To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
Hi. How are you doing?
Four. You're great with these kids.
Mrs...
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes.
Yes...
Kathy Costello. That's my maiden name.
What did she say?
Yes.
A single hour.
Yes.
Why is that?
I was held up.
Thank you for seeing me.
That's perfectly all right.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
I had a witness disappear on me.
Defense...?
Mr. Concannon...?
Overruled...
Exception!
Still looking.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
The TV didn't work.
What Hotel are you staying at?
And what are you? A cop?
I'm a lawyer.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Really. How wonderful for you.
Yes. It was, actually.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
You just got lucky.  D'you eat yet? Come on.
Maybe I can do something right.
Is this a bad time.
...and is that serious?
Do you want me to go...?
No, no, I'm just...
I've got to work.
Isn't there something you...
That's what I am.
Yes.
I... do you want me to leave?
Is there going to be a later...?
Not if you don't grow up...
Stop pressuring me...
No.
I don't have a goddamned idea.
I have to talk to you.
Mr. Alito, please.
Let me talk to Mickey.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
How come you're calling me from...?
This is Miss Costello...?
Yes. Price...
Pardon?
Kathy Price.
We find that your subscription lapsed...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
You know what happened.
Nothing happened.
I didn't do it, Mister.
Who are you protecting, then?
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
Then why don't you testify?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
It's locked?
...I'm sure you do...
Yes. Yes, I have.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
Where is he?
Yeah.
That's for sure, Frank.
Don't touch anything.
...I'm going to need your help...
What?
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
You got a good memory, Franky.
I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
I'm going to get laid.
Oh shit, what's today?
I can't talk now.
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
That's right.
Yeah. I'm awake.
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
What difference can that make...? All right...
What did she do?
The broad has disappeared...
The Hospital...?
We got to talk.
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
She did?
I just saw her.
In New York?
What?
Yes.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
...of the procedures...
Yes, the roving nurse...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
What happened in those three minutes...?
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
Huh. And why is that?
So far you're great. You got a cigarette?
Let's go.
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
We'd be in all the papers!
Hey, how about that!
Come on out!  We're friends!
The same thing that happened on our Pacific Coast.  Anything from them yet?
I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...
There's nobody left around here now.
But I think I know where she'll be....
Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
Like...ah...
You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
Sure...get in!
It's gone now.
Where are we?
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
I have no close folks.  My parents died when I was a kid.
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
If they're mortal, they must have mortal weaknesses.  They'll be stopped -- somehow!
Hours.  I've been so scared...!
It was...  ...one of them!
What was it like?
We're right in a nest of 'em! ... I've got to get a look at them.
Maybe ...  Maybe they want to take us alive.
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
How'd you guess?
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
Have you got a pocket compass?
We better get word to the authorities and --  Look!
I believe we can get a lead from their anaemic blood.
So is the town, I notice!
I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.
It's always been a good persuader.
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
If they're more advanced than us, they should be nearer the Creator for that reason!
D.O. to number three..come in.
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
How would I know...!
Everything human don't have to look like you and me....
Welcome to California!
He's very excited about it.
The nightmares.
Sort of a trial balloon.
Come on.  Kids love horror.
And I...I've got other things happening.
I'm sure we can match any offer.
I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
Like weird calls, by any chance?
I'm sorry.  At least we're in on piece.
You get any sleep last night?
More or less.  Dylan, time to get dressed.  I'm late.
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
Hasn't been another call, has there?
48 hours.  Back before you know it.
Chase. Hi...
Chase, you'd better come home.
What?  What kind of episode?
Like Freddy.
Heather, has there been another call?
Don't speed, Chase.  It's not...
Diabetes?
No.
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
You don't understand.  If Dylan falls asleep,then...
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
You have a fever, sweetie?
What?
Rex?  Who's Rex?
I like this story.
No.  Tonight.  It's important!
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
Your bed?
No, I don't think so.  You just have to...pray, or reach...
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
Can you come with me in my dreams?
Home, that's right.
I know he is, sweetie.  We'll both go get Rex right now.
Coming for you...
Here.
A story?
I'm fine.
I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
Yeah...how'd you know?
That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
Steady...
You got it.  What's happening?
What are you talking about?
Fred Krueger did it.
Yeah, sure.
Yes?
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
I want to see for myself.
The car's no there yet?
No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
Listen, dammit.
I just can't.
Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
Captured?  How?
Then what is he doing?
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Coffee'd be nice.
Me too.
Not yet.
It's time these boys saw some real blue water.
Yep.
Your father?
You sound so sure.
I am about this.
I can take it.
We were idealists.
He has a lot of hurt inside him.
Claiming their place in the world.
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
Give me some time to blow the man down...
Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
Give me some time to Blow the man down!
Yes, Sir.
Good.  Let's go sailing.
I didn't know sir.
We've got weather moving in from the west.
Yes sir.
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
How old are you, son?
Fifteen.
It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
Yes sir.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
To take a piss.
Believe what?
Her name.  Bregitta.  It's poetry.
Yeah.  How'd you do.
Congratulations.
What about you?
Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
What?
Anonymous.
I thought this was your dream come true.
That's not why he's sending me.
Why then.
Because it looks good.
It was a bad dream...
What's the difference?
You only hurt yourself you know?
I guess.
Is it true Phil?
We all have problems.
I'm pissin' fire man.
Yes.
Passport?
Look, I just better go.
I know you will.
Maybe it's an air raid.
Fine.
Good.
It doesn't matter.  Really.  I'm just sorry you got chewed out.
Ya know... "It".
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
Kennet Square, PA.  'Mushroom capital of the world'.
My dad.
It works?
I couldn't.
I can't make it out?
What are you talking about.
Speak up boy!
Unfurl the squares!
All stop on the engine.
It was my fault.  I slipped.
Sometimes it gets exciting out here.
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
Sir...?
He killed the dolphin.
Of what?
I don't know.
So is violating international law.
But you invited is aboard.
Your cannons made a compelling argument.
Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
Take good care of my son.
Well, you never can tell these days, can you?
Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
I should be eating with the crew.
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
Why are you here?
Oh, really?
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once?
Yes.  I do.
You're officer of the watch, George.
We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
A padlock.
She's Cuban.
Why would you do that?
Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
Why'd you jump?
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
Like you'd know what to do with one.
Trust me donut.  I know.
What?  Come on...
I figured it out.
Okay donut.  Whatever you say.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
Read on, young John.  Read on. College boards are coming.
Outer.
What's that?
No.  Bring him on deck with the others.
Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.
What?
No, Phil.  It's a mammal.
It hurts too much to care.
About yourself?
About anything.
Long enough.
You've gotta be kidding?
But, they don't speak English.
No way Phil.  Not like this.
Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
Then keep your mouth shut.
You already have.  Now go on.  Do it.
What?
Up you go.  Right now.
I'm sorry...
Sorry won't cut it.
I don't know...
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
I can't be sure.
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
May I ask you something?
The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
No.  I didn't.
Then what are you trying to say then?
What's that supposed to mean?!
Artie? That you, Artie?
How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
Why? He's right in the groove.
Y'all take American Express?
Yessir.
How old are you?
Twenty.
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
You was in the Marines, huh?
Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
That'd be fine, Bobby.
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
No, haven't heard of it.
New Orleans, huh?... We was just there.
No.
You an indian?
No.
Ready for another?
Why not?
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
She really say she was pregnant?
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
Like takin' candy from a fuckin' baby...
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
That's right... Take one of these.
What is it?
Told ya I would. You still riled?
You still screwing sixteen-year-olds in the ass?
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
You heard from Reggie?
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.
What'd you say?
No, of course.
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
Maybe he'll get a little nervous, but who gives a shit?
What's the name of it?
Club Zanzibar.
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
Set one up.
You hitched yet?
No sir...
Whattaya do there?
Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
But I am also with the government.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
Only if necessary, of course, and only in my own country. 
We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
Sailor... Lula loves you.
Come here.
Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
Why not? How was the fishin'?
Hasta siempre.
The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it.
I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...
See ya downstairs.
You ain't actin', mama.
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
Thinkin' a second, baby.
Why, honey?
Peanut...
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
That don't seem fair.
Yeah?
There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
I guess.
What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.
What's that, honey?
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
It's just another case, Sailor.
You certain?
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
Who do?
You do.
He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
Do me a favor, Sailor? Don't pick up no more hitchers, okay?
We'll find out in a hurry.
Under a hundred.
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
You upset with me?
If you say so.
Trust me on it.
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
I don't know... Looks like clothes.
One bad car accident...
SAILOR!!!
You think she's gonna make it?
Yeah?
The only one.
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Yeah?
Come sit by me.
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
And Bobby too, I hear...
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
You talk to 'im some?...
So where'd you say you was?
Went with Bobby.
Uh-huh?
Let's leave here.
Rather be in El Paso than Big Tuna.
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
He's the kind liked it.
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
Shake hands with your daddy.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
What makes sense, is all.
SAILOR!!!!
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
Mama, Sailor's in deep trouble here. I just can't leave him.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Course I am, mama.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
What if I asked you not to?
Wouldn't make any difference.
What if I told you not to?
HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.
And jus when my baby's out on some Texas road with a killer.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
Santos... It isn't.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
What do you want me to do about it?
Yes.
Get rid of him?
Yes... Get rid of him.
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
That's your business... I don't care how.
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Explain it... I told you.
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
Where? In the leg?
No.
Where?
In the head.
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
Through the forehead?
Yes.
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
What?
Someone's gonna see us.
Santos... You kill that Sailor, otherwise he's gonna turn my baby against me.
Shhhhhh...  Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now...
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
Life is unpredictable.
Well?...
I ain't heard of nothin'.
Thanks...
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
So I hear.
He's right, you look horrible.
You're welcome.
How are you, Crabtree?
Your wife.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
You're stoned.
Mm.
Isn't she?
I just mean...
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
She left me. Crabs.
Left you...? Who? Emily?
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always do.
I know. He started it Fall semester.
He finished it Winter Break.
No. Not yet he isn't.
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
Shut up and drink.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
He lives with his mother.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
He heard everything we were saying.
Yes.
Hit your brakes.
Just go around him.
Where would we go?
Shit.
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
His parents.
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
It's a little late to call Admissions.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
Competence.
So sensitive.
Ye-es?
So what's the problem?
The Chancellor's here? Now?
Evidently.  Coming!
Find the jacket.
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas.
Don't touch it.
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
The hood jumper?
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
Call it a hunch.
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
He was never able to reproduce them.
In a sense.
Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...
No. But I don't think that matters.
Excuse me?
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
You must be mistaken.
Bullshit.
You did.
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
How long have you been having them?
The last month maybe.
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
And your wife left you.
Her dog, yes.
Actually, it was her husband's dog...
Better luck next time.
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
No. There's no one here.
I have to see her. As soon as possible.
Who's got a gun?
You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch.
Stop calling me Vernon.
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
Yes. But that's not why I called...
Just what? Doing a little dusting?
No. Sara, you don't understand...
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
Sounds like a good one.
It's not bad.
You're right.
This is worth it.
That's really it.
Really?
Really.
Like the lady herself.
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
I had to. Didn't I?
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on me.
He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
Miss Sloviak's.
She is. Ah. Here we go...
What's he saying?
You're welcome.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
Sure.
Who?
The guy on the phone.
What'd he say?
Yes.
That's a big book you're writing.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
Blocked.
Hm.
Well done, James.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
So where have you been staying?
The bus station.
I don't know...  Me.
Hm.
Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
Yeah, well, actually...
Maybe...
Colon cancer.
Jesus, James. Wow.
Outside Scranton.
I never heard of it.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
Kinship. And what's here?
Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
That's right. That one.
How can you tell?
You can see the outline of a butt.
Not you. Your talent.
The hell I am.
No thanks.
I don't know... 'Episodes.'
I eat.
When?
When nobody's looking.
Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
Parents? They're not my parents. They're my grandparents. My parents are dead.
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
In the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.
I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
Well, let's see if we can keep that from happening.
Yes, James.
I think so... What about you?
Me? Sure. Why?
Just checking.
James'll know about George Sanders.
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
That strikes me as odd.
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
Grady!
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
Who does?
It beats 'What's your major?'
No, it's not that, it's...
Chancellor.
I got the message you called too.
Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
All right. This morning --
I'm pregnant.
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
She's left before...
Hm.
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
Caps.
You got me.
I love you, Grady.
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
You heard? How?
Really? That was fast.
I'm kidding. Hello?
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
That... and you.
James Leer.
What's he doing out there?
I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.
And the jacket?
Over there. In the backseat of the...
Of course, I'm sure. Ah, Christ, the puberty police are back.
And what do you think you might have said?
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
He told me.
And what did you say?
I said it didn't sound like you.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
I know.
And you're old.
Dozens. It's very sad.
I told Walter.
It didn't come up.
I know, but sometimes...
Lucky guess.
It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
He's still barking at me. He's blind.
I'm your man.
Sure it is.
Tony. Now that I'm home.
What's that?
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
It's Grady, Walter.
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
This is important.
Oh?
I... I...
What is it, Grady?
I'm in love with your wife.
Excuse me?
Sara. I'm in love with her.
I don't know. It might be...
Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you?
Her husband.
Taking the long way home.
Hey, Professor Tripp.
Only when I'm working.
As a heart attack.
Thanks -- Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful here...
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
I was thinking of you.
And?
I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just... want to know where I stand.
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
Horses, right. Vernon something...  Hardapple.
Just kidding.
That's all right. We'll find him.
No, I'm going ho --
Just a few then. The big ones.
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
I doubt it, darling.
If he's happy...  I'm happy.
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
I told her all my relatives are good- looking.
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
Foreman now.
No shit.
Five years.
Beautiful. How's business?
K through sixth.
I was just thinking of... the noise.
I like the noise.
What?
Annette? She's good... tense.
When can I see her?
I'm working on it.
Is it because of Anna?
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
This little table is one heavy bitch.
It's a nice table.
The birthday party.
Ah, come on.
What's that?
Annette will see you.
When?
Soon.
Next week? The week after?
Early July.
C'mon, Walter.
I'm just talking, man.
Carlos, I never raped a woman.
I know. I'm just saying I understand.
Nothing.
Ask me. Ask me anything.
Did you ever... Do you have feelings for Anna?
I mean... feelings.
Birds.
There's a million birds here.
In that birch tree is a nest.
Is that right?
I don't like starlings.
Why not?
The mother sure has her hands full.
Their sound is quite musical.
How does it sound?
It's hard to describe.
Try.
I bet you can.
It's a bright sound.
That was terrific.
You live around here?
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
Were you watching me?
Do you come here often?
My daddy likes me home before dark.
It's good to listen to your daddy.
It's my bird book.
I have friends.
Well... not in the common way.
Cop.
Have a seat.
I have no idea.
I think you do.
Why don't you just tell me?
Then you won't mind if I look around.
Got something to hide?
Doesn't everybody?
I could get a search warrant.
If you could, you would have brought one today.
Yeah.
Okay.
What?
Yes.
Do you believe in them?
No.
I don't know.
The girl.
Know what?
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
I could take you downtown.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
What's with the boxes?
You're a cop. Figure it out.
I'd say you're moving.
It's a free country, isn't it?
Yes.
I count my blessings.
Well, I guess I'll be seeing you.
I'm adjusting okay.
Apartment's okay.
Are you taking your medication?
It gives me headaches.
But you are taking it?
Yeah.
You are in.
What?
Lovers' quarrel?
If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
Can I ask how old you are?
No you're not.
Do you have many friends?
No.
Banished... yeah.
Yes?
Are you sure?
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
That's okay... doesn't matter.
Yes.
Ms. Kramer.
Yes you can, Robin.
Your daddy will always love you.
How do you know?
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
Robin, listen to me.
Yes?
I don't mind.
You should go home.
Can't I stay a little longer?
It's getting dark. Go home.
Will I see you again?
The job's okay.
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
You seem a little hostile today.
That was a joke.
That's right.
No way.
Why not?
Ev-i-dence.
Of course.
It was just an idea.
Bad idea.
That's right.
You think reflection is good.
It's very good, indeed.
How's that?
No fucking way.
Then think about it.
I'm still thinking about it.
I wish you'd give it a try.
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
I don't feel anything.
Have to talk about something.
I'm not that crazy.
Do you think you're crazy?
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
Is that what you are angry about?
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
We have a few more minutes.
I mean, when will I be normal.
We have a lot of work to do.
I couldn't say.
You couldn't say.
I'm afraid not.
Do you know what "normal" is?
How do you define it?
I don't.
How do they know?
What is your idea of being normal?
What is your idea of being a Jew?
I know --
You don't know!
I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
What did you think would happen?
I don't know.
What did you want to happen?
I don't know!
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
I want you to calm down.
I want to talk about it now.
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
Sorry.
Please don't do it again.
I said I was sorry.
You mean my problem?
That's not a helpful answer.
That's my answer.
I'm relaxed.
Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
In your mind, Walter. Take your time.
I see my sister.
Sorry.  Where is she?
In my bed too.
We're little kids.
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
All right.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
I'm only asking questions.
Yes.
I was six years old!
I meant later... when you two took naps.
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
I smelled her hair. That's it. I just liked smelling her hair.
I feel... okay.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic.
I'm all right.
It's fucking freezing out here.
I'm talking about you.
Me?
Yeah, you.
Most women wouldn't choose it.
Guess I'm not like most women.
I'm just quiet.
They're all assholes.
I thought you were a dyke.
What do you think?
What?
K through sixth.
Doesn't it get noisy?
I like the noise.
What about them?
They could eat you.
Yeah, they could.
You're damaged.
I get that impression.
So... what's your dark secret?
Why do you want to know?
Don't you think I should know before we have sex?
What?
Not tonight.
You're still here.
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
Do you?
It's been a while since...
Since you've had sex?
Maybe later.
How about in the morning.
The morning?
I thought I'd stay the night.
What for?
I suffer from insomnia.
Is that all?
Hi.
Because I like you.
Yeah.
I molested little girls.
Molested little girls?
Yeah.
Twelve years in prison is no joke.
It's not what you think.
How young?
Twelve years in prison?
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
Get your kicks somewhere else.
Hey, I'm not --
Depraved? My mistake.
Walter.
Yes! I want to know.
Why young girls, Walter?
Their power. They seduce me.
They seduce you?
I was always the one seduced.
You really believe that?
No. That's what I used to tell myself.
And what do you tell yourself now?
Nothing. It's over.
What?
Being here, with me.
I know.
The percentages --
Which brother did this?
You must hate your brothers.
I love my brothers.
No you don't.
Are you serious?
Not ever?
Not ever.
Us seeing each other.
Neither am I.
Maybe you should be.
Live together.
Move in with me.
I think it's a fucking good idea.
Who doesn't?
That's not what I meant.
What's it look like?
You're such an asshole.
I'm not scared.
Prove it.
Do what?
Sneak up behind me like that.
What's your fucking problem?
Why's it always my fucking problem?
Nothing.
I need a shower.
Yeah.
Fucking liar.
Not when they fly.
I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
Piece of cake, baby.
Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!!
No way that could just be seawater.
I'm alright, I'm dealing.
Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.
Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
Hey, you okay?
I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
Not for long.
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
That must be it.
Oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years with me.
I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
But what did he see that made him panic?
What do you think he saw?
I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!
Yeah?  Well I'm not.
It's trying to communicate.
Now what?
Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
Yeah.  So sue me.
Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
They'll come out after us.
Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.
Calm down, Bud.
I don't know how!
We've only got one suit.
No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
FUCK LOGIC!!
WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
Tell me later.
Hi, lady.
'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
I've been better.  Next time it's your turn, okay?
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
Let's go, guys.
Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
No.
God, I hate that bitch.
Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
Everything is.
Do we just leave him there?
Why bring it here?
Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
Meet me in the moonpool.  Move fast.
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
Yuh?
Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
Turn it up, bozo.
Give me that!!
Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Wilhite, anything?
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?
What's you depth, Cab Three?
Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
Check this out.
Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.
Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
She'll wait.
Fine. Can't you see so yourself?
A little more so this time.
I'm thirsty.
What! After giving us such a run around...
This one is gorgeous.
Then why don't you try it on?
We'll send the raft back to you.
Four or five days.
You already know what they are.
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
That must be Basiluzzo.
Well, what?
Have you decided?
More so than the shark?
There's no comparison.
That seems to apply to you also...
How should I be ... arrogant?
And why haven't they left each other?
Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
Yes, very much so.
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Occasionally, but always with affection.
Then I'll go with you.
Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...
Me... I... I... Please leave me alone.
Then why do you say them?
I don't know about that. And then, who's interested in beautiful things nowadays?
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
Yes, yes, yes, yes... Right away...
Okay. In a few minutes.
Nothing.
Why?
No reason why...
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore.
Why?
I'm too sleepy.
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
Tell me once more.
I don't love you.
I would say he's pretty depraved.
Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a child.
Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.
But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
Do you consider that a compliment?
But then why did you bother changing?
Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
What do you mean by sensible?
It means being without money.
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
To the shark.
But for what reason should I come there?
But why all nudes?
I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.
I detest comparisons made with oil.
You must know your third grade geography book inside out.
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella.
Really! So that you can stuff it with your geraniums.
When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal.
What is it?
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Ask her.
Here I am.
And where do you find the models?
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
Me... Goffredo, you're mad!  He's mad.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
No, not like this one.
Unfortunately, no.
Well...probably at the last stop, which is Noto.
No. The owners are in Australia.
But where did you come from?
What boat?
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
And how come you're up so early?
Early? Is four in the morning early for you?
They didn't seem too good.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
Lady Patrizia!
Take it easy, Raimondo. Why are you getting so impatient?
Yes. Until proven otherwise.
I would like to ask you something.
Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
You're kidding!
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
No.
Through someone else?
Yes.
Who?
I can't say.
Why?
She'd punish me.
One of the other Sisters?
No.
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
I'm a blimp.
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
He loves you the way you are.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
Who told you this?
It's a sin to be fat.
You've got to eat something Agnes.
No I don't... the host is enough.
Yes, of God.
Why?
I don't know.
Dear Jesus...
Why?
It made them holy.
I burnt them.
Say it!
What do you mean?
It's not my time of month.
Should you see a doctor?
I don't know... I don't know...
No I don't.
I just heard you.
That wasn't me.
Was it Sister Marguerite?
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
Let's talk about something else.
I don't know.
Anything... may I sit down?
Yes.
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Yes.
Who?
Everyone.
Well, who in particular?
Right now?
Uh huh.
I love you.
Oh, there are so many.
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Do you think he loves you?
He's told you?
Yes.
At least once a week.
And you like that?
Where do you meet?
In the confessional.
Would you like to talk about it?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
I don't know.
How were you sick?
Something I ate.
Did it hurt?
Yes.
Where?
Down... there.
And what did you do?
I went to my room.
And what happened?
I got sicker.
And then what?
What baby?
From their heads...
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Where'd it come from before that?
From God.
I... I don't understand.
Agnes, how are babies born?
Don't you know?
Would you like to ask them?
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
Anything.
Martha Louise Livingston.
Are you married?
No.
Would you like to be?
Not at the moment, no.
Do you have any children?
No.
Would you like some?
I can't have them any more.
Why not?
I've stopped menstruating
Why do you smoke?
Does it bother you?
No questions.
What?
No... do you?
Why should I?
I don't know.
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
Oh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes ... wait a minute... Agnes slow down.
Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
Somebody told her.
Who?
I don't know.
Agnes...
You'll laugh.
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
Do you?
No.
No, but I can never tell her that.
She'd get angry.
I could never be a mother.
Why not?
Because I don't want one.
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
Is that what she said?
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
Not my fault.
What the child?
Everything... I don't have children.
Agnes...
But you're troubled... aren't you?
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
Sometimes, yes.
I'm always bad.
What did you do?
You can tell me.
I can't.
She's dead isn't she?
Yes.
She can.
How?
She watches... she listens.
Yes?
... makes me...
Yes?
Yes.
And that you're stupid?
Yes.
That you're a mistake?
She says my whole body's a mistake.
And then...
What?
Are you pretty?
Yes.
Agnes, you're stupid.
No I'm not.
Are you intelligent?
Yes I am.
You're a mistake.
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
As much as Mother Miriam does?
As much as God loves you.
Who am I?
Doctor Livingston.
And why am I here?
To help me.
Of what?
Of telling you.
It came out of me.
Did you know what was going to come out?
Because I was afraid.
Why were you afraid?
Because I wasn't worthy.
To be a mother?
Yes.
Why?
I can't tell you that.
Will she be angry?
She made me promise not to.
You don't like brussel sprouts?
We went to chapel for vespers.
Hm hmm.
Someone's following me.
Who?
Sister Marguerite I think.
A crucifix.
Do you know who put it there?
For me to get sick in.
Are you ill?
Yes.
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
I have to throw up...
I don't know which one 
Of what?
Is someone in the room with you?
No... don't hit me please...
What did she mean?
Why?
Him.
She'd seen him too.
Where?
Yes.
Yes.
Agnes who did you see?
I hate him...
Of course you do. Who was it?
I hate him for what he did to me.
Agnes, who did this to you?
Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
I don't remember.
I put her to sleep.
H... how?
???
What?
Look into the convent records.
Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.
Larry there's got to be something missing.
What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
You got to be crazy.
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
I'll have a decision by next week.
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
I'll have it.
Next week.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
It's your favourite...
Who are you?
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
Who are you?
I... I'm Martha, Mama.
The one up on the third floor?
Uh huh.
Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
Do you still go to church?
What business is it of yours..?
Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
... Thank you.
Two packs a day.
I can beat that.
Unfiltered.
No-one.
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
Is that normal?
Yes.
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
I haven't a clue.
What man had access to her?
None as far as I know.
Was there a priest?
Yes, but I...
Could there have been anyone else?
Obviously there was.
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
I believe Agnes is different.
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
And in your eyes?
Who?
That possibility never occurred to you?
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
And you weren't shocked?
I was appalled, just as you are now.
She stopped eating completely...
About two years before.
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
What?
Nuns... you hate nuns.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
The Catholic Church...
I am...
What?
Aquittal.
How?
Oh, some time in January.
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Take at look at it.
Was the child full term?
Oh, Dear God...
What is it?
The sheets...
What sheets?
About what?
Your niece!
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
Listening to angels?
Do you know what she did to her?
I don't think I care to know.
She molested her!
Because I didn't know... 
Oh, God.
I'd like yours too.
Don't deny it!
I haven't decided yet.
The woman's health is at stake.
Her spiritual health.
Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother, huh?
Bullshit yourself!
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
You just said...
And what has that to do with it?
No, because I... yeah, yeah I left the Church cause I had freckles.
I'd love one.
All right?
Fine thanks...
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Even Christ would partake socially.
Saint Peter?
Pipe!
Right...
Mary Magdelen?
And Saint John would chew tobacco.
Do you want to become one?
Become?  One is born a saint.
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
I'd like to begin.
Begin what?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
Would it stop you if I did?
Of course.
Then let's begin.
NO... no... I said leave her alone.
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
For Agnes.
You think she's a saint?
Who is he?
Why must he be anybody?
My God, you're as crazy as...
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
Don't be ridiculous.
Well give me a reasonable explanation
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
Where is she?
Hasn't she had enough?
My God, but you're determined.
Why do you insist upon pressing...
Was it you?
Is it because she's a nun?
Did you know she was pregnant?
I didn't guess until it was too late.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Too late for what?
I don't know... too late to stop it.
The scandal...
You wanted that child out of the way.
I left it with her and I went for help.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
She can't remember.
What happened to the baby?
Wasn't it!
... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...
Eh?
Lay them down.
We'd be thrown out.
They are?
The cards... you're bank.
Eight and two thirds.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
Well --
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Just you?
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
Oh, it's all right.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What they like?
I'm a deserter, too.
Oh.
Read 'em!
Sixpence.
He'll be pulp by now.
They'll be here.
Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
Well!
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
I see you go to the night court.
I've made the scene.
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
Bag-snatcher.
You do - repeatedly.
Do I snore?
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
I'll have a bash.
Yeah, grotesque.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
Have I said something amiss?
It is, y'know.
Oh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all.
Yeah, she was fickle.
No, straight up.
I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
Ah well. Eh, look!
He's sulking again.
Wake up!
You crawler.
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
He hasn't.
The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
Sorry.
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
Follow your impulse.
I'll look in here again.
Come here.
It's Paul's grandfather.
Oh aye, but I thought ...
Well, what happened?
Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
Go away! You've spoilt it.
Oh, sorry I spoke.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
How'd you guess?
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Is it ... is it, really?
Are you pulling my leg?
Something like that.
I see.  Do you like the play?
Thank you.
What's that mean?
Oh aye, a sledge.
No ... I wouldn't say that ... just like an actress ... you know.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
See you.
Of course.
Parading's better!
Parading?
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
A book!
Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
I'm not wrong.
I'm going parading before it's too late!
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
That's what they want you to think. All coppers are villains.
Lip reading.
What are they saying?
Nothing good.
You see, sly villains.
Hello.
He can talk then?
I'll look after meself.
Oh, well that's all right.  What?
Yeah ... so what?
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
That's all right then.
Oh yes, he's clean all right.
For Ringo.
Hiding.
That little old man.
Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
He's got you worried, then?
Shall I?
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
Foreign devil ...
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
You needn't bother.
Y'what?
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
You're a swine, isn't he George?
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
No ... he's must have slipped off somewhere.
Ah, go on, you swine.
We were going to do it.
Aye, well, now! 
Come on speedy!
Sit down, the lot of you.
I would though.
Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.
Hi, our lot!
Aye, let's try the dressing room.
You've got a midnight matinee.
Hello.
Oh you are, I know you are.
No, I'm not.
You are.
I'm not, no.
Well, you look like him.
Oh yes.
And my nose...
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
That's what you tell me.
What have you heard?
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
Is it? Is it really?
Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
Aah, shurrup, misery!
Oh, leave off!!!
Temper! Temper!
Well ...
Since you ask, yes.  Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.
He'll get over it.
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
Don't exaggerate.
You've lost him.
Aren't we ...
Don't start. Look.
Sorry.
Someone put it on me.
But...
Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
Well, you stick to that story, son.
I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
Well, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ... 
Paul's grandfather.
Down the ... er ...
Oh, down the ... er ...?
Yeah, down the ... er ...
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
What?
Nerves.
Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
I'll set John on you!
Oh, anything you say, Paul.
A proper Aborigine.
Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
Is that you, Roby?
Yeah, it's you all right.
Kill drive engines.
Or something will be able to see us.
Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
Do you remember the pyramid?
Sandy, scan the whole sky.
Dell, plot our location.
Where the hell are we?
That's what I'm going to do.
Yeah.  Two hours.
Gravity?
It's... basalt.  Rock.
Then take her down.
Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
No, you'll follow me.
But functioning.
Take a look.
You want to try?
Sure.
Can you see anything in the hole?
Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't talk now.
Wretched.  What happened to me?
Don't you remember?
<u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
A voice transmission.
Play it for us, please.
Unknown.
Hold it, I can't hear a damn thing!
Has the hull been breached?
Hard to say.
Well, get started.
Right.  Talk to you.
Yeah!
What?
That way.
Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
Dead.
Dead!
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
Hurt!  How?
Is it alive?
What was that?  What the Christ was that?
The water will still recycle.
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
And when will you be ready to do that?
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
Here, let me try.
What?
The engines are fixed.
Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
And be right back.
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
How does he breathe?
It's eating a hole in the floor!
Hell of a defense mechanism.  You don't dare kill it.
We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
Boy, that's terrific.
Ask him.
Careful, don't get under it!
I'll come with you.
He's running a fever.
Still unconscious?
Yes.
Got a better idea?
Oh my God.
Does anybody know what happened?
It's time for drastic remedies.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing.
Let me go first; you stay behind me.
I've completely lost their signal.
Can you get them back?
I'm trying.
What do you mean, no?
We're not going anywhere.
Three blips!  They're coming this way!
I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled.
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
I think it's fizzled out.
Hey!  what about the film?
Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?
We sure need this flamethrower.
It's not going to work.
Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
You lead.
My signal's fading.
How far?
Who knows?
Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
Can you see anything?
<u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!
What is it?
Yes, thank heaven.
Is it still dripping?
It appears to have healed itself.
We're going into the freezers now.
Maybe we could write it together.
Come on -- let's go above and see how they're coming with the gear.
They're on the next level up.
Let's get moving with this net.
Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
Could be some kind of venom, or poison...
Yeah?
Sandy, contact traffic control.
Well, it's finally happened.
Turn on navigation lights.
Engine room, what happened?
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Any microorganisms?
Not a one.  It's dead.
Anything else?
Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
Good.  I'm getting you clear too. Let's just keep the line open.
Found what?
What killed it?
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
Oh well... you know me.
Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as the engine's fixed --
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --
Up one kilometer, Jay.
That's okay, he can remain in hypersleep until they're ready to treat him.
Food-storage room!
We're coming!
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
By eating our food supplies.
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing.
Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
... More spores coming.
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
What did it do to you?
I'll get you out of there.
No... don't...
What can I do?
Kill me...
Yeah...
Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
Is it dead?
I told you we... what's that?
Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
Wait a minute.
Thanks.
Yep...
What's happening?
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
We're what!?
Too many.
We're not gonna make it, are we?
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
And?
Get her on-line.  Now!
You win some, you loose some.
Match it!
Nooooo!
Has anybody talked to them?
Not yet.
Do it.
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
Yeah?
I dunno.
What?
Take a look at this.
What?
Just got a reading...
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
What?
I'll come with you.
Anything you say, Mammacitta.
Yeah, I got it.
What's wrong?
I'm picking up another signal.
How?
It's alright, it's cool...
Is it still moving?
Uh-huh.
Looks like it.
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?
No, not really.  More sort of the  'claustrophobic' type.
And before that?
Six month stint on Datus.
Only six?
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
Real man' drink.
Want some?
Check out the tent.
Hold on...
Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?
Detour.  Other way's blocked...
Don't wait for me!
You have to...
No!
Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
'Bout five minutes.
Give me a yell is something happens.
You got it, cowboy.
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
And what is your name?
Phoebe.
Phoebe?
I call myself Phoebe.
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
Eddie what?
I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
I believe I will.
Just some coffee.
Just like that.
Aren't you?
Frankly - yes.
You know me better than that.
Paved with what, then?
Stars.
Almost four.
Why not?
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
Lloyd and I.
It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
You have no right to say such things!
- and artistically, the most promising! Eve dear, this is Addison.
She doesn't know.
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve!
I don't know what I take you for anything...
Yes, you did. You still do.
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
I can't believe my ears...
A dull cliche.
Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out.
Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?
Yes, Addison.
Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.
You can have one at Max's.
I don't think I'm going.
Why not?
Because I don't want to.
It's the same thing, isn't it?
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler," can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler...
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink.
Because that is what they are. Go make him happy.
You next move, it seems to me, should be toward television.
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
And too many of them are produced.
Then you've heard too.
I was there. An eyewitness.
You were there? At the play - last night?
Margo? Lunching in public?
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
We have that in common.
Then you two must have a long talk-
Being violently ill to her tummy.
Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
Didn't you know?
Of course I knew.
It just slipped your mind.
Frankly, I don't remember.
Just slipped your mind.
To the best of my recollection, neither your name nor your performance entered the conversation.
Huh?
This is Eve Harrington.
Where?
Right here. A minute ago.
That's nice.
Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
Everything... everything's so funny...
I'm a junk yard.
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
Like a nylon lemon peel-
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
Huh?
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
As of this moment you're six years old...
Call me when you get in...
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
You're my girl, aren't you?
When - when are you coming back?
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
I get a party, don't I?
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
How is Eve? Okay?
Okay.
I'll check with Eve...
Cut it out.
Remind me to tell you about when I looked into the heart of an artichoke.
I thought you were going to be late-
When I'm guest of honor?
I had no idea you were even here.
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
For instance - you!
Nothing, really...
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
What's all over?
The audition.
You wouldn't understand.  How was Miss Caswell?
The kid. Junior.
Gone.
I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
I mix what I like.
Okay. Mix.
What a body, what a voice.
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
Don't calm down.
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
I'm trying terribly hard.
Tell that to Dr. Freud! Along with the rest of it...
I've been aware of that for some time.
I'll say.
Don't be condescending.
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.
You were great.
I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
Pass me the empty bottle. I may find her... why, look. There's Rasputin.
What would you like? Texas?
Groom.
Yes, dear.
A married lady.
With the paper to prove it.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
I just wondered.
Just wondered what?
Why.
Why what?
I don't have to. I want to.
Is it the money?
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
It's only one picture deal.
So few come back...
Also Addison deWitt.
Every day.
Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
From what would I be running?
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
When I told you what every young actress should know.
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
You're quite a girl.
You think?
No thanks, Birdie.
A diamond collar, gold sleeves - you know, picture people...
They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square...
I never played Fort Sumter.
Buy some.
The same size?
Of course!
Oh, brother.
If I haven't, I'll find something till you're normal.
Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
See you home...
Just because you can't even work a zipper. It was very thoughtful, Eve, and I appreciate it-
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
Hmm?
Do you want an argument or an answer?
No.
Now you want an argument.
She works hard.
Night an' day.
She's loyal and efficient-
Like an agent with one client.
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
How do you mean that?
You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
Don't be dense. The party.
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
Miss Harrington...
What are you doing here?
I - I guess I fell asleep.
That's all.
You probably won't believe me.
Probably not.
It was for my report.
What report? To whom?
Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
I'll just pick up the broken glass.
How long does it take?
With changing and everything, a little over an hour.
I don't care if I never get home.
You rest. I'll get it...
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
He's the best.
She's got to meet you-
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
Not at all.  Margo, this is Eve Harrington.
My husband...
Try...
It couldn't possibly interest you.
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
I'd like that.
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
Karen.
I think she would cheer.
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
They'll do as they're told.
You won't forget it?
I won't forget.
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
They certainly don't waste much time.
Nothing definite yet - it's just to have lunch.
I don't intend to be.
Can't we sit down? Just for a minute...
Oh, but there is-
Why shouldn't you?  Please sit down.
I'm not crying.
- an understudy's performance.
He can help you.
Something most important you can do.
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
I don't think anything in the world could make me say that.
Over my dead body...
Thank you, Karen.
How do you do, Mr. Richards.
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
The curtains. I made them myself.
They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
That's my job.  See you at tea time...
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
I wouldn't like.
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
I had no idea you knew each other.
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
She's just outside the door.
The heave-ho.
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
Roughly ten minutes.
Three or four miles...
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
Not many car either, not much chance of a lift...
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
It doesn't matter.
I detest cheap sentiment.
We've all seemed a little tense lately...
He's in love with you.
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
Isn't that what they always say?
With tears.
You'll be there, won't you.
Loud.
In a minute...
Eve?
If we could cast it properly, that is...
Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve.
No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
Margo!
I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
Nothing much. She apologized.
Nothing...
Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
... Among so many quiet qualities.
Shucks. And my autograph book is at the cleaners.
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
When you do, let me in on it.
The play? All right, I guess...
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
Twentyish. It isn't important.
Don't be evasive.
Margo, you haven't got any age.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-
I'm sure.
She was a revelation...
To you, too?
What do you mean?
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
I have no intention of having an accident!
It's not important whether you do. We are wearing long underwear.
You know, she probably means well, after all...
She is a louse.
I mean really, deeply angry...
I don't think I could be.
Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
That's right, but I don't understand-
Go ahead, please...
I just played it.
Play it again.
But that was the fourth straight time.
I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
Poor Max. Heartburn?  It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
A couple of weeks.
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
Give Eve Harrington job in you office.
I promise.
That's my Max.
Answer my question!
I said I'm a dying man!
Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill!
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
--it was fine the way it was--
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
--no way--
--read 'em both and you'll see--
Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
Yeah?
Fuck you, Carl.
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
Let me lay a little theory on you--
Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
Hmm.
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
--a spy, you mean?
The fucking New York Times.
--see?--
--I'm trying--
--fifteen phone calls--
--you do?--with access to records?
You're not a kid anymore.
I never scared anyone before.
Anything you've got.
And I'm a Republican.
Sure.
Who'd you vote for?
When?
'68.
Nixon.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
That happens to people.  OK, go on.
And I'll just shitkick in my usual way.
--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
--shit--
--we gotta top the Times--
--I know, I know--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--has he got an ax?--
We're inside the White House now.
Who?
Haldeman.
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
It's nothing personal, though. 
Hmm?
Goddamnit!--
--what time is it?
11:30.
Oh.
The telephone calls... we know about that.
I'm so glad.
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
He is not in the car.  Sorry.
That's right.
Mind if I try?
When did he hire you?
I didn't do anything wrong.
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
But you know who did.
Sure--off the record.
On the orders of Haldeman?
--what about you?--
Give me your checkbook then.
It's right under that pile.
There's always a later plane.
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
I don't know what they'd do to me.
Just let me get a match.
What do you want to know?
No games, Irwin; give.
Just tell me about the goddamn article.
--they're worse. That's why I quit.
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
I will not talk about the other two.
Kalmbach--Nixon's personal lawyer.
--this'll only take one second--
I'm not your source on that.
--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
I don't know titles.
--what do you think?--
Electronic surveillance.
OK.
--you have nothing more to say, I understand that.
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
You're a lawyer and you're here--
I have nothing more to say.
You don't mind getting on people's nerves, do you?
Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
Yes, sir.
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
--yes, yes, what is it?
James McCord.
Will you step forward, sir. 
Where?
Government. Recently retired.
Where in government?
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
Where?
The C.I.A.
Are you sure?
But it's possible.
It is.
I really want to know.
Two o'clock, work the phones 'til you go.
Lotsa hints--
--well, Sloan--
Howard--
--remember Toronto, Harry.
That was awhile ago.
--political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--
--can we use their names?--
I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
Larry Young, a California lawyer--
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
A girl. Melissa.
You work there, Miss Abbott.
I'm not Miss Abbott.
No, it was good.
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
Thanks coach.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
-- Thanks, coach --
Sure.
Suck me...beautiful?
When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
Pardon me?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Single malt?
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
Yes ma'am, I am.
Yep.
Uh-huh.
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
No idea.
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Just go!
Why is this?
You're gonna shit your pants!
Charming.
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
You can call me Oz.
Do I have to?
What's your middle name?
Forget it.
Come on!  I won't tell.
I'm glad you think so.
You don't like it?
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
Because I want to.
Stifler told me.
You talked to Stifler?
...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
You want onions?
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
Sure.
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding.  So I guess...I'll see you later.
I'm not playing.
You're missing the game for us?!
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
You called me Oz.
What?  We both have cars.
You got it, stud.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
No you haven't.
But that one time --
Of course.
Do you love her?
Did you guys hook up or something?
Are you kidding?  No.
Then what the hell are you talking about?
I do, baby, I do.
Yeah, that's right.
Uh...
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
You think she was serious?
Finch, you got the Latin homework?
It's all good.  Breath check.
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
But --
Sorry, I thought you were dead.
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
Right.  That gives us...
Exactly three weeks to the day.
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
Went home to shit.
He's going in!
Holy shit!
She's already on a plane back home.
You fuckin' rule!
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
You're not...busy?
Dad, come in.
Do you know about the clitoris?
Yes dad.
Okay, well that about covers it.
I know.  Hey Nadia.
Michelle.
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Okay.  You want a story?  Here's a story.  Stifler finds this beer, right?  And...
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
No -- Kevin, you?
So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
So do I, Kev.
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
After high school.
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
Did you see that Central chick? Brunette?
I thought so.
Okay.
Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
Shame on you!
Uh...yeah...sorry.
For me?
Move with the music.
Um...okay...
Oh no.
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They arouse me very much.  But not as arousing as you.
God dammit, Stifler!
Check-out time!  Please vacate the room.
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
You got in.
Okay, don't stop.
Not for you.
Yes!  I'm a shithead!  I'm a complete and total shithead!
Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
Just a second!
You want to do it?
Yes --
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
It's like a six or seven hour drive. That's easy, I don't mind driving.
Kevin...  I want to have sex with you.
Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
Yeah, are you?
Yeah.
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Yeah.
Me too.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
Yeah, right here.
Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
I love you.
Yeah.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Does it tell me how to get laid?
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Ready for what?
What?!  How do I do that?
You've just inherited The Bible.
Once, in church, dude.
You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic.  This was before the cheesy remake.
I'm such a loser.
That's the spirit.
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
Observe.
I don't care.
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
I think we're falling in love.
Fuck yeah we will.
Stifler!!
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Shut the fuck up.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Dude, watch me work.  They go for sensitive studs like me.
I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
No shit.
Thanks.
Uh huh.
Uhh! Would you die already!
The key is don't look down.
Also like sex with my wife.
Would you shut up?
But you better hurry.
It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
No it isn't! You're dead!
What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?
What?
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.
You must get out of here. It's not safe.
Serafine...?
It's okay. I can see fine.
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Are you okay?
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
I don't... I... I can't remember...
What?! He told you? When?
A cure?
Guess that's why he hid it there. Let's go.
Fuck me...
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
Where?
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
What?
Well, they are French.
Right.
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
You too.
Andy...
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
No... I...
Shit!
Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
You'll never get the chance.
Sure. Don't you?
Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
Why isn't it doing anything!?
What?!
Oh shit... No...
This is... it's like a sick joke, I -
I leave these open. Maybe something comes back to you.
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
Yeah?
I told him it wasn't ready...
Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
That's McDermott, but yeah.
Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
Yes sir.
He says -
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
I was showing Sonya something . . .
What were you showing her?
How to read.
I know, but I had to because . . .
It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
Get on! Anastasia, get on!
No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
I'm not sure but look. . .
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
I'm fine.
You must have.
Come out! I can do alterations.
You'll laugh.
I shant!
Not you. Him.
Poor Meetoo!
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
I have my reasons.
I was all out of dynamite!
Why?
Trying... to... breathe...
Now just get off the train.
No!
You shouldn't have pushed us!
The dessert fork!
Sad?
It's okay. Didn't hurt..
I'm glad you	did too.
Anya... where are we?
I'll never let go!
THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
And what do you want, my little rat-with-wings?
Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive.
How do you know?
Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
Bartok... a question.
What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
We will.  We <u>have</u> to.  Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
Look!
Ew. . .  the honest type.
Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
Pray he's color-blind...
Ah! Let us begin!
If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
It worked in Odessa...
Are you feeling all right?
Run, Anya -  go...
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
I should go
She does.
And tell me that she's happy.
Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could.
I had nothing to do with it!
You gave the orders!
I did no such thing!
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
This guy's on television! Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
I need a large polo mallet!
You don't want my autograph.
It's for my brudder.  Alvy Singer! Hey! This is Alvy-
What?
This is Alvy Singer!
This guy, on the Johnny Carson show.
Alvy Singer over here!
Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
What do you mean, next?
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
Yeah? Allison what?
Yeah, Earl Warren?
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
Two hours? No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in.
Well, stop listening to him.
How can you possibly oversleep?
The alarm clock.
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?
Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.
What-what-what-what's the matter?
I-you know, I don't wanna.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Oooh! Here! Here!
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
All right. All right. All right.
All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
Well, then, w-who was?
Hey, that was last year.
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
Oh, I'd say so. You married-
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
Oh, no, I have a car.
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
Yeah, well, I'm, but I...
Oh - you're an actress.
Well, I do commercials, sort of...
Right!  Where?
Wisconsin.
Uh, you're driving a-
Well, where is it? I-
Okay, that's good.
I'll getcha a piece.
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Nice car.
Huh?
You want your tennis stuff?
Huh? Oh... yeah.
You want your gear? Here you go.
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Yeah, my grammy.
Your grammy!
Well... thank you again.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I'll see yuh.
No, I got time.
Okay.
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
M'hm...
Oh, sorry.
Neat, yeah.
...and... uh, yeah, uh... uh, you know, I-I-I...
No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Fifteen years, yeah.
Yeah. Oh, God bless!
Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
what I mean?
it's my first time.
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
No, I'm gonna quit!
Yeah?
It's terrific.
What?
Gimme a kiss.
Really?
And we'll digest our food better.
Okay?
Yeah.
Okay. Yeah.
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
H'm?
Yeah.
No.  You're a wreck.
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
No.
H'm?
big subject with me, yeah.
Yeah?
Those are the two categories...
M'hm.
M'hm.
Yeah.
You are extremely sexy.
Do I love you?
That's the key question.
Yeah.
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
I dunno.
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
I have a tiny apartment.
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? 
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
U-huh.
Let's just do it, all right?
Well, I need grass and so do you.
Yeah.
I didn't follow you!
You followed me!
Following is different. I was spying.
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
It's his name.
G-go on, I'm interested.
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
Yeah?
Will it change my life?
Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
I'm following you and David, if you-
I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
Oh.
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.
Yeah, where is the spider?
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Is he in the bathroom?
snow shovel or anything or something.
I think I left it there, I'm sorry.
Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick.
It's for my complexion.
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
What?
Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
Oh, darn it.
Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it.
What... huh?
What thing?
yes, we had, uh...
Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
Nothing at all?
Yeah.
I'm cool.
There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
Remember that day?
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
I thought just earplugs.
This is my room.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Can I confess something?
Step up here!
What'd I do?
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
Don't get upset!
Dammit! I was so close.
What-
My head is throbbing.
Oh, you got a headache!
I have a headache.
Bad?
Oswald and ghosts.
Jesus!
You catch Dylan?
Tsch, a few.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
Are you?
Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
I mean that as a compliment.
without getting... well, let's put it this way...
What are you depressed about?
Yes.
Tell him.
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
Oh, when'd you quit smoking?
Whatta you mean?
Mean?
Stop calling me Max.
Ah.
Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...
You'll total the whole car.
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
Max, I've got a hit series.
Yeah, I know; but you're adding fake laughs.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.
Oh, Jesus.
You all right?
I don't know, I mean, I-
You wanna lie down?
M'hm.
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
V.P.L.?
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
And... uh-
We're gonna operate together.
Keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don't get old.
His wife has diabetes!
Di-diabetes? Is that any excuse? Diabetes?
She was stealing.
But she's colored.
SO?
They're persecuted enough!
Who's persecuting? She stole!
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
Yes, I do.
You think so? Do you really?
We're going to take them to the airport.
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
Well, hi!
...of possibly working together.
It was a wonderful set.
Oh, gosh.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
And here, you just-
I was a great beauty.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
I was very charming.
There were many men interested in you?
Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
Did you know the contractor?
Very well.
Was it a contractor?
It's the way they do things.
To code?
You should talk to Mr. Joe.
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
Why didn't you come in?
Would it make a difference?
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
Had a little help?
Absolutely not.
It has your ring.
I'm not that good.
And how's the diva doing?
She's got great tits.
She's a constant surprise.
And you've only just met.
The movie.
Any thoughts on casting yet?
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
It's alright, isn't it?
Things always look much worse in the morning.
I don't know how to make her funny.
I...wait, what are you talking about?
What?
Why didn't you bring him?
He's allergic.
To dander.  Otis.
Oh.
Didn't I say?
Well, probably.
I'll change back before we leave.
Just don't fucking tell her.
It's not going to come up.
Don't you miss it?
Never.
Really.
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph.
Oh my God, the sitter.
I love her too, Joe.
Yeah.
He's not going tonight.
And you're not the wife.
It's not a contest.
Damn straight.
Count on it.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
Can I open it?
Sally?
When does he graduate high school?
You really need to be fucked.
I love you, Joe Therrian.
Let's go upstairs, okay?
Harry called.
And?
Lucy overdosed.
But she's alright.
She's in ICU.
She left a note.
Fuck you.
Leave us alone right now.
Monica.
We live next door.
Oh.  You're them.
Excuse me?
We've heard lots about you.
You have?
You have to sign your taxes anyway.
Nice to meet you.
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
Well it's fucking time.
Forget it, Judy.
Are you my big hard hero?
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
Oh yeah?
Let me heal you, baby.
Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus.
A perfect night.
Hm.  We should do it again.
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
Not as a rule.
They didn't sign their goddamn tax returns!
Hey!  Would you?
It was fifteen seconds.
I don't think so.
Are you always this much fun?
Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.
Give him a minute, Clair.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
Anytime, sport.
Yeah, thanks pal.
Fantastic.  Out here.
Well, you're a tower of support.
Whatever you say.  Listen, I love you.
He's directing now.
We'll be fine.
Did you invite them?
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
Did you tell Joe to behave?
Just do what I say, alright?
I'm ready.
Ryan's novel?
Accept a compliment.
Through the sweats or not?
No.  I missed that.
For good.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
I'll say as little as possible.
You can never be too early or too thin.
Who'd like to go and find Otis?
It's alright.  Be our guests.
Truce?
Truce.
Dinner.  Don't be angry.
I'm not fucking angry, for God's sake.
Well he can't have gone far.
There are fucking coyotes out there.
Or shitty!!  Otis!!
Otis!!!!
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
Otis!
Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her?
About me!
Hello?  Last birthday was?
Sally, for Christ's sake.
Anyone else?
This is insanity.  Sally...
Don't.
Don't push me away.
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
I wanted you back.
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
You're not ready.
I'll never forgive you.
You don't have to.
Okay.
That's under lock and key.
Me too.
It's a Calder.
I know.
He's my favorite.
Will you make love with me?
Oh, you know, I am.
Has she called?
Come on, Panes...
Sure.
I'll do it.
Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
Lovely.
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
Oh.  Well.  Good.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
Yes.
Don't be silly.
Joking.
It's Jerry's worst idea.
Ah there's our snookums now.
God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
I meant Sally.
I meant Sally.
Oh.  You're serious.
Sally did all this herself?
Oh.
No you're not.
And Ryan works at home.
I'll be your best friend.
I will treasure this.
Sally!!!!
Lemon.
Lemon it is.
I think he's really angry with me too.
That's a lot of those.
Medallions.
A lot of cakes.
Yes.
And he doesn't smoke?
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
You must have been a baby.
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
Come here.
I like you.
I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know.
I'm so sorry.
This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are.
Clair is a hovering mother.
Trust him.
Time!
Well...wow...
Not good.
I'm sure you understand.
He always has two or three going...
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
They're nothing like us.
Don't go in, Ryan.
What?
Let's just go home, okay?
Yes.  And you've met Joe.
Oh?
Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
Well, whoever did this is amazing.
I did it.
I'm so sorry.
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
How long ago was it?
Yes.
Do you need anything else?
No, no thanks.
Oh?
The charades.
Thank you.
That was my clue.
Oh?
The Shostakovich.
Really??
Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
Would you, like, marry him?
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Are you asking me to marry you?
Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.
It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
Not enough.
Oh great.
Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with me.
She's all over him, are you blind?
It could be worse.
How?
You see, that's worse.
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
I wasn't finished.
Okay.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
We're just feeling our way back.
"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
You know it's true.
What does that mean?
About five thousand dollars.  With my discount.
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
I'm worried about your Galiano.
You're a shit.
No, really, five thousand with your discount.
That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
I don't want to talk about it.
No.  Not something new.
Well, something's wrong.
Thanks.
That's not an answer, is it?
Yes, you're a monster.
You don't need to thank me.
We're going to have to go back out there.
It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.
Rose.
Absolutely.  You always wonder where your books end up.  Why don't we use it?
I'll be right out.
I don't mind...
Ah.
Like Joe.
Hmm.  Where are my kids?
Nevermind.
Yes.
She's such a great photographer.
Hm.
I thought it was okay where it was.
It's much more personal in here.
A notch above the storage room.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
Oh Soph...
Well good.  Thank God.
I don't have a drug problem.
Neither does Joe.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!
No -- an <u>individual</u>!
Right...because every ant's important!
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
You -- you think I'm right?
Let me think.  Hmmnn...  Never.  Bye!
I'm Princess Bala.
Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
Divinely?
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
How should <u>I know</u>?
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
Well I guess that makes us even.
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
I <u>didn't</u> choose him.  What kind  of <u>idiot</u> would...  ...<u>choose</u> who she wanted to marry?
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
That's not a name!  That's just a letter!
Wait, I hear something!
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
Well...no, but --
So what makes you so special?
Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
<u>This is all your fault</u>!!!
You held onto this all that time?
There's something going on, Z --
There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where I want to go!
Of course --
Of course not --
Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
Mom!
Trial membership?  Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch.
Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!
Don't get all sappy about it!
Barbatus?
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Duty calls!
I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
No one should have to.  Have him brought to me.
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Good.  You're a good soldier.
I...I have no idea, sir.
Okay, son.
Not that one.  Or that one.
No, sir!
Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
Oh, of course --
Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
They should be...  But there's something funny about that soldier.
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
Why are we so successful?
I'm glad you asked me that question!
I'll be back.
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
Well, you just sit here and be a party-pooper.
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
You're a real buddy.
Yeah, I know.
What do I do?
That's sweet.  That's real sweet.
Yeah.  How much?
I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
Don't worry about the old lady. One squawk from her, and she's out of a job.
Under the mat? 
That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
Something the matter?
Care to make a small wager?
I've been here twice as long as you have --
It's a bet.
Morning, Miss Kubelik.
Yeah.  I better not get too close.
Oh, I never catch colds.
I should have stayed in bed last night.
Good night.
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
Would you like to?
Yeah.
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
No. Like a man.
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
What gave you that idea?
I forgive you.
You shouldn't.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
You're so right.
I thought so.
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
No -- I like it.
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
The mirror -- it's broken.
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
I just want to go brush my teeth --
No -- I don't want anything.
I'll fix you some coffee.
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
And where are you now?
In his apartment.
His apartment?
I mean -- her apartment.
What's your friend's name?
Baxter.
What's her first name?
Miss. 
As soon as I can walk.
Something wrong with your legs?
No -- it's my stomach.
Your stomach?
They had to pump it out.
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
I am. Let me get the cards.
You don't have to entertain me.
Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
Pick a card.
Was he really upset when you told him?
Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.
You really think so?
No doubt about it.
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
Miss Kubelik, I don't think that's such a good idea.
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Do I have to?
You bet. I got a terrific hand.
Gin.
Would you mind opening the window?
I just want some fresh air.
I would.
For me?
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
In this house, you're supposed to.
Well, things are a little disorganized around here.
I guess so.
I know so. He's a taker.
A what?
Here.
In the knee?
Of course not. Here's the fruit cake.  And you want to see my knee? 
No -- just come as you are.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.
What?
Fine. How's your eye?
Fine.
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
Good night, Miss Kubelik.
I'm fine.
Are you sure? How's your knee?
I'm fine all over.
Mind if I come in?
Of course not.
Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter -- this is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.  Come on, Oscar.
Yes, sir.
Think.
That's right, Baxter.
Yes, sir.
How would you like to go tonight?
Relax, Baxter.
Thank you, sir.
You know how people talk.
Oh, you don't have to worry --
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
Don't thank me -- thank your friends here -- they're the ones who recommended you.
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
So it was.  She threw it at me.
Put me down for Thursday again.
Roger. And I'll get that other key.
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
What do you mean, sorry?
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
How's that again?
No key!
So what's it going to be?
Yes?
Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
Look, Buddy-boy -- if there wasn't a lady present, I'd clobber you.
What does he mean, accident?
You?
Who else?
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
Well -- it's all right with me, Bud. Let me check. I'll get back to you.
What do you want?
What do I -- ?  Just a minute.
Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
Sure.
Kubelik -- with two k's.
What's her address?  Where does she live?
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
Not you -- Miss Kubelik.
Well, I have things to do --
What's this -- you packing?
Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
Family?
No.
I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.
You got a girl-friend?
Good night.
Good night?
The party's over.
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
My shoes.
Kubelik.
Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy done for us lately?
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Get more coffee.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
And what happened to you?
I took sleeping pills.
Do you know where you are, Fran?
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
I don't know.
This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Let me take that.
Six weeks. But who's counting?
I missed you, Fran.
It's been hell.
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
We talked about a lot of things.
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
I wasn't trying.
What do you think?
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
Are you sure that's what you want?
Fran --
I love you -- remember?
Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
You'll miss your train, Jeff.
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
It won't always be like this.  I love you, Fran.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
What's the difference?  Some schnook that works in the office.
I told you -- with my mother.
Where does she live?
A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Certainly not.  I'm a happily married man.
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
Lovely. You were a big help.
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
It won't happen again.
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
Oh -- oh!
Where are you headed?
What's it matter? Get to the point.
Look -- you know the girls -- Thta's Terri -- she was playmate of --
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
I said I like all of them.
We have a lot of pride in our unit --
No -- absolutely not --
One for all -- all for one --
You can keep your fucking fuel --
Men of all races -- nationalities --
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
Moonby what?
Sure, thanks.
Part.
Which part is that ?
My part.  Beer, with ice and water.
No.
North ?
Yeah. Way north.
What unit were you with ?
None.
Rangers, eh?
Sort of.
No -- I worked too far north for LRRP.
Let's talk about you.
I was an FO for the 25th.
Yeah.
Fat. That's real fat.
How long were you up there ?
A long time.
A year ? Waiter another beer.
Yes, sir --
Why they call you that?
Call me what, sir?
No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
Cook school -- that did it.
How?
I don't know.
Whatdoya think it thinks.
That we're dumber than we look.
Yeah, it is.
Looks that way.
Who's he?
God knows.
Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
Where ?
First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River.
The draft of that river might be too shallow on the point.
I'll go with him --
All right I got a little surprise for you --
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
No shit -- hot damn --
We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
Get in there now or I'll bury you in this river.
In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light.
We're Americans.
When'd you do it?
While you were sleeping.
Thta's not Charlie's work --
Yeah -- like keep out --
What is it?
Listen.
Who knows? Right.
Too far inland.
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
I saw that Colonel's Huey on the point --
I wonder if that was the same copter.
Would he remember you ?
Maybe.
Anyone got a cigarette.
Ours.
Touchy.
Terminate with extreme prejudice.
Yeah, it still runs.
Charlie?
Charlie?
They must have seen the fire.
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
Yeah.
This gentleman or myself ?
No, sir.
A lame ?
Maybe.
Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
Do you know that jungle?
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
That's right, sir.
I haven't surfed since I got here.
What, sir?
I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.
Sure -- fine --
What?
Yeah -- yeah, I can understand how you feel.
What do you mean?
Six to eight feet.
Wh -- what?
You want'a surf, soldier?
Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
What's the furthest you been in?
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
No. Walked.
What'd you do for supplies?
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
Can you trust them?
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
Don't you agree?
What about this point here?
Who?
The enemy. Who else?
It'll get here, soldier.
The kid can't ride sloppy waves.
We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
You were not coming here, to see me?
Yes.
Yeah, I like it...
I love it.
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
How's yours?
I can handle it.
No water.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
What are you doing?
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
I had immense plans.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I was on threshold of great things.
I'm taking you back.
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
Were you with him, when...
What?
Yeah... thanks.
Which one's the Colonel's?
Yeah, Jesus Christ !
Any time -- us -- Americans.
I wasn't looking.. I was running.
No -- leave it --
That's me.
We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
And shut up.
His name is...
We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
The war will still be here tomorrow.
Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
What did you hear?
But Captain, I mean -- cannibals.
The river is beautiful.
Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
Well who the hell verifies that ?
I do.
No sir, I think -- this'll be a little bit different --
Anyone got a card?
Son of a bitch, sir.
Beverly Hills --
What?
Needs patching.
Wait 'til I'm across!
43   CONTINUED:
Your infrared camera?
Keep back.
28   CONTINUED:
She's dead.
Oh.
I don't want to talk any more.
The radio's on the fritz.
Somewhere along the pipeline.
Be careful -- there're two of them.
Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
That's not what I meant.
It's exactly what you meant.
Not me.  I'm equipped.
Wait a second.
That's my line.
I'll tell you everything later.
Where's Corbett?
Relax.  I just want to ask them how the hunting is.
I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
Leave my traps.  We'll tag up, couple days.
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?
New to the country, kid?
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
-- To take you to jail?  It'll be my pleasure.
A daughter in Oregon.
That's right.  You're not.
Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
Forget it.  It would take days.
I'm still figuring: You're either real brave or real dumb.
You know Meyerling?
I'm here to do my job.
Too bad we're heading west.
How many do you see?
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
You don't feel cold?
It's a spring day...
Where's my ELT?
It was blown up with the plane.
Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
Hate to disappoint you.
I already have.
You don't know how true that is.
You broke the radio, remember?
I'm sure she's fine.  Seemed like a clever kid.

I'm living proof of that sad fact.
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
No, I better stay at my post.
But I would.
Don't try me.  I'll kill you if it comes to it.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
What does this matter to you?
-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.
Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
Any idea who could've done it?
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
Ease off.  We do this my way.
Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
They'll have to come right past us.
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
I want us to go out.
I love you.
Don't be silly. How bad?
Not bad.
No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
Stay out of this...  Doctor?
Uh-huh.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
Will you please take it?
I've got Jews at my table.
What do you care?
Spencer.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
Oh, please...
How do you know about my mother?
I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!
How ya doing?
Carol the waitress?
Yes.
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Just how grateful I am.
What you did changed my life.
Thank you.
Two days.
I can't. I work.
You take off when you have to.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
What's that got to do with it?
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
Is there another way to see it?
Are you still coming?
Yes.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.
Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
Welcome.
You like sad stories -- you want mine.
One baked -- one fries.
Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
Here's the trouble with never.
It's one idea...
It was a mistake.
This one has a special meaning.
I'll take you... why not?
Yeah... Well...
How you doing?
I can trust my brain.
That seems like a good choice.
Go ahead.
I should've danced with you.
Okay. Good-bye.
So long.
Were you asleep?
Were you asleep?
What are you doing here?
What a break...
I had to see you...
You know what? I...
Well...
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
I'm sorry... are you okay?
How to die, mostly.
Good night.
Stop staring. Do a vase.
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
I'll take care of myself --
You think you're kidding.
Don't want to. I love you.
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
So am I, Frank.
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
Thanks for looking after him.
He's a pain in the ass.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
Hey -- you called me... I...
About a dog.
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
Hi. You have hard shells, right?
Wait here.
You little stinker. He's given you everything.
Oh, is he dead?
Ask him.
How're you doing?
Maybe this can wait.
Well, that's a load off.
Do you realize that I work at him?
Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
Thank you for walking him.
It smells like shit in here?
Go away.
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Where are all your queer party friends?
Rot in hell, Melvin.
Oh, my gosh.
Now we'll both call him.
Come on, sweetheart...
Yo, yo, yo...
Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
Thanks.
Never a break. Never.
Does it matter?
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
I love you.
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
But you know where you're lucky?
Absolutely not.
I forgot to lock the door.
I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Where?
What?
What restaurant?
Uh, Fontella's
So you're from around here?
No.  No I'm not.
Not too good at small talk, eh?
I know just what you mean.  I'm pretty beat myself.
What?
What?  You think I'm running you up?
Just do your job.
No fucking way.
Okay, don't.
Holy shit!  Robert Rath wants to know my name.
How long have you been freelance?
Two years.  Two long fucking years.
We go around once.
Bullshit.
What?  What's okay?
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
All right, Bain.  Pay attention, because this is where everything changes.
That's right.
Bain!
You're too late.
I don't give a fuck what you are.  I asked you --
Do you want Rath or not?
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
Sick.  The flu.
I'm worried about you, Robert.
The contract was stolen.
Know what?
Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
The contract?
Paid in full.
I bet you fucking know!
It cost us.
Robert?  Robert?
One hour per man.
Where are we going?
What?  How did you know I had a cat?
Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
Yeah?
Yeah.
I'm part of the game, just like you.
The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.
Turn off the engine.
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
You didn't know anything about me.
An assassin?
What does that mean?
Another contractor.
Someone hired both of you?
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
He wants to kill you?
Yes.
Why?
And you want to use me to get him?
Forget it!
We don't have a choice.
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
Rath.  Robert Rath.
Electra.
Just Electra?
Yeah.
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
No.  Just Electra.
Why?
Because I'm done.
It's not the same, is it?
He was killed.
Why?
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
More or less.
You were like a boy genius?
I was just different.
You went from high school to the Agency?
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
Why not?
Why did you leave the Agency?
My first take?
Yes.
Why?
Because I want to know.
After that?
They become complicated... messy.
Did it ever bother you?
Did it ever bother James Bond?
That's fiction.
I don't.
Good.
Where is it?
Mexico.
Thinking.
About?
Nothing.
You were there?
What?
Work.  The things I need to get done.
Not even a stalemate?
No.
You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
Here?
In Costa Blanca.
Yes.
I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
Really?
Sorry.
How was the beach?
The beach?  It was nice.
Taiwan.
Transmits and receives.
Cheap as shit.
It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
Then, we wait.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
What?
I told you, he will.
Yes.
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
Yes.
What happened?
Yes.  Here I am again.
No.
Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
They're worth less points.
So?
I didn't notice them.
How do you know they're not?
I went into their room this afternoon.
Nobody ever sees me.
No?
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
What?
That's a ridiculous move.
Why?
Because, I'll take it.
I'm sure you will.
Am I attractive?
Are you attracted to me?
Yes.
Why?
Why?  I don't know.
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
Attraction is a complication?
It can be.
It happened to you before?
Yes.
Who was she?
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
She was taken.
Did you --
I'm not sure that I care anymore.
When did it start?
Honestly?
Uh-huh.
That doesn't sound normal.
I'm not normal.
Martin.
What?
I waited another four minutes.
I'm taking off my mike.
Okay.
Electra --
What?
Last night --
Yes.
Oh, God.  I see it!
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
Yes.  Please come in.
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
I called because I just want... I need to talk.
Honesty.
Can you tell me about it?
Do you believe that?
Yes.
Anytime.
You're pretty famous aren't you?
Shit... oh well.
That's exactly what I told myself.
Go ahead.
What do other guys do?
Why didn't you fade?
You mean quit?
Yeah.
How would you like the funds?
American currency.
This will take some time.
I have all day.
Thank you.
And pay for their drinks occasionally.
A coke, if they have it?
Hey Doug, you want a beer?
I don't know, maybe I'll enrol for postgrad' studies next Autumn.
What's that? A Democrat with an attitude!
Yeah, group bloody therapy time.
Wanker more like, what does he know about writing.
We're only joking.....It is your round though!
Fifteen crowns.
An alternative literary venue!
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
We could make a run for it?
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
That makes you an expert I guess.
Sure....As for the crap, I've got an idea.
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
Tell them we're working for the University.
Thought of everything haven't you.
'cause you stink of booze.
No....The Asylum!
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
I've been saying that since we met.
No, it's welded up!....Let's take a look from the inside.
But how did the wall get here?
Don't we have enough already?
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
Yeah, I'll take some.
Have you ever stolen anything?
Nope.
Close!
They'll never get us.
We're going to need it all.
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.
We don't speak Czech!
Am I late?
Who put a bee up your butt?
When your ready Son!
Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
Both, see you later.
No, not yet.
You're all bloody useless.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
No, We aren't going to do it.
I fell in love.
And a tram hit you?
No, the boyfriend.
What happened to Katka?
You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?
A fine specimen for conversion.
What are you on about?
Nothing, it's just that's when things usually start to go wrong.
You capitalist pig!
Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
Tell me some bad news?
I don't want to ruin your day.
So I hear.
Huh?
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
Now you're using that word.
I could try and get a Western lawyer.
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
Good, what's his number?
Some deal you did there!
Here!
What are you talking about?
Sure I'm sure!
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
Yeah, pretty well.
Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
That one?
Yeah!
Follow that Budjovice sign.
Turn around quick!
You mean your NOT going to spring me?
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
That's my mum's.
Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative.
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
I've been around.
Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
Here's the details.
Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
We should be done by the weekend.
I'll take a rain-check for now.
Yeah, maybe.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
I think he's jealous of Havel.
I don't care. I'm not staying out late Doug.
Don't worry it's okay!
We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
So, we won't be going to London?
No, not just yet.
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
Let's have a look anyway.
Yeah, you're right.... I've got an idea!
Fernet and tonic.
Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
I hope so!
There's nothing there for me.
Not this time, Kat.
Sure, I've done it easily.
Hey Chris, keep an eye on things.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
It's not so much.
Yep, it's all yours.
Okay.
About forty minutes.
Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.
Yo, dobree!
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
Good, great....Dobchay!
Two hundred dollars, make it six thousand crowns?
What for?
Insurance!
No, it should be over soon.
You mean it's started?
We don't need you.
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
A champion of lost causes huh?
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
We_re not all running away
I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
Yeah seems okay.
No, just a coffee.
One beer, one coffee, thanks.
I'll be okay, just get me home.
I had it coming from someone.
Are you sure I shouldn't get a doctor.
Sometimes.
Run into Josh?
Yeah, but it was okay.
How did he look?
Hmm, I still owe him.
Why don't we both forget about him?
It's Josh's.
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
And you broke into that room?
That's right.
You will wish you hadn't.
It was the biggest I could find.
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
A kind of freedom.
The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
You may use my office.
Release Mr Greenwell's possessions.
Working....Under cover.
A drill, what are you up to?
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
Come on, that shit can wait.
No way, he even gave me back pay.
See you brought one of the patients with you too.
Well come on, sit down.
It's time to go home, Holly.
Leave me, just leave me alone Josh.
Go to hell!
It's more than what you're worth.
You bastard!
Don't you dare, I'll be back!
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
Can we talk in your office?
Yes, if you can get him free.
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
We're not sure...
Some Americans?
What if his accomplices have made copies?
With you.
I. Don't. Dance.
Heart be still.
I'll tell her you were here.
I'm sorry about how we --
I do.
Kelly wouldn't do that.
Why not?
Cuz nothing happened at school.
About a job.
I don't want his money.
It could help with a new car --
-- I like the car I have.
That's over. Way over.
You're fine like that, Mom.
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
No. I won't be long.
Late night.  You?
Were you with Jamie?
You do. You're handsome and charming.
I didn't know either.
He wants to talk to you.
Now it's okay?
I need to whizz.
I'm just wondering --
You do --
York Ave.
Demented.
She's not. She's got her own ideas.
Scamming's a strong word.
Later.
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
Me.
-- This your idea of small talk?
I don't make small talk --
-- Obviously.
You don't know me.
Can't you have a normal conversation?
'They won't.'
'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.
Why?
No. Not like you.
So you agree you need help?
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
Kinda. Yeah.
Go for it.
You want to tell me...
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
Know so.
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
Do you think I'm strange?
Could be...
That is my telescope.
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Or building blocks for a world that never formed.
Looking for something -- someone.
I hope so.  I think maybe she sees me now.
In ten words or less?
Yeah.
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
You don't believe in anything?
Your father doesn't like me.
Sometimes I don't even trust me.
I'm really glad you think so.
Yeah --
Belinda's a very jealous person.
That would be the reason.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
Then maybe you can read mine.
Healthy as can be.
Thank you. So were you.
You're hardly nice to anyone.
And that would ruin your reputation how?
That sounds like horseshit.
It's not.
Prove it.
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
You don't know what you want --
When I have something to say.
It means you can do anything.
No.  But are you -- impressed?
What?
You.
I wanted this to be a date.
I have to get you home by one.
No.
I know you want to.
We're doing something -- ?
Fun.
Where?
I'm sure. Pretty sure.
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
What do you actually know with religion?
Wonder. Beauty. Joy.  Love.
Maybe you're not supposed to.
Loved?
That. And less strange.
Twice a year.
Where?
Look. Talk. Not talk.
I was twelve.
Mars doesn't rise until 2:30
Hoped for it.
No. Why? Are you seducible?
What about your father?
Sure.
I don't care.
Yes, one of many.
I'm not applying to college.
What are you going to -- ?
Pull over.
Where? Why?
I'm sick.
I should have told you sooner --
No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
I will.
Anything you want.
Nothing.
I used to like yogurt.
That I want you to take me home.
That's what I mean.
I was going to fake it.
Tired.
Better. I was really angry.
You'll be fine for a few minutes.
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
But if you could, you would?
He wants help with his lines --
I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
Up to?
Boys like him have -- expectations.
I have expectations, too.
Dad --
This -- him -- Landon -- is what's best for me!
Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
By making me ill, he is punishing me!  I just don't know what for.
Lead man.
Does it have to do with Jamie?
I don't want to see her hurt.
Ever again.
Like what, sir?
You decide.
Your parents are divorced?
How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
Either. Both.
If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!
I'm not tired.
I need to be with her.
For the focuser?
I helped Jamie with the first one.
I thought she built it herself.
She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
Yes. You?
Getting by.
Yes.
She did. It was you.
That's right. You just act like one.
That's right.  The world is your oyster.
I want to come back.
How would you do that, Mr. Carter?
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
You don't. That's the point.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
I didn't say you did.
You came here to give me my report card?
You're welcome.
Are you?
A similar triangle?
Okay. Make me an isosceles.
What do you want, Biff?
Where's your old man?
Yes, sir!
This is 1952....?
Uh, yes, sir...
Marty. What's for breakfast?
Gimme some chili, fries, and a Tab.
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
Third time they've been out there this week.
I don't know. National Cash Register?
Learn anything?
Oh yeah.
That's good.
Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
Uh, thanks...
Poly-what?
Have we ever met before?
Uh, hi....
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
But he didn't ask me.
But he does! Don't you see?
Coming, Eileen...
How are you?
What drill?
Learn anything?
Oh yeah.
Good.
Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
Okay, then!
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
Bic... It's a Bic pen.
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
Look, Marty, I'm just not a fighter...
And where am I gonna be?
No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
Not a holocaust --
Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
Marty. Marty Lewis.
Five cents, please.
Operator, what's today's date?
March 11th.
What year?
Nineteen fifty --
Pro! Release the rope!
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
AM or PM?
Pro, the sun's out!
Oh, right, right... 
...To be traveled through
Then where the hell is he?
Is Shemp all right?
So what? We'd be rich!
You know me?
Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
You were ringing the doorbell!
Professor, be serious, would you?
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
Well, it was there.
Curious... Very curious....
You did what?!?
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
Perfect...
The Orpheum.
What? 
A Tab.
What happened to Dick Wilson?
Yeah... Jesus! I wonder how he ever got up enough nerve to marry my mom.
Hi, Marty!
What did you do to yours?
Well, he's gone.
Gone?... Where?
He said not to tell.
Oh yeah?
Can't afford to take chances.
You don't mind?
What do you mean?
Not bad.
They come with the house.
She plays the clarinet, too.
No, he showed me one.
I'll catch up with you.
Okay.
What do you feed him?
He never bit me.
I used to throw trash for the City.
You lost that one?
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
You like people?
They're okay.
Then why'd you do it?
Tom...
Thanks.
I mean it.
What'd you come out here for?
Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
No, you're not either.
Yeah? Why not?
Cause I can't allow it.
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
What's your friend's name?
Jack.
You love him?
I don't know.
Well, I've felt that way, hadn't you?
Nah, I got me a job.
Doing what?
Can I be honest?
Sure.
Yeah.
There you go.
Well, stop the world.
Quit my job.
Great.
Well, I got homework.
Bring it along.
I know.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Why not?
Just don't... I've got a headache.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
I don't care.
Don't ask me.
What?
Well, that's the point, stupid.
How bad off is he?
I can look and see.
You don't believe me, see for yourself.
You said that once already... Too late now.
Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
Yeah, me too.
How's he doing?
I got him in the stomach.
I don't know.
Just to keep him out of the sun.
Well, we'll see about that... Hey, lookie.
Positive?
Yes.
Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.
I'm serious.
It was going too fast.
Yeah.
I just don't want to go.
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
Yes?
Yes.
Just thinking.
Yes.
Okay, no monkey business then.
Just a second now. That's your truck. isn't it?
It's mine all right.
Just gimme a chance.
Hold it right there.
Beats me.
Wanta sue me?
No.
Who're you?
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
Not me. No way.
They're stealing my chopper!
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
Planet 10?
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
Same one you had yesterday?
Vanished. Thin air.
The deuce you say.  That crate!
Just 'grazed' you, huh?
Arachtoid.
Not really.  This is pretty important.
She wants a picture.
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
Let her out. In my custody.
Let her out?  She's a killer.
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
What is it, Tommy?
Where's the professor?
Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.
The door's locked.
At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!
Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.
Now!
What? How do you know that?
To get my guns.
Don't shoot!
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
This is so embarrassing...
Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
Everybody okay up here?
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
You.  Like the papers all say.
Pretty terrible shot.
Who?
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
It's kinda hard this way.
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
Any time.
Oh, my.
You don't wanna know.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
Go where?  Where're you going?
Absolutely.
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
Penny--?!  Are you all right?
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?
I have a radio fix...
John Whorfin will kill us!
You look!  It's not here!
Damn John Whorfin--!
What's happening with my call to SAC?
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.
I didn't drop 'em.
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
Pictures don't lie.
Where do you hail from, Doc?
Cause Buckaroo needs me here.
No!  Ditto the professor-
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
How about you? Will you be alright?
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
Yes I am. I'm working on a wres  please call me Barton.
...I know this must look... funny.
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
What. What don't I understand?
Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink.
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
What are they like? What are they about?
You wrote his scripts for him?
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
Before Bill came to Hollywood.
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
I want to know!
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
I'll bet. Jesus  "The grand productive days." What a goddamn phony.
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
Drown all those rascals...
...Who is this?
Chet!
Chet! From downstairs!
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
What DID you mean?
A week, eight, nine days 
...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.
I...
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
Nothing, really. Said he was in the insurance business.
What else?
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
Just Bill, please.
It's still a little early for me.
So be it.
...Huh? No, I'm 
I'm a writer. Ted O 
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
He's a great writer 
A souse!
What do you do far a living?
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
...Barton, is everything okay?
Yes... Isn't it?
Well, you just... sound a little
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work 
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
Damned difficult, I'd imagine.
What kind of scribbler are you  newspaperman did you say?
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now 
Hell, I could tell you some stories
Frequently played, seldom remarked.
Charlie. How are you.
No, I guess you're stuck with the one you've got. Have a seat.
Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
Ready... wrestle!
Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
So they say.
Course not, compadre. You'll see me again.
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
Are you sure 
No... no...
No... Can I come in?
Why don't we go to your room-
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
Charlie, I'm in trouble  something horrible's happened  I've gotta call the police...
Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
I've gotta call the police  or you could call for me 
You gotta believe me 
Hold on 
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
We gotta call the police 
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
What do you think happened?
I believe you  I KNOW you. But why should the police?
She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
Charlie! I've got no one else here! You're the only person I know in Los Angeles...
Because you DON'T LISTEN!
I'm at the Earle.
Lou.
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
I apologize, Barton.
Colonel Lipnik, if you don't mind.
Transient or resident?
Huh?
What 
The others are being sent.
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
You're a sick fuck, Fink.
What do you do, Fink?
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
Also known as Madman Mundt.
He's a little funny in the head.
All of which he's now missin'.
Well, some of his throat was there.
Physician, heal thyself.
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
No reputable company would hire a guy like that.
Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't it?
I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
Give you nose bleeds?
You two have some sick sex thing?
How's about it, Bart?
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
Home. Watching TV.
All night?
Yeah.
Were you drinking?
When did you start drinking again?
A couple days ago.
Did you find out about her parents?
Bring 1976 up.
Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine.
How about the coke?
No?
Thank you.
You don't look so okay.
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
What else is new?
Who?
Catherine Tramell.
Why didn't you tell me?
I thought you quit.
Who's got access to my goddamn file?
No, Nick, please --
Who?
Nilsen.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
Yes you did.  I'm a big girl.  I can handle it.
I know the type.  I'm a psychologist.
Tell me about Catherine.
What did she tell me, Beth?
I had him in two classes.
You saw all the reports, Beth!
She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
Put your hands up!
I know who you are.
I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him.
About a year and a half.
Only when they make interesting reading.
I don't smoke.
Yes, you do.
I quit.
It won't last.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman.
I have nothing to hide.
I loved him.  I hurt.
No.
Because you didn't love him --
That's right.
Thanks.
You see?  We're both innocent, Nick.
You know all about me.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
No.  Come in.
I'd like to ask you some, too.
I don't know.  But you do.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
They were drug buys.  I was a vice cop.
There's a name from the past.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
Didn't you study it in school?
Do you?
Why not?
Not me.
Please.
Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
What if I call you Nicky?
My wife used to call me that.
I know, Nicky, but I like it.
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
It's not the same thing, is it?
What do you want from me, Catherine?
What's it about?
To see if he can get away with it.
I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
She's seen everything before.
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
Do you want her to join us sometime?
Fine.  How's your back?
It hurts.
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
I told you I had a vivid imagination.
I don't have a choice.
Do you think I told her to kill You?
Make love to me.
I never have before.
No?
I'll convince you.
Did you?  What's she doing?
Liar.
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
No.
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
What are you researching?
I'm writing a book.
Really.  What are you writing about.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
What happens to them?
Why not?
Somebody has to die.
Why?
Somebody always does.
How did it end?
I told you.  She kills him.
The games are over.  You were right. It was the fuck of the century, Shooter.
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
Did you ever tie him up?
He was murdered.
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown.
Why would I need an attorney?
Yes I am.
How's that?
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
Cocaine.
.38 revolver.  Never recovered.
Was his wife ever a suspect?
Nope, can't say that I do.
That's him.
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
What kind of talk?
The usual -- a girlfriend.
He had a girlfriend?
You did.
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
I never heard of him.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
I'm a smart sonofabitch.  I just hide it.
She misses me.
You sure got real conclusive ways of demonstrating that.
I don't know.
Somethin', though.
Everybody that she plays with dies.
I went over last night, too.
I wasn't there last night, either.
I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber.
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
Say what?
I feel fine!
I don't know.  I'm just not.
She's right.  You got an icepick in you yet?
Why not?
You're my friend, Gus.
If she's telling  you the truth.
I'm going with you.
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
Yeah.  I know.
You're looking for Catherine, not me.
Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
We bring her in for questioning.
I'm sure.
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
On what basis?
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
Did you check all four years?
Yes I did.
Can you check again?
Can there be some mistake?
Only if you're making it.
I'm a painter, too.
Really. Huh. Too bad.
Rene's been telling me about your work.
I don't know.
When's your show?
Not sure. How was yours?
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
Let's get out of here.
The whole thing  painting.
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
Saddle River, New York!
It's in New Jersey.
I think it's in New Jersey.
It's in New York.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Yeah... Like  stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
Ten bucks apiece.
That's good. At least they're interested.
What's wrong?
Do you still love her?
Well, have you asked her to come back?
You think those are good presents? Who wants an old wig?
I don't like beer.
We can do better. It needed more white.
Annina Nosei.
Who?
No.
Aren't they?
How much for these five?
You should talk to him about this.
I really think you should talk to him about this.
You haven't been by lately.
How about right now?
I know.
Hi Dad. Hi Nora.
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
Cut it out, man! And don't be callin' me that shit!
I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment.
How do you know?
I know that. Don't let him get away.
What do you mean?
I need a dealer.
They're just words.
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
Yes, but as a black painter 
I use a lot of colors  not only black.
I'm not black.
You're not?
Not what?
Not black.
No, I'm Haitian-Puerto Rican.
We don't hang them at home, y'know  just in the streets..
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
Yeah.
Out?
Still not here.
 In this corner?
Yeah..
Use your fucking instinct.
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve  I mean Shenge.
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
What's wrong with you today?
Willie Mays.
SAMO.
Oh yeah..
About what?
Your people.
Oh  you mean black people!
Come on in!
For real?
Yeah... I'll paint on it.
Good.
What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
Good. What do you have?
Come on, let's get out of here.
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
Guess I just got sick of him.
I think I could do that alone.
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
Party girls? Can I call you?
Yeah, if you have any dimes left. 477- 0496.
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
What who's saying?
Basquiat, what did you take?
You want some?
Well thanks!
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee 
Staten Island would be ok.
Think so?
You mean babies with you?
What's wrong with me?
You're your own baby.
Hi.
What's that?
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
Pretty much the same.
Forget it.
You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
Yeah, it's the best one.
I'll take the whole tin.
It's three thousand dollars!
Me? Why?
Sure. I'd be glad to.
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job?
Hi.
Some of them.
Stand still.
Thanks
I'd like to squeeze your titties.
Wanna Mac?
Have a Mac.
I don't eat junk food.
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it  did your girlfriend leave you?
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
My point exactly.
So shut up and keep painting..
What time is it?
5:11.
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
I can't. After the show.
Forget it.
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
Yeah.
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
I need this?
I need this?
It's vichyssoise, sir.
Vichyssoise.  Supposed to be cold, right?
No, actually I feel worse.
Alright, thanks.
Right.  Sure.  And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."
"Shreck's."  You --
I'm -- sorry, I --
Good joke.  Wanna hear another one?
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
What're you really after?
Have we?
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
Yes and no ...
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
I'm tempted.
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
"We"?  You and...
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
And the truth frightened her?
Photojournalist.
Nor I, on the second.
What're you doing three dates from now?
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
Weird, huh?
Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
Yawn.
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
Either you've caught a cold, or you're planning to kill me.
Was.
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
Huh?  You're implying I'm some kinda psycho criminal?
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
Dad!  Save yourself!
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
PMS.
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
... eight, seven...
Silent night, violent night...
All is shrill, all is blight...
No, just give you a splitting headache.
Well it's not working.
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
Oswald:  We need one more thing.
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
And a very, very good one.
Too good?
I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.
Eventually she married a young physician.
Oh no, those things frighten me.
As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child.
Too late for what, dear child?
In spirit only, I'm afraid.
The boys need help.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
No apology necessary.  That's the first time in thirty years.
There's a lovely inn just down --
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
What seems to be the problem?
That, sir, does not compute.
Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
Oxbridge Academy?
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
I'm afraid to ask.
Be ready for anything.
What exactly are you doing?
I don't know.  It just feels right.
Freeze, you're mad.  This capsule will slaughter thousands.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
It's the gear.  Chicks love the gear.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
How about, nice to see you?  Glad you're here to save my life.
Surf's up.
He'll be here.
I can make it.
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
Umm-hmmmm.
Definitely.
Open Sesame...Chicken.
Just the beast.
She knows who we are.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
Maybe he melted.
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.
People come first, Dr. Isley.
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
What?
Well...um...her.
Presumed dead.  No one knows.
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
You left your back wide open.  Freeze could have killed you.
Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?
But he's never said a word-
I'm scared, Dick.  Maybe for the first time in my life.  I'm really scared.
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
Dick, don't push me right now.
She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
She wants to kill you.
Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
Where is my wife?
I'm hungry.  I think I'll have poultry.
I find that unlikely.
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
At you?  Polly want a kiss?
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
One kiss, my love.  For luck.
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
I think they're getting worse.
It's a wonder you sleep at all.
Hardly a worry, sir.
She has an excellent mind.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
No. You said I. I killed them.
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
He ran away?
Actually, he took the car.
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
The _Rolls_?
_No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_!
Which `they' might that be, sir?
Why, indeed?
There's one other thing. I feel..
...Afraid.
What?
...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
What do maniacs always want?
Recognition, of course.
How about, MR. E.
Mystery.
And another name for Mystery?
Enigma.
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
Al?
Just checking, young sir.
Four seconds from...
What's wrong?
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
My life's an open book. You read?
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!
We'll talk some other -
Slanta.
Rinka.
Banzai.
Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.
Just ones this beautiful.
Wacko? That a technical term?
Not much.
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
And into a black dress.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
What? This isn't normal?
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep.
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
Well, I met someone...
Fast work. You just moved here.
What?
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
What do you want me to say? That I'm not attracted to him?
What?
Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
Stop fighting.
You do know. Try.
What?
Chase. There's something I need to tell you--
Excuse me.
Who is it?
How could I forget?
Can't tell if you don't say please.
Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?
What the hell is going on here?
I don't think so.
...You gonna kill me?
What say we flip for it?
The coin _wants_ to decide.
Here. Get a good seat.
Everything.
You're a genius.
Miss.
You sunk my battleship.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
The small one.
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
... Very good, sir.
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
Take me. Let the boy go.
WHICH CAR?
I know. I called them.
Shouldn't we --
He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!!
... A hundred and eight?
Well -- I think you might consider
How do I know you won't keep them all?
I'll take you with me.
... Where are you taking me?
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. -- What's that?
It doesn't protect your head, though.
That's why I wear a target on my chest.
Photo database. I'll do your photos now.
If you don't mind my asking... Who's close to you?
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word.
Because I...  ... Because she'd never speak to me again.
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
Good.  With any luck we'll run into each other.
... Terror.
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
... We could try that.
... Looks like a convention.
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
... Where are you calling from?
Finding out where she is.
What now?
In all these years... Why couldn't I see how it wold turn out?
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
I suggest a nice big bomb.
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
WHAT?
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
WHAT??
It's a detour. They're backed up for blocks!
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
What are you, scared of heights?
I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up --
Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
And what happens if we say no?
That's it.
Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
What?  I improved her a little...
Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
Some.  I am a rich bitch, remember?  I'm quoting.
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
What were you thinking?
Yum, yum.
... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
He's not crazy.
It's gone.
You okay?
I said I'd check with you.
Tom Jones?
One.
Your face smells like a foot.
Hi.....  Roses.
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
Meaning?
About Charles...
Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
No, I'm fine.
Annie, it's me.
I can understand THAT. Neither do I.
Night.
Uh ... yes ...
Excuse me.
Yes.  Ahm... think I'11 ...
What?  What?
What happened?!!!
Ah. Fine.  It's good.  It's great.
She's ... well, she's good.
Great - keep him out of trouble.
Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
No. Perfect.  Looking forward to it. CUT TO:
Er ... pray tell me why?
Exactly.  She's in a surprisingly terrible state.  Isn't she, Bean?
Certainly is.
And a car.
A car sounds sensible.
Sean Connery.
There's a man.  I woke up next to a man ...
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
Sure did.
I vote for Bart.
But is she gonna be okay?
Yes?
Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
It is urgent, sir.
Okay.....
Why thank you sir.
You.
Are you?
The TV.
This sucks.
Yeah, heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.

Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing everything!
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Nnnnaah...We need to watch TV DAMMIT!!!
Uh, huh huh... We'll do it, sir.

Uh... We can't leave Washington 'till we find that chick.
Huh huh. You mean like this?
You mean there's mre than one?
Cool, huh huh.
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Yeah! Boobs. Heh heh. I just wanna say that again. Boobs. Heh heh.
Huh huh. Jack. Huh huh.
What's your problem Beavis?
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Yeah, maybe some chicks too. Heh heh.
Heh heh. Bye bye. Heh heh.
Butt-dumpling...
Turd-burglar...
Dill-wad...
Bunghole...
Butt-snatch...
Uh... dill, um, face...
Um... ass... head...

You already said that, Butt-Head.
Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...

Just make sure it looks like an accident...
Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
Well, if you find yourself getting tired, take a couple of these.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Uh, we didn't score yet.
Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.
Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.

OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Thrr...
I see it. I don't get it.
Deep and hard.
Where did these guys come from?
Agent Hurley...
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
Who knows?
She sure does.
Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's Butt. Huh huh huh.
Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
Yoo-hoo! Travis and Bob Head. Whoo-hoo!
Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
Yup. Huh huh.
Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
You'll be rich!
We're rich in what really matters.
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
God, how I have looked forward to this, honey.
It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
Adam!
I'm not sure.  It feels... frozen.
I am sitting.
What?
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
Look at the publisher.  Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.
This is going to take some time.
What's she doing here?
I don't know.  <u>Jane, Jane, up here</u>!
At least we won't have to worry about her.
No, I'm not putting up with this.
Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
<u>You</u> left me.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
That's all we need.
I don't know... what are you looking up?
Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really <u>moan</u>!  Practice, practice, practice.
Where are your skulls and bones?
You know you're really a pretty girl.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
Then it should be here.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
... Yes this must be him.  Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
Three times.  Powerful number.
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.
Maybe we should knock first?
... acts like she's thirty-five.
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
Who did the sushi?
You can build another one... with her.
Just a hunch.
3:30 I guess.
Give or take a year.
Is this like a trick question?
We were trying to scare your mother.
Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles.
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
Really.  I don't know.
I got an A!
W... We didn't know how to make one.
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
Now, let's get rolling!
No.  What's wrong?
We're...
You're the dead.
What do you expect?  You're dead.
What do you mean?  What's he do?
I want to be dead too.
Life is just... too awful.
Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
Are you a spirit too?
You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
I think so.
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
Of course you do.
No, dummy.  Two.
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
Good girrrl!
Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
That's it!
Just <u>say</u> it.
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
You've got to help them.
Can you help <u>me</u>?
... I will.

Your qu...?  But you're...
I'm beeyoo-teeful.
He's your cousin.
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Why not?
I think she's in with them.
Delia hates it.
My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
<u>This is not a joke</u>!  That sheet was full of ghosts.
They're ghosts.  They do what they want.
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
Delia will cook...
Otho, could you actually... do something with them?
No time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.
I thought I saw something.
Viridian?
Viridian?  What is...?
Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
Maybe Charles does.
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
Look at the tiny figures.
Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
I don't know.
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
Why not?
Their wedding clothes.
Now, you'll barely feel this. It won't hurt at all.
But not for long...
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
An attorney?
Yes.
There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
Yes, Robert. I will.
No, Robert.
... Oh? You've heard?
How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
In a day or two, yes.
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
Yes, Robert - I am.  I'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert.
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
I wish he were here...
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
Certainly, glad to be of help.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
No sir, I don't believe I do.
Oh. I have a message for him.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
Yes. I am.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Yes. Thank you.
Oh? Certainly...
My name is Chance.
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
No. I'm a gardener.
Yes. I lost my remote control.
Oh... Well, I'm very sorry...
Good night, Eve.
Hello, Eve.
Your leg must be getting better.
Yes. It's feeling much better now.
Our greenhouse.
Oh, I like that very much.
Yes, so do we.
Hello, Eve.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
How is Ben feeling?
I know you do - you and your television...  ... Good luck, Chauncey.
Good night, Eve.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
Thank you.
To watch...? To watch me...?
Yes. I like to watch.
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
Hello, Eve.
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.
Do you like it?
... Are you sure you like it?
Yes, I do, it's very good.
Really? Really!!!
I see.
Your foot! Give me your foot!!
So you know Krylov!
Yes, it is very good!
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
... So am I, my boy - so am I.
What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
And I'm Ben.
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
Yes, Ben - he is.
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Yes.
Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way, sir.
... Oh.
No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
Of course. I would like to look.
Very good.
How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...
... Yes sir - elevator!
... Good evening, Louise.
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
Yes. It is.
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
... How long have you been living here?
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
How were you paid?
I was given meals, and a home...
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.
I would like to stay and work in my garden.
Good. That's good. Then if you would please sign a paper to that effect.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
I have no claim, Thomas.
But you won't sign, correct?
Correct.
... Hello.
Sid, it's useless!
I said - try again.
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
That's good... That's good.
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.
No, that won't do any good.
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve...
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
Look, Johanna...
I said good night!
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
No, sir.
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
Well, I'm delighted to be here, my friend. I've missed you.  Here, sit down, get off your feet.
... Well?
I'm afraid so.
You take care too, Bobby.
Mr. Gardiner...
John Makel...
Malkovich!
I never played a jewel thief.
I don't know.
Please, have a seat.
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
The monkey.
Yeah. Okay.
I'm a puppeteer.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
She's very beautiful.
Just an idea I had.
Hi.
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
The ferret?
The iguana.
Right.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.
What?
I'm scared.
I have to go back now.
We'll talk about it in the car.
Don't crowd me, Craig.
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. Well smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
You've always loved the animals.
Us, of course.
Fuck Maxine.
We wish.
And he was with her.
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
Me and John.
Don't forget me.
Life is confusing, isn't it?
Suck my dick!
Shut up!
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
I'm a puppeteer.
I love you so much.
The iguana?
The monkey.
I'm sorry for everything.
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Sure, after a fashion.
Let me try.
That... was... no... simulation.
I know. I'm sorry...
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
Pardon?
Schwartz.
Money, Miss Warts?
Forget it.
Yes?
I said "yes."
I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
I wouldn't know.
I'm right?
Who told you?
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
You married?
Yeah. But enough about me.
The usual, Barry.
Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
Please, let me explain.
It better be.
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Tickets to Malkovich?
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
Sure. It'd be fun.
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
I've fallen in love.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
Hello. Wendy.
No. Don't be an ass.
Can I be anyone I want?
You can be John Malkovich.
Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Why are you being like this?
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Fine. Let's drop it.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Forget it.
Think, Jew florist?
Good morning, Lotte!
Do you?
Says me. Do you dream often?
Do you?
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
But of course.
Count me in.
Oh, be still my heart.
No you mustn't, my child.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
Oh, sorry. Right this way.
You bastard!
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.
I love you, Lotte.
Maxine...
One hour.
I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
Did you see the reviews?
Yeah, I saw them
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
Never heard of it.
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
Is there dancing?
No.
Who needs dancing?
Mr. Malkovich?
Who's calling?
Whatever you're having.
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
Yes, Maxine, yes.
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
I'm getting better all the time.
I'd love to see your work.
Really? Yeah. Okay.
You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!
Vegas. Can you arrange that?
You've got to be kidding.
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
Derek Mantini!
Whatever.
What want ye, girl child?
Then what do I do?
Folks come. Folks go.
Here, let me carry that.
Yonder. Twin chestnuts in the yard.
Well what?
That's the last thing they took from me.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
You getting into bed to think about yellow?
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
You saying whitefolks won. That what you saying?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
Not like He punished me.
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
Was a time I knew what was.
You still know.
No. I'm looking for what I was put here to look for: the back door.
and she is mine...
I WILL PROTECT YOU.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
THE WHITEFOLK?
You best leave that quilt alone. That was grandma's quilt.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN.
Baby, don't be like that.
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
Don't pay to complain.
You on your way home?
You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.
I don't. I have my own.
You grown.
Yes sir
Well, good luck with the job.
Thank you.
May I come in?
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
What you want'em for?
Yes ma'am.
Be here. In case.
In case of what?
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
No. I mean work work.
That was fun.
No, let her rest.
DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
Morning, ma'am.
Go upstairs I said!!
Mama?
Was over to Baby Suggs.
What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
You sure?
I know what I see.
Might see anything at all at 124.
Better ask Paul D.
Can't locate him.
He's sleeping in the church.
The church!
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
I don't know him that well.
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
Her who?
Girl, give it up! We been friends too long to act like this.
Till she showed herself.
Ella.
What run him off? Tell me that!
You?
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
Oh yeah. I got big plans.
Never found out.
It ain't what you think.
You don't know what I think.
She was only-
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
She what run you off? Not what I told you 'bout Sethe?
Paul D.
Yeah. Look bad?
You got to get up from here, girl.
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
She left me. She's gone again.
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
I'm telling you don't say nothing to me.
Yeah. Too sweet. 
Yes sir.
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
What do you think?
He looks like a fuckin' loser.
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
You're not dealing with morons here.
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
Well Dude, we just don't know.
Her life is in your hands.
No, man, nothing is fucked here--
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
The?  Who the fff--
Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.
Yeah, it sucks.
NO RULES!  YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS- OF- BITCHES--
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!
Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.
I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
ANTI-SEMITE!
Nothing.
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
We have the urn.
That is for the urn.
Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes.
Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.
And this guy peed on it.
I am the Walrus.
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
Walter, how--
I'm going home, Donny.
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
Thank you, Donny.
I got eighteen dollars, Dude.
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
Huh?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.
That fucking bitch!
What the fuck is he talking about?
That's fucking exactly what happened, Dude!  That makes me fucking SICK!
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.
WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!
What's that, Walter?
Went alright.  Dude's car got a little dinged up--
Where's your car, Dude?
Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.
They were Nazis, Dude?
Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
Are you gonna split hairs?
No--
Am I wrong?
Well--
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards.
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
I'm not really, uh.
Please!  Please!
Uh-huh.
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
Are these.
No, they--
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
Color?
And was there anything of value in the car?
And what do you do, sir?
I'm unemployed.
Your rug was in the car.
Separate incidents?
Mm.
Thankie. . . Just one thing, Dude. D'ya have to use s'many cuss words?
Yeah.  Thanks man.
Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.
Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
Yeah man.  Well, you know, the Dude abides.
White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?
I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
Jeffrey Lebowski.
Thank you.
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
Excuse me?
You're not interested in sex?
You mean coitus?
No it's fine, really, uh--
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
Now I got--
I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--
The main guy, Dieter--
Dieter Hauff?
Well--yeah, I guess--
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
So Dieter has the money?
I want you to see him immediately.
Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
I want a child.
This was a valued, uh.
Walter, he peed on my rug--
Am I wrong!
Yeah, but--
Okay. That, uh.
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
Huh?
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
You mean--beyond pacifism?
He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!
Am I wrong!
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
Calmer than you are.
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
Just for making the hand-off?
What if it's during a game?
I told him if it was during league play--
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.
Have it your way.  The point is--
It's your roll--
The fucking point is--
It's your roll.
My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. The whites.
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
It is a fucking game.  You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--
What the fuck is going on there?
Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
What the fuck?
Huh?  Oh, him, yeah.  Well I don't see, um-- what exactly is the problem?
C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--
For Christ's sake, Dude.
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
Aw, fuck it.
Whose toe was it, Walter?
FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
Huh?
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
Near the In-and-Out Burger--
Huh?
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
The bulk of the series.
Uh-huh.
Not exactly a lightweight.
No.
Look, man, did you--
Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!
Is the car out front yours?
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
Shit yeah!
What the fuck are you talking about?
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
You know this!
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
Sure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS! ACHTUNG, BABY!!
He can't walk, Walter!
Yeah, I can see that, Dude.
Hey, cool it Walter.
Come on, Walter!.
No Dude.
They shot Donny!
Then what's...
It's a heart attack.
Wha.
Wha. . . Donny--
The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.
A hundred and eighty dollars?!
Walter--
Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!
Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
Dude, I'm sorry--
You're a fuck, Walter!
Who is this?
Okay, listen--
So no funny stuff.  Okay?
Right, Dude.
Friends like these, huh Gary.
I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
Employed?
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
Huh?
I don't know, sir.
Well we--I don't--
Where's the money, Lebowski?
Well. . . yeah.
You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you!
Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.
Am I wrong!?
A world of pain.
All right!  There it is!  It's fucking zero!
This is a league game, Smokey!
We'll take 'em in the morning.
<i>You'll</i> take him.
He's half yours, partner.
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
Survival.
No.  They've been training to hunt you.
The House of Pain.
Nothing.
I'll heal.
What about Nomak?
Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.  There's something driving him beyond the Thirst.  Something we're missing.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
I don't think so.
For what?
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
I don't understand.
Not good.
I want to see the sun rise.
Took you long enough.
Sounds like a plan.
What do you really think?
I'm not giving you a choice, old man.
Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
I'll show you.
Where the hell have you been?
Just out connecting a few dots.
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
Thought you were dead.
I should think that would be obvious at this point.
I don't know about this, man --
He was here.  Watching us.
Nomak?
You're wasting your time, Blade.  The flechette's a dud.
Getting your attention, Paco.
You experimented on your own, son?
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
Maybe it's better that way.
Any casualties?
Two so far.
No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
It depends.  We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.
Scud.
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.
Look, what's your problem?
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
Going on twenty years now.
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
You should've killed her, then.
She hasn't turned yet.  You can help her.
Wait.
Don't even start, old man.
How can you be out here?
Watch me.
Frost!!!
Take him.
You're blind --
But I just got here --
You've been here longer than you think.
I'm sorry, I --
You're joking --
Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
It worked, didn't it?
But, he could've --
He didn't. Get over it.
Preventive medicine.
It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
You don't know that.
What do you see here?
Graffiti --
Look closer.
The way they move, they way they smell --
There are worse things than vampires out there.
Like me.
Some kind of archive --
Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
You get used to the darkness.
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
Blade --
Cancer.
Some. It's been slow --
You don't look so good.
You make it sound like I'm already dead.
I've been better --
How long have we been driving?
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
What are you talking about?
I'm not leaving without you.
You don't understand. The Thirst --
I know. Take some of my blood.
You're a week early.
I was in the neighborhood.
I was afraid that might happen.
Deacon brought me back.
Fight him --
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
You don't have to be.
Then what is it?
I don't know --  Look at this blood smear --
This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
What?
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
The other elders will never let you get away with this!
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
You've been listening in the whole time?
Go on, I'll be fine!
We weren't sure we could trust you.
Habit, mostly, just like this.
Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like Hemolytic anemia?
--which she may have--
Hey, folklore--
Because it means the tree is older than the house.
Try, please, Anna--
What happened to her, where did she go?
Don't know--just that she was afraid--
Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
Closer.
I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
--my God, Nick???
Bullshit! Talk!
Yes.
What're you doing there?
Trying to find the energy.
Sometimes. Where are we going?
I just wanna go <u>home</u>.
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
Mrs. Leavitt--
--I'm not staying here!
Let's talk to your husband--
--he's not my husband!
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
--a six week bun in the oven--
The Witch's voice.
Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
That's a joke?
I haven't killed any--
It's like traveling back in time.
<u>Yes</u>.
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
Your body, your call.
Why is there no "our" here?
You feel no need to get married or anything.
--fine, later, fine.
You said the name "James."
I don't know.
I don't know. Nightmare.
No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
We've looked at half of one tape.
--bullshit!
Get your goddamn--
Sleep.
--you should get back into bed.
I guess, yeah.
What?
Just now?
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
What'd you dream?
Then I'm going--
Whatever you want.
Why?
Beta Cam's still coming back tomorrow, right?
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
--hours before--
The, uh, blur there.
Looks like a rope.
I want amphetamines.
--yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think stole the stuff!?
--no, I think they're all in there.
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
Well, please keep me fucking informed!
--there's something <u>here</u>, Nick--
Fine.
Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
Who do you know who can? Where do we go?
Four in the morning?
It's not about witches, goddamnit!
Hey, Mr. Graduate Fucking Thesis here was s'posed to be driving!
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
I do.
Shut-up.
I've got the Panasonic Portable DVD player.
Ask me what I don't have.
No fucking.
No.
Try a long walk.
Butt-ugly owl.
What're you, nuts?
What're you doing with all this shit?
--coming out of the water--
What?
Too busy eating us?
Just go.
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
Hey, hon'--this is what pays the rent and tuition.
Still don't see it--
My room, asleep, last I checked.
Don't have one.
Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
Fucking owl!
Down there in the Park.
How's she going to know where to--
--things got a way of finding <u>you</u> here.
Next time try putting on shoes--
--I don't know.
Yeah. Me too.
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
<u>What</u>--
--before you lose your emotional lunch.
For "James?"
Goes right along with these two.
No one ever comes here.
What?
The wheel.
--about the Witch--
--a Wiccan--
--turn the goddamn camera off!
I'm not finished.
This isn't about us.
Right. And the check's in the mail.
<u>Now</u> you can bring the vehicle to a stop: there on the left.
Look over there.
--now there.
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
--I dunno, I just woke up--
First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
All I need--
A Cyber Entrepreneurialship.
--still go see the OB in the morning--
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
It's not a real "funny" time for us, okay?
I think it's time to get out of here.
What're you nuts--
--it's less than four feet, just--
One of the printers.
Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.
What?
Not planning on sleeping at all.
Smells Like Teenage Spirit.
At least you still have the tapes.
No. I don't think so.
--no.
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
Motion. Stop there. Play it again.
He'll never know.
Elly Kedward?
What'd you say?
....I don't know.
What?
That's the <u>reason</u>.
I know, I know--
Sure. I'm sorry.
Get some more beer.
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
Whatever.
--I know!
I'm sorry.
Heather.
Yeah.
Okay. Hypothetically.
Shoot.
We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
Don't! You're making me lose my grip.
Or a blood blister--or a bruise.
She's far from "fine."
You're needed here--keep watching--
Anna--
--fuck Anna!
I thought all witches were benign and good.
Does she, goddamnit??
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
--the Sheriff's Office--
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
--thank you for calling--
Your mother's pastor.
What happened to my Dad??
Well I do...
Sort of...
What was that?
See a guy.
What?
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?
You got a girl--am I screwing something up by being here?
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
You wouldn't be putting me out.
...Well, I'd be okay in here--
I couldn't believe it either...
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
Well, I didn't see him anymore, I'll tell you that much.
When you don't they're usually nice.
...You ever get tired?
Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm-hmm.
Abby... you all right?
Ray?... What time is it?
I don't know. It's early... I love you.
Abby--
I said you're bad.
Yeah.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Marty.
All right...
In the trunk.
What do you want to know?
I think someone's watching.
About ten years.
Going out with Meurice.
We don't seem to be communicating--
Christ, I'm getting bored.
...Friday?
See, I never knew that.
Well now you do.
...Hell.
What's the matter?
Back where?
Sign.
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
You owe me for two weeks.
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
What do you mean...
How long did you watch her?
Most of the night...
No. It just made them feel better.
I didn't say that.  Well?
Well what?
What do you think?
You're an idiot.
I want you to go fishing.
Ya catch any fish?
...What?
Ya catch any fish?
Yeah...
...What kind of fish?
Listen, what is it? Is it done?
Got something to show me first?
So it would seem.
Nobody knows you hired me?
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
Has Ray come in yet?
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
I don't know, didn't he call?
You said the usual--
Right. Sorry.
Pour that back.
What.
Don't throw that out.
Right.
What.
This.
That's not the point.
What's the point?
Where?  ...I'm very careful about that.
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
For what?
What?
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
No. I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
I've seen a few.
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.
Yes.
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Anything you can tell me?
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
It's blue. blue velvet.
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
No. not at all.
Who knows you have these?
Only you. and the photo lab.
You're all through with this now?
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
Hello, daddy.

Then, shut up!
Those are my breasts.
Can I feel 'em?
If you want to.
Alright, suit yourself.

Pest control. gotta do your apartment.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Yeah.

What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?

THEN WHAT?
Then you got undressed.

Lie down on the bed.
Sure I'm alright. 
I'll go then.
It's okay. It's okay.

See my nipples?
No. please. I won't.
Yes, I like you.

Yeah. hurry up though.
Frank? .can you stand up?
Who's it, you mean.
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway?. Why are you in so much trouble?
No.
Falling.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Please. please stay.
Hello.
I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy.
Frank is coming?
I'm doing it.
Are you a bad boy?
Whatiya mean?
I want you to hurt me.
Frank would open you.
Shut up.

I asked first.
Sometimes I think I do.
No. it's not Don.
You. what?
I did. are you?
Yes.
I want you to stay with me.

You look beautiful to me.

On a ride.

Good, let's drink up.

No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Terrible. boring.
What else is new?. right?
Yeah. What are you doing now?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
I don't know. he moved away.
I don't know.
Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
I'm here, aren't I?
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
Let's go.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
That sounds good.
Two.
I'll drink to that.
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Okay. yeah, call.
He got a little jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't.
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
No way. I'm about to blow up.

Twice. without her sensing anything?
Yes.
Did you see her undressed?
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
Who, me? Why should it?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Okay. okay.
Goodnight.

I'm really sorry.
You want to go talk to him?
Jeffrey?. Why?
Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you. very much.
What is it?
It's good to see you.

I like that idea. that's a real good idea.
I can't dance fast.
Really?
Just a minute.
Frank!!
Dorothy Vallens?
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
Go ahead.
... Sandy?.
Go ahead!
Hey Jeff.
Are you feeling okay?
uh uh.
It's good to see you, Dad.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Good deal Dad.
This is it.
Be right down.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Do you want the car?
Of course, Jeffrey.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Would you like a piece of cake?
No. No thank you.
Yeah.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
That sounds great!
Anyone else?. Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
I'll get a coat for her.
Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
You can change it if you want to.
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
Oh, I see.  George.  Well, that explains everything.  Open your mouth, George.
Where do you guys want to count?
On the plane.
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.
You'll see for yourself.
Derek!
What is?
Yeah.  I am.
You'll see for yourself.
What is?
Yeah.  I am.
Are you kidding?
We'll take it.
Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, I don't feel so well.
No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in front of your parents.
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Yes, I am.
Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes.
The coca is my responsibility!
Excuse me?
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
It's your grass.
We want some grass.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
It's your grass.
Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight.
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
It's already been negotiated.  It's done.  The money is there waiting.
Not bad for a weekend's work, huh?
Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
That was out of line.
I know.  She needs to slow down.  She's going to blow an O-ring.
What's that?
Get me a six pack.
I don't want to talk about it.
Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
No?
Ah, yes.  The murder.
Nothing.  Just a little project.
What kind of project?
Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
No, my brother.
Because they caught me?
You failed because you had the wrong dream.
Now do you see what I am saying?
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
Great.  I love the Bahamas.
Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
How are we doing?
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
I just got released five minutes ago.
George, are we gonna do this or not?
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
Well, you better get here fast.  I'm sitting on...
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.
We're half a million off.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
Try the closet.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
I love you too, man.
What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's for peace of mind.  It's for the principle.
Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos?
What?
I did not.
No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never.
Cocaine?  How much?
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
In how long?  A week?
You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.
Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad?
I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap.
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
Oh, I see.
Yeah, maybe.
Family.
Beautiful girls?
Keep them coming.
And Diego?
Diego is my brother.
Yeah, well...
Diego?
Yeah.
I didn't come here to drink scotch.
Of course, George.  We are beautiful. We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not like Diego.  We started this, George.
I'm going to California.
I'm going to California.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
Not mad.
Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
No.
Good.
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
I'll tell her.
I meant every word of it.
What do you guys want?
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
What about him?
He's going down, George.  It's election year.  We're not making any deals.
Figured what out?
Tuna.
Figured what out?
Do I know you?
I don't think so.
Why are you smiling?
Why are you smiling?
I don't know.  My name is George.
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
She did that before.
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
But this is...
I said, I've seen it before.
Where are you going?
Don't touch me.  Tell me.  Just answer the question.  What do I spend?  What? How will we live?
Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
Yeah, you will.  Of course.
Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.
Is she here?  Is she coming?
Better than you.
What's happening to us?
How are you doing?
What?
Do what you want, it's a free country.
Yeah, sure, whatever.
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
California.
I don't know.  Maybe California.
You swear?
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
There's schools in California.
You swear?
I swear.  On my life.
Swear on my life.
I swear on your life.
I didn't mean to...
I know, Dad.  I know...
Shhhh.
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
Because she's visiting me.
We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's lockdown time.
Yes, I do.
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Let the record state the witness has identified, Diego Delgado.
They're over at the booth.
Very nice.  I'll take it.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
What?
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
That's right.
You know, he's got a point.  We're fucking Americans.  We stick out like sore thumbs.
Don't be such a pussy.
No. It has failed in its objective.
Exactly.
And here?
It depends on you.
Second name.
Second district ...
Second district ... Explain better ...
Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
What "group"?
Third group.
Third group. What's your assignment?
Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
Don't move, Hacene.
What's happened to you?
The NLF has condemned you to death.
You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!
I'll explain.
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
Then don't complain.
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
Sure ...
Here?
It's a question of habit ...
It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
Good evening, sir.
Rue de Thbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
Good evening, sir.
A name?
Yes, a name for the operation.
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...
Yes ... But let me first see you.
No -- but I got something.
What would Joanne Braslow need with an estate attorney?  She wasn't even mentioned in Marsh's will.
Thanks, Mister D.
Cause?
That's what my report will read.
But there's more?
Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene?
A massive cardiac arrest.
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
What induced it?
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
Like cats and dogs.
What did they argue about?
Could you be more specific?
Your witness.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
You may call your next witness.
Counsel approach the bench.
You're bluffing.  John, it's me, remember?  I've known you since your name was Juan Carlos.
Aren't they all?
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
You get his statement?
No.  I haven't done it in years.
Why did you come by?
I had some papers to pick up.
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
I assume his girlfriend.
Rebecca Lawson.
No -- but I can get it for you.
What about Miss Lawson?
Yes.
How did he look?
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
Yeah.
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
She was here?
Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
How long were you together?
For about one year.
I had a bad heart.
I had bypass surgery.
And how are you now?
She left me.
She didn't.  She just left.
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson?
Who was your primary beneficiary?
She was.
Thank you.  The State rests.
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
We stopped seeing each other.
Yes -- Insulin and others.
Cocaine.
I was angry.
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
Why does she come to you?
She suffers from severe menstrual cramps.
Chinese peony root.
It's a white powder that comes in a vial.
High school?
Then -- those are not your own words?
Where did you meet him?
We dated for about a month last year.
Yes -- he did.
How?
No.
What about Miss Lawson?
Yes -- cocaine.
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
Yes.  I suppose it's possible.
He video taped you.
That bastard!
You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
A.M -- or P.M.?
P.M.
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
Frank -- what are you doing here?
No further questions.
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
Something like that.
We're not animals.
How?
Sure.  Where to?
I know.
No -- it just doesn't look right.
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
I'm the photographer.
Oh -- Well, they're different.
That's not an answer.
It's not my taste.
Tastes can change.
Hi.  It's Frank.
Hi, Frank.
No -- not at the office.  I've got a better idea.
It's okay.
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
Yeah.
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
What would?
You and me -- making love.
No -- that's what I know you were thinking.
You take a lot for granted.
What?
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
I went out on the boat.
Of course.
It's only the beginning.
You can see me now.
Paley could be a problem tomorrow.
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
Honey.
Tonight we open new doors.
Are you scared?
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
He was only doing what he thought was right.
No -- you're not.
No -- I'm a survivor.
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
She's waiting in the conference room.
Is Mom yelling at you too?
I love you too, Dad.
Why?
Because I'm expecting a call.
-- But it's Sunday.
I gotta go.  I'll call you later.
That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.
Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
Mr. Roston?
You better.  Please answer the question.
This is not relaxing.
Really.
I'm always open to learning new things.
I know.  What can I do?  He is the boss.
He could let you have your vacation.
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
Yeah -- but can she cook?
Yes.
Why don't you talk to him now?
No one's asking you not to work.  I just think you could make some time for your son.
Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.
We have to talk.
Because I knew you'd think exactly what you're thinking.
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael.
Talk to me.
Please -- not now.
It was a place to start.
Is this what you want -- huh?  Is it?
That's too bad.
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
Daddy -- stop it!
We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
What time did you leave?
No -- never.
It had to get there somehow.
It didn't get there from me.
Well, that's a long time.
It's not that long.
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
I said NO!
I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
No.
No. You can have them.
Lawyer here?
Well, there's a problem.
What problem?
Michael.
What?!
Come here a minute.
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
Well, what am I supposed to think?
No. We're going to lock this up and --
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
I bet mom could've helped her.
Nobody did.
Was this during Betty?
Oh, yes.
She used to be so friendly.
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
She changed.
Heat is heat.
Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
That's it.
Hmm-mmm.
That must be it. It's a great smell.
After the divorce.
Oh.
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
Oh! You caught me.
I found this Chicago station before. Wait a minute...  Here it is.
Want another cigarette?
Sure.
Francesca. Robert.
Sure.
Not at all.
About a year and a half.
No, your kids.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Must be nice having kids.
Why?
Clean?
Yes. Very clean.
Much.
Is the dizziness gone?
I think so.
She starts sniffing me.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
We got engaged.
Oh you!
Why, do you think?
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
Do you miss it?
They have safaris for tourists now. Maybe you can convince your husband.
You get used to it.
When?
No. I'm all right. It's working.
Are you all right?
Francesca?
What?
I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
But no one in particular.
No. But I love them just the same.
But it's not the same.
What made you ask such a question?
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
Yes! Hi.
Am I interrupting anything?
No. I was just... No.
I would love to come for dinner.
I'll pick you up.
Yeah. See you later.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
I want you to come.
Oh, how is he?
Yes, that'd be nice.
Are you hungry?
No.
What?
How about Bari?
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
I sat outside and had coffee.
Why do you say that?
Because I already tried once.
No, I don't mind.
What were your parents like?
What?
Am I too heavy for you?
Yes, thanks.
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
TO HELL WITH YOU!
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
Later. Go back to sleep.
Where you going?
I can't sleep.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
I'm going to miss you.
It's only four days.
Hmm?
What's her name?
Betty.
What's she like?
Okay.
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
What happened?
They're not going to find her!
Yes, they are.
Apparently just before her death.
You people really don't like dogs.
Some holes can't be filled.  Some hungers can't be satisfied.
Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
Hell no!
Then what do you care?
Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.
How the hell should I know?
Yeah?
So what the hell's the good news?
Take who where?  What you smokin'?
Damn.  It's so...fresh.
I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
Naw.  I think it's... I dunno.  Something about it just buzzes me.
Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
Spooked?
Yeah, there is a strange vibe here.
Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
Anywhere but here.
Or just Hell-adjacent...
That's some terrible shit.
Bones.
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
But things change.  You gotta think ahead.
I said, no thanks.
Go on.  It won't kill you.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
Where we'll always be...
But.
Hush, baby.
Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when we was his age...
How did you get in here?
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
I have to finish this for class.
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
Your father.  He was your father.
My God.  My dress.  We have to find it. And burn it.  And shut the door.
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
How do you know?
I manage them.
That place is already bad luck.
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
And you believe her?
What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.
I'm sure I can make your mother like me. But then do I gotta worry 'bout your father?
It's alright.  If you want to go home...
My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.
Bill!  Bill?!
Patrick, he's...
Okay, okay.  Listen:
I can't!
Back here.  At the end of the block.
You got the shit?
Let me see it.
Where is it?
Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
Dad?
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
Well, somebody bought it.  That's what I heard.
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
That's it.  Get out.  Now!
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
No time for eightball.  I got your tip.
I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
It was just like in my head.
Yeah, you heard of him?
You haven't?
Not that I remember.
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
Why not?  He eats everything else.
The blood is still there.  We just gotta figure out where.
Ours!
What we have to do is call the police.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
Here, put this in his mouth.
You want to get into this now?
No, no, Caesar.  Not now.
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
Two point one seventy-six.
Just admit it, Caesar.
Admit what?
Open the case!
All right!  Where's the key?
You don't need a key.
The same way you did before.
I think you're fucking crazy!
Where is it?
Where's what?
The money!
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
Yeah, I know.
Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
Stay away!
No!
Gimme the gun.
I can't.  I can't.
Give it to me.
All part of the business.
What the fuck is going on?
Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
I'm sorry, Christ, I thought ... it's fucking dark in here.
Jesus, Caesar!
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
What are you going to do with it?
Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
I'm sorry.  It was an accident.
There's no time.
What are you talking about?
They just left, didn't they?
What are you, drunk?
That doesn't make any sense.
Why?
It was him.  I'm positive.
It's impossible!
Caesar, maybe we should run --
Violet, please!
The hell I can't!
I need you ...
For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
They're just cops.  Stall them as long as you can.
Caesar, someone could see us out here.
Where, then?
We're going to need some time.
Who are you going to call?
Don't tell him --
Shut up, Violet!
He can't kill you --
Don't try to tell me what to do.
You need the money just like we do.
Everything you couldn't.
You murdered Gino!
I had to.  You made me.
They were in a car accident.
But everybody is all right.
They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
I should have let him kill you.
You know he would have done you, too.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
Pretty good, sir.
Oh, right.
Where's the fucking money?
No.  Rajeev's in India.
Five.
I should be going.
What?  How about a drink?
Sure.
Where is it?
Why?
I could be lying.
Hey, Mickey.
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
Caesar, you still got the money?
I thought I heard someone knocking.
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
Me?  Why?
Hey, if Violet was helping me relax, I'd probably do the same thing.
Yeah, that's it.
Fuck it, I don't need the key.
Where in the hell is he?
Oh yeah.  Violet!
Leave your phone on the hook.
This is the police, ma'am.
How do I know you are cops?
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
You did the right thing.
...  thank you.
Pretty much.  One day at a time.
Good guess.
You're doing everything yourself?
Truck.  Of course.
'63 Chevy.
I knew it.
I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
My pleasure.
Yeah, come on in.
I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?
No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
What do you want?
A beer?
A beer.  Of course.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
...  yes.
Tell me about it.
You have to ask?
No.
Basically.
Almost five years.
Five years is a long time.
Yes, it is.
What?
I'm glad you did.
So am I.
Nothing.
I'm not afraid of anything.
I don't understand - ?
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
What the fuck was it?
Work.
You mean Shelly?
I think so, too.
Then what?  Exactly.
He hung it up.
What?
To let it dry.
In his office.  I saw it this morning.
Does the case lock?
Like each other?  They hate each other.
...  shit.
Sweet Jesus.
What happened?
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
He does it right in front of him.
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Waiting in the apartment next door.
Shit!  Oh shit!
He won't.
If he does ...
The same way I'll know that you went to Scotch.  Trust.
Why?
You'll be clean and we'll be rich.
Thank you.
What happened?
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
We're almost there, Violet.  just hang on.
I was so afraid you ...
Hey.
How'd it go?
I'm here, aren't I?
...  Me neither.
Hey, Johnnie ...
I think everything is okay.
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
I'm not asking.
-- if we can get a clean shot --
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
What do you want to do?
We don't know what we're into!
You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
I can't call it off.  He's not responding.  Get out of my way.
...which one are you?...
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
...it's a problem...
...they won't let you go...
Why?
We have to go home, Jason.
Jason Bourne is dead.
Jason...  They can't let you go...
That'll be their second worst mistake.
Get the kids out!
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
You have your passport?
Look, maybe I should just...
Sir, you waited on line.
Yeah, I know...

Paris?
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
You are a friend of his?
His brother.  You know his brother?
Right.  Yes.  Of course.
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
Excuse me?

It's a little late for that.
Get the fuck away from my car.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
I want to go home.
You have blood on your pants.
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
What if I say no?
Then I'll find another ride.
What does that mean?
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...

I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
I don't know.
I was shot twice in the back.
Okay, so you're a victim.
Where are we?
We're about an hour away.
I can't believe I slept.
I thought about it.  I don't know.
That's it?  Is that it?
No.  No.  Go around.  Keep going...
I guess.
I don't remember any of this.
Thanks for the ride.
Anytime.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
-- quiet -- <u>quiet</u> --
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
No.
I trusted you.
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
I didn't know this would happen.
-- how? --
-- we'll tell them what happened --
It's a company... MPG Capital.
Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.
What is that?
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
Go back to the hotel.
Yes.  That's who I want to be.
What?
I won't let that happen.
xxxxxx
We have to keep moving.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
I can't protect you anymore.
What about you?
This your store?
Yes.
You have ID?
So get the hell out of here.
-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
My husband's out looking for him.
He run away often?
What?
I'm sorry.
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
xxxxxx
That's the only angle.
What's that?
-- I'm on it --
Abbott wants to talk.
Tell him we're busy.
I tried.
-- he accessed the account --
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
I told you.  You need to rest.
I don't know.
Uh - what? - I ...
I fixed it myself.
What have you done to my flat?
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
...ditioning.
Machines don't fix themselves.
... fix themselves.
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
...ampered. with it, Spoor.
... have a look.
Got there!
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
... ere please.
What? How do you know my name?
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
We know that too. You've come to the right place.
It's reply paid.
You don't have to sing it.
Oh, right ...
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Her name is Jill.
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
He will be pleased when he comes home.
That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.
Well ... well, I ...
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
I understand, Sam, I know exactly how you feel. So I brought you a bottle of barley water.
Jack!
Long time no see!
Even later.
Really? - God, how time flies!
You remember Alison?
Remember how they used to stick out?
Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
SAM! What a surprise!
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
What?
What is it?
How much do you know?
Not much.
Enough though, eh?
Not really, no.
Christ! You do know it all!
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
He's a freelance subversive?
Very smart.
Yes. I'm impressed.
Tell me about Layton.
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Out of kindness.
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
You're the only person I can trust.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
They weren't at school with us.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
Say it was a mistake.
We don't make mistakes.
Do you know what you're doing.
Trust me.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
Yes we have, Jack!
Shut up!
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
What?
Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
How do you think I feel? You shit!
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
Stamped?
Information Adjustments.
You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?
It's you ... it's you ...
Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
Don't look back! Act naturally!
Good!
Please!
Oh, sorry.
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
It's my fucking life.
Yes, of course. Sorry.
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
I didn't like it.
What?
Where are you taking me?
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
Where are you taking me?
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
What parcel?
A heavy Christmas present.
No, really.
Really.
Suit me?
What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
They couldn't be worse for the Buttles.
Well, no system is.
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Well, all wars do -
Who is this war against, Sam?
Well, terrorists of course.
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's only my first day.
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Turn around!
What?
They'll be there waiting.
Who will?
Security.
I thought you arrested me.
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 
Cut it out, Sam.
Will you please turn back.
Get away!
Turn!
Stop it ... damn you!
Let go! We've got to stop!
Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
Oh God! What have we done?
We? Don't blame me!
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
Shit! The house is on fire!
"And your children all gone."
What?
Please, Jill ... I love you.
Oh ... Jesus!
No you're not!
What happened to you after ...
Your face ... are you hurt?
Are you sure?
Yes.
C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Take care.
It's not our mistake!
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Information Retrieval.
Oh, good!
But if they did promote you
Would you really, Sam?
Really.
You've been promoted.
Tuttle?
Next of kin!
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
You are good to me Sam.
Don't mention it. See you later.
Can I forget it?
Yes.
What's the matter?
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
I did it for you.
What! Shit!
Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
You want to take my console into your office?
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
You haven't switched it on.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
I won't be held responsible.
How long will she he away?
I'm sorry but ...
You remember Samuel, my son.
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
We're meeting Mrs Terrain.
A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?
I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
It's something for executives.
This isn't rare!
Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course you want something. You must have hopes, wishes, dreams.
I want to talk to him.
I know, I know ...!
Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are you going to have?
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
Thank you for calling Cen -
Hello. Mr Lowry?
Who's that? 
What? Who is this?
Er, don't you want to search me?
No need, sir
But I could be anybody.
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
I don't know which numero.
Numero, trois.
Fixed itself.
Emergency procedures.
What is it?
Who fixed your ducts?
Why not? All you've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it, haven't you?
Thermostat's gone. And then some.
It's a 27B/6 of course.
What is this?  Who the hell are you?
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
But ... I called Central Services.
Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm -
No. Wait here.
What do they want you or?
Time to go.
On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor.
I've never fired anyone in my life.
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
No, no, that's impossible.
Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
She say she in great pain.
Thanks for the translation.  What's your name? Nombre?
She's having a baby. Twins.
Es impossible.
It's a miracle.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
In that time, you ever have sex?
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
We are virgins.
Mary ...
He looks like a cop.
He flipped out.
Where is she?
Sleeping in the back.
She asked me to pick her up.
Mary, we really have to go.
Just take it easy.
No!
You're going to live.
What about Kanita?
Dead.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
He's going to be all right, right?
No. He's dead.
No way, man.
IB Bangin.
Well, you have your choice: pills, injection, gas.
What did you say?
Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
No, I'd better not.
Sure, sure, give go.
Yeah?
We'd better go outside. Quickly.
I guess there's always a chance.
The first is always the best.
At least he's got people around him.
That's my brother's problem. He's passed out inside.
Yes.
I think this place stinks.
Did you see my father?
No.
Not as good as Nino's.
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
How long you been doing this?
Five years.
No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend.
You asked me not to come.
Promise you won't go inside.
Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.
There's no time.
Frank.
Come on up.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
God help us, he's hungry too.
What's that, Frank?
Three legs.
That's too many.
Backup?
It's coming.
What look?
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
Greatest job in the world.
I quit! I'm through!
You can't leave me now.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
Crazy fucker.
How can that be? He was getting better.
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
He was tough. You did all you could.
No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.
Yeah. Great, isn't it?
Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
I've taken that into consideration.
You okay?
It's early for him.
Better bring it all.
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
C'mon, look at your screen. Give up some blood!
Who with?
I don't know--let's break some windows.
You learn that in the army?
Do it!
Frank!
Turn here. You missed it. The Chink is on 3rd.
What?
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
What?
Don't push it, Larry.
You're burned out.
They'll just keep calling.
He's drunk.
Faster!
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
You really think so?
Used to be my partner.
You sure?
One more time!
No way!
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
What's wrong with it?
What?
Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
Just don't physically...  Fantastic tip -- fantastic.
I'll find some copy.  Be right back.
No?
The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
They booted me out of Washington.
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
London.  That's a promotion!
I don't think so.
I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.
Are you any closer to a decision?
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
Yes.
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
Which would you prefer?
Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>].
No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
Why do you say that?
Sure.
I'd give anything if that were true.
Eleven and a half.
Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
Did you shoot their boots?
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
Not because you have to.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
A long time.  I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
Did you bring your grey suit?
Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
Yes.
Then it went well.
Did it really go well?
Define your terms.
Do you feel good about it?
I lost six pounds...
Aaron, will you tell me?
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
This is important to me.
No.  You know that I'm not.
Hi.  Will I ever sing again?
Speaking.
I'm going to take it.
Well -- my wife got this new job...
Your hair's a little funny.
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
No -- Don't worry about it.  Let's do this.
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
Yeah --
Upper management thinks you're dull.
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
I understand.  I'll go with you.
Move away from me.
It depends on how big a news day it is.
Uh-uh.  I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.
What is she shooting?
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
Oh, come on -- tell us another.
Yes.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
He said something about...
No stop where he's all besieged.
Right there, Bobbie.
No, I don't think so.
How do I get out of here?
You talked me into it.
One's enough.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
I wish it were you giving the story.
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
I'll speak to you.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
They fired me.
Okay, sweetie.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
Why so glum?
I don't know.
Go ahead.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
As long as that's your only problem you're...
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
It's not opinion.
Fill for a second.
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
How's it going?
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie and I serve anonymously.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
You're great at taking the edge off a good time.
Excited.
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
I'll be the judge of that.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
I'll get you through.  Move and smile.  And smile and move...
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...
Why, you need me for the story?
No.  Were you going to you?
Uh-huh.
We can go together.
Who?
Me!
Great.
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
This is hysterical.
Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
Where are you?
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
Yes.
Good night??!
You fucking...
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
You want to come?
It's better when you let me say it.
Go ahead -- what?
I can't be.
Right back to you.
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
Through the closet.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm sorry.
The way you were looking at me, I just went.
Not anymore!
I just might.
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
What, right now?
Uh-huh.
Shh!
Are you nervous, Walter?
N-no...
I already told you I'm not.
You're breaking my concentration!
Are you a virgin?
I'll pose any way you want.
Anything new?
You know it.  I'm out of here.
What did he do?
He made a cat.
Righto.
Of course...it's wonderful.
It's a...full length life-size figure!
Yeah it was all just an accident.
You can do anything you want if you set your mind to it.
Now you're a professional!
Better!
Well I can't say that Walter!  She's incomparable.  They're both great.
Here here...
Sorry...
Yes Walter.
All about me...
Every word...
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
Thank you.
Are you ready?
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
I know.  But I wanted to talk to you.
Bye!
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
Of course I do!
That means you like me!
Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.
Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
What?
Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
Is it?  I've forgotten.
What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
When did you make this, Walter?
I'm honored to know this man.
Do you have to be so cold to him?
I'm totally serious!
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
Nothing...nothing at all.
You see the direction his realism takes! It's unhealthy!
I know.
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Let's check out the scene.
Didn't you hear him?
No man I'm on my own plane.
Maxwell gave him a bottle of wheat germ oil.  Maybe he started taking it.
Yeah, right outside the door!
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
What is it, your laundry?
Huh?
I didn't buy it I made it.
I said I did, didn't I!
Dead Cat?
Yeah.
You want me to buy Dead Cat?  It'll scare people away.
Got carried away, huh?
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
Good night Walter.
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
What, Mr. De Santis?
You might talk too much.
Yeah and what would I say?
It was.
Just wait till you see this!
Never mind...
Excuse me I have to make a call...
Uh, hi.
Did you see my cat?
Yeah I did.
You're like an undercover guy!
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
Turn around!
Walter shut up and relax!
NO YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME DON'T SHOOT -
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Yes, get rid of them...
Did you like it Mister Brock?
Call me...Maxwell.
Good morning Walter!
Suit yourself.
Hiya Maxwell.
Why not?
I don't!  But fifty thou?  That's not money, that's manna!
What do you get?
Your work, the layers of irony.
T-turned on?
Then let me give you something then...
If you see him.
OK Mrs. Swicker.
Good night, Mrs. Swicker -
Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.  Somebody's got to.
What's the matter with you!
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
Cheer up.  You may still.
I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
Litter, yeah!
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Yes!
Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.
Suck!
Wrong answer!  No prize.
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
We're looking at a dog, possible coffee...
Amazing!
We hate you guys!
Bummer metaphor.
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?
You look like shit, Benny.
Get away from here.
I'm hungry.
I mean it.
You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
Which way did she go?
Down there.
What's playing there?
Probably.  What movie is this?
Eeyuu.
Hi, guys.
Uum... around ten?
Yeah?
What's Bobby gonna say?
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
Aren't we the chatty ones.  Kiss noise.
I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
Something like that.
It's the news, Buffy.
Nothing.
Come on, what was it?
Nothing.  It was just a dream.
Hi.
So I noticed.
I thought we were meeting here.
I'm here with Jenny.
Didn't you get my message?
You broke up with my machine?
You weren't home.  Like always.
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
I think you've forgotten something.
I am so sure.
It could happen.
Water.  Okay.
They were vampires, weren't they?
Yeah.
God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.
Where are you gonna go?
Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
I'll back that up.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
Yeah?
Why'd you come back?
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
Merrick...
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
Dress, huh?  What for?
For the dance.
Come again?
I'm going to the senior dance.
Second word... sound like 'dance'.
What for?
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
Pretty shallow of you.
That's me.
I'm glad you came.
Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.
Bogutude.  Blow it off.
I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
Like my homework.
) What do you think?
Please.  It's so '91.
Why don't we see a movie?
Well, where?
Nice ensemble!
'Just remember you're in training, son'
Where?
Cafe Blase.
Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
Get out of my facial.
You look way pretty, Kim.
I know.  I like your little outfit.
Am I in trouble or something?
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
To bring you... your birthright.
My birthright?  You mean, like a trust fund?
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
In Virginia.
I have to show you.
Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy. Beauty ida.
Cramps?
None of your business.  God.
This is it.
We wait for Robert to wake up.
She --
I have cheerleading squad.
Skip it.
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
We'll cover it later.
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
Sporting events, yeah.
Who we gonna beat?
No -- you don't have to --
Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
But you threw a knife at my head!
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
Same one.
Oh.
You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps.
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
A what?
Five.
How can you keep doing this?
It isn't important.
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
Vampires of the world, beware.
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
He knows who I am!
Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.  Ooh!
They don't even have Dolby.
Good enough!
Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
I was just scared is all.
No.  It was mondo bizarro.
Thank you very much.
Nobody is even gonna look at the game.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
I guess.
Later for it.
Hi.
Oh.
So very much.
My parents have money...
Swear to God.
You are much more.
Hi, Grueller.
You think so?
Could be.
Jeffrey!
Okay, let's go.
But --
Where'd you learn how to do that?
Okay.
Nee sitch.  No way.
I gotta bail.  You coming?
Does Jeffrey know?
Hey, wait a minute...
You want some punch?
He is so bald.
Like we don't have rights too?
Oh, please.
Okay.
Right!
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
Nice much.
Like you've got a grip.
Right.
As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?
I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
No...  You want me to give him a message?
I don't think so.
All right.  Take care of yourself.
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
You said "Crash".
They did when they were in the Carolina League.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
My right nostril?
He's handled a lotta pitchers whose records were better than one and six.
A little better.
Gimme the God damn ball!
Get over here.
No.
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh--
How 'bout a back rub?
No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
You can't seduce me.
I know what it is.
Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
I'm trying to play with your body!
I knew it--you're seducing me!
You're exotic and mysterious and cute--that's why I better leave.
I'll be back when we lose.
it's okay..
Oh--won't YOU come in?
--but you're father's in there!
Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
How can I possibly thank you?
I won't be needing these anymore.
I think I'm ready for the Show.
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place
He's a virgin.
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
I don't dance.
Crash, I didn't think you--
I'll learn.  C'mon--
G'night.
So...Wanta make love?
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
You're pulling your hips out.
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
Let me.
You got me all confused.
Aren't we all?
Don't you think I'm pretty?
He won't make love to me anymore.
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
I'm ready for a complicated man.
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
Annie, I think you should leave.
No.
I heard already.
Yeah...you a witch?
Not yet.  It takes years of practice...
What?
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
Three-fourteen?  Hmmm...  Look't those thighs, Jackson
He looks great, just great!
Ninety-five miles an hour...
That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
He looks wonderful, Jackson...
Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?
She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ...
You need a nickname.
That's what I been telling everybody!  Wanta dance?
Oh both of you, of course...
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
The socks?  It's cold in here.
You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on?
Who's he play for?
If you believe in Voodoo.
I'm 0 for 16!  Gimme some of that shit.
C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!
You missed him!
It was a cocksucking call!
Did you call me a cocksucker?
I didn't spit on you!
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
You're outta here!
Don't think.
Awright, meat, give him your heat.
Well, I held it like an egg.
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
How?
Yep.
God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
I won't have to.
What?
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
I'm nervous--my old man's here.
Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.
Then go.
Let go of me!
C ' mon!
Why am I a fuck?
What?
Forget it.
I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.
Yeah, thanks for everything.
You too...Meat.
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
Crash, shut the door.
Love to--
Pussy.
I ain't hitting a man first.
Hit me in the chest with this...
Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
See ya at the yard, Meat.
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
You can do anything you want.  Hop in.
We're getting married.
Ain't he warning up?
Better find our bonus baby, eh?
C'mon big 'un, you're okay...
It's a league record.
Struck out eighteen...
Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
...and one helluva guy.
It's a damn convention.
Check it out.
Jim looking for somebody.
Who ain't?
Looking for Crash Davis.
Ain't here.
I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
Well, I'd rather not say.
Don't tell him I told you--he'd break my neck.
...he did what he was told.
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
What?
Hello, Senator.
Good to see ya.  William would you...
That's right.
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
You were wandering around.
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
A powerful man.
Philip, if you would rise.
I'm serious. No interference.
Watch it, partner, watch it!
The worst was Blue.
Yeah.
Congratulations.
All right, take care.
Wait, hold on a second.
Hey!
Hold on a second.
Hey, little Dale Evans.
Hello.
Lester...
Uh, I'm not. Sam, I wouldn't...
Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
I'll call you right back.
Right back.
I can't! I'm tied!
Wh-wh -
I don't know.
Ohhh...
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
If his girlfriend was knocked up.
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
Somethin', huh?
Yeah.
Ginger.
You mean, I have your permission?
It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
All right, Ace?
Okay.
Thanks, pal.
Listen...
Hey.
I don't wanna come along with you.
Just say so.
I'll be honest with you.
All right, fine.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
What happened to me? What happened to you?
You lost your control.
I lost control?
Yes, you lost your control.
Yeah.
Please...
...to me.
She came to talk to me...
That's right, yeah.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
And at the...
What - what, Caesar's?
No, a...
...hundred yards further down the road.
I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
Yeah.
And what'd she want?
She was afraid to call you.
Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
It's me.
Nick?
No, I'm not okay.
How'd you know I was here?
She's there with you?  She's there with you?
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. Don't fuck up in here.
How do you do?
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
Oh, thank you, sir.
You bet.
I'll come by.
Seven o'clock?
Seven o'clock.
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
And they were usually right.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
You've got to stop her.
What can I do?
Half of everything is mine.
Ace, listen to me.
Half - I'm comin' down. 
Well, sir, I was just...
Why is she eight pounds over?
...position...
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
No. Just stop everything.
We can't get rid of him?
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
Why not make them happy?
Call security.
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
Here we go. Good luck.
What is it?
He's gonna come up with ten thousand, just the way you wanted.
Right away. Okay?
I-I'll do it.
Okay. 
Ginger's mission in life was money.
I'll be right back.
See you, Ginger.
That was all bullshit. She just pocketed the cash.
Hey, Mitch.
...pit bosses, floor managers.
Thank you.
But mostly...
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
Understand?  I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Why're you crying?
I'm not crying. 
You're with me now.
Yeah.
Right?
Uh-huh.
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, it's so soft.
It's nice isn't it?
Oh...
You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
What do you need?
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
Yeah.
Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
You can't make me stop caring...
What? What?!
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
I gotta tell ya...
...under?
Pretty serious.
How serious?
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
It's under...
...twenty-five thousand?
Yeah.
And...
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
All right...
With what?
He needed some clothes.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
He wanted a watch, too.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
Mm-hm.
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now.
Let go of me! Let go of me!
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
Fuck you!
And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
You're not takin' Amy.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
I threw it away.
Oh.  I got your cigarettes.
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
And where'd you go?
To the Riviera.
I had a... salad.
What did Jennifer have?
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
Who were you with?
I was with somebody.
I mean, it could get us both killed.
I can back him off.
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
Listen to me.
Fuck you.
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
You understand? What? Let you go?
I want you to let me go.
I wouldn't do that...
Get up! Get going!  Get up!
Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!  Fuck you!
Just wait there for me!
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Don't you threaten me!
I'm not -
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
If she calms down...
They had all the pieces they needed.
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
...twenty years in order to find nothin' on me -
How many kids do you have?
Mr Rothstein.
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
This is not the way to treat people.
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
No, Sir.
Well, I... I never tried.
So, you're a righty?
What?
Is this yours? Your pen?
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
Get out of here.
Thank you.
Yeah.
I didn't give 'em the m-
Shut your mouth!
You shut up.
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
What else? I gave her a schaff [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.]
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
He won't...
Please.
That's not a problem, that's not a p-
Can I go in?
Jeff, would you go in with her?
And here. Here.
Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca-
Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where you goin' -
It looked like a fuckin' gun!
Hey!
Okay.
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy!
Yeah?
Here we go!
You've gotta be kidding me! 
I did - I didn't -
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
He tries to do everything...
Is that the last one?
Great!
Yeah, we're lookin' for Carmine.
He's gone?
He's not here?
Carmine's gone.
Uh-huh.
Calm down! Calm down!
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
Stay out of the way!
Artie! Artie!
We can't help him if -
But I'm just trying to leave.
How are you?
E mo va! [Italian-American slang for 'Now, go!']
It's in all the papers.
What're you gonna do?
And I mean... that's no good.
I know.
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
Okay.  Frankie, you're a good boy.
Definitely the most important guy in this room.
That's enough now!
Fine.
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
Hi, how are you?
Am I right?
All right?
Yeah.  Thanks.
Yeah.
It's all right.
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
Nothin'.
Yeah.
Okay.
You know?
Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's probably got it there too.
Exactly.
Yes, you did.
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
Everything went to his head. 
Is that what you want?
Yeah.
A sponsor.
Yeah.
It's what you want?
Yeah. Uh-huh -
Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
You fucked with me for the last time!
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
Well, you might as well get somethin' out of it.
But I saw something...
Thank you. Very nice.
I told you I was hot tonight.
What's the matter?
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
What do you mean 'stole'? I didn't steal anything from you.
Get lost?
Yes.
Get lost?
Come on! 
Okay?
Yeah.
I'm always here for you.
You are.
I am.
I love you.
Do you know that?
God... I wish you...
You do?
Okay, then.
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
You got money. That's a - That's a good look.
Right.
Here.
I just talked to him.
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
'Go! Go! Go!'
She started it. She started the whole thing. I'm just standin' here.
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
You're driving me nuts!
...they're in Penthouse K.
They check in alone?
They checked in alone.
Are they out now?
Yes, don't worry.
All right.
I think that's it.
Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?
All right.
Two?
You know why, right?
Yeah.
What a smart kid you are!  Okay, eat.
Hold it, hold it. Here.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
You jag-off.
Come here, come here.
Get up.
This peter's a motherfucker.
Every night, on the couch.
Yeah?
Hey. This is Shelly.
Hey, Shelly. 
Stacy. 
This is Nick.
Pleasure.
...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs...
But he never talked.
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
They want a fuckin' war, I'm ready.
They're havin' a good time too.
So are we.
Go fuck yourself.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Yeah, what's to stop him?
I know. I know.
Oh, he ain't nobody.
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
They'll do it.
Dominick said they're in the motel?
Shh.  Hide her car in the back!
Get out. Get out! Get out!
Take it easy!
Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here. You know that? Bad fuckin' spot.
No more! You see? Watch!
Fuck you, you motherfuck!
Take him out! Take this motherfucker out!
Ch-Charlie M!
Charlie M?
Charlie M.
Hey.
How you doin'?
How you doin'?
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
I'm positive.
Well, I'm a little confused here.
You're a little confused?
Yeah.
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
Mr. Chairman -
What's the matter with you?
I'm sorry.
All right, all right. But I - I -
You'll get a heart attack like that.
Having a good time?
Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings?
Crowd always buys it. What do we got?
Adonis, be polite. She's a friend.
Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
Guilty. I am.
I don't know. I can't remember.
You're probably right.
I'm sure.
Uh Brock, today you are without me...
I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
Oh, how long have you had your own route?
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
She has a real spirit.
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
I suppose she does.
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
Priceless...We have a showdown in this alley, right?
Wha-at?
Catwomen. Lots of them!
Well then, let's agree to disagree...Now how about a picture for my scrapbook?
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
Touchy. Look everybody, it's Casper, the friendly crimefighter...
"Well done," Cactus.
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
What did you say?
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
Absolutely.
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
Now he'll be up all night...
You think so?...Selina?
You've seen me...
Spear.
And I...I..want you to know our secrets..
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
What's the name of your child's best friend?
Ask me another one--
Enough.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
What did--?
You turned around!
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
What?
Uh-huh..
Yes, Mother. Dear.
Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
Trust me, you won't have to.
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
Thanks.
Any place.
This is one way.
I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.
Do I hear a woman's voice?
I won't let him.  He belongs to me now.  Bye, sweetie.
That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
You could've made me lose my call.
Theo wants to talk again.
Did you have to tell her my name?
This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
You gotta just look the other way.
I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
You could've killed us.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!
Why would I do that?
I'm going to level with you officer.
Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
What else did you expect him to say?  Do it, Theo -- or give me the gun.
You can tell she was really worried about me.
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
It's taken care of.
That's your "rep."
Will you relax?  This in no way affects our business.  Go on.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
If you know that just back off.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
And stop with the directions.
Make a "U" and go back.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
What do you keep making me out to be?
I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
What am I supposed to do?
There's a taxi stand here.  I can meet you.
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
And what're you whispering for?
I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
You're the one who's not to be believed.
I don't want to know --
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
Oh won't I?
Because you know you'll be killing us.
Don't lay this on me!
Then hang up!  Do it!
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
Bottom line!  There's nothing I can do for you but tip the cops.
She would if she heard my voice on the phone.
What about the others?
Tell me what she looks like.
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
Hey drop it, okay?
Sometimes I paint.
Our house always needs touching up.
They say my work is somewhat derivative.
Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
I'm about ten blocks from the school.
You're breaking up.  I can't hear you.  Theo?
I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.
I can hear you again, clearly.
No.
I've got to ask somebody.
She's gone --
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
What bank?
The City National on San Vincente.
What do you mean?
Black Mercedes, 600S.
Don't say that.
Do you know what's in that box?
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
To hide it from the I.R.S.
What's going on?
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
No.
Did you hear that click?
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
Or somebody else there is listening in --
Don't panic.  I might be wrong.  Hello?  I guess I was wrong.
Try what you did before.  It worked before.  I won't talk anymore.
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
What did you do?
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
Put the man back on.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
They put their hands all over me.
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
There isn't any such person.
Whose money is this?
Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
Damned if I know.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
There was <u>no</u> cop involved.  Oh shit!  Fuck!
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
You knew about me.
L.A.P.D.
Shit.  You couldn't be in much worse shape.
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
What's that supposed to me?
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
259-7881.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
Some people fall apart in a pinch. But you shine.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
Naturally.
Only one way to find out.
That's how it's going to be.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
Pull over!  Pull over someplace.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
I don't want it.
I told you ... sooner or later you'd have to trust me ...
Who is this?
You mustn't hang up.
Didn't we play this scene before?
I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
I wish it had never been invented.
We don't see you.
I still don't see you.
And not a nickel.
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
I'm backing up.
Put the girl on.
Better reassure him.
Call me "Nels."
I think I've already had a "quickie."  Thank you.
You couldn't be calling at a worse time, Nels.
What does it take to kill you?
I suppose you're in your taxi?
My compensation!  Somebody still owes me -- big time!
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
Five minutes.
Where do I turn?
We're gonna get there first.
I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Seems not.
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
Mind if I have a look?
Tell the truth, I was going to take a much needed leak.
Let me talk to the lady again.
Government business?
Very official.  259-7881, if I recall.
I thought so.
From here on, I dish it out.
Is that good or bad?
So who's he?
Then why doesn't she?
Whatever you say.
See what, Dil?
He gave me a look.
Did he?
What you think?
Nice.
What would you call it?
Now, that was a look.
She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
What do you think his name is?
I've no thoughts on the subject.
Hi, Jimmy.
Persistent.
Good thing in a man.
An excellent quality.
I would expect he does.
Hi.
No. Tell him to go fuck himself.
Saw it, Dil.
Fuck it, is what I say.
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
Did I?
You heard me --
Jimmy.
It's him, isn't it?
Maybe.
Charming.
It's Dave.
Please, Dil --
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Fuck off back to Essex!
Fucking mad!
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
Fuck off, Dave.
He wants to know do I mean that.
No, of course not, she's a lady.
She's not that either.
Consider it how you like. Just get that bloody tart out of here.
It's a simple question.
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
Your Pat just cost me two hundred quid.
Bloody right I do...
In a way.
Who?
Guy I work with.
What's his name?
What's it to you?
Nothing.
No.
Not English.
Scottish?
How'd you guess?
The accent, I suppose.
And what's it like?
Like treacle.
Who's she?
Don't know. Who is she?
He's Scottish, Col.
Not me.
Must be.
They all get the wrong idea.
Yes, thank you.
What was that all about?
He wants me to perform for him.
You on the game?
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
You can't leave me then, can you?
Half-five. At Millie's.
What look?
They're jealous.
Why?
I wonder.
How special?
You want one?
Jesus.
Yes, please.
Whiskey.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Must be in love to manage that.
Doesn't know the meaning of the word.
Tried to. Sit down, will you?
How different?
Tell me about him.
No.
Shouldn't I go?
Yes.
Are you jealous of him?
Maybe.
That's good...
I think you do.
You say that like a gentleman.
Do I?
Didn't think I could.
Is this an obsession of yours?
He did sometimes.
Did he dance with you?
Want to look after you.
What does that mean?
Something I heard someone say once.
Yeah.
What is this?
Aha.
Depends what it is.
No, depends on nothing.
I'm thinking of your man.
Why?
Told you, I'm superstitious.
No...
Tell him it hurt --
I have to talk to her, Col --
Where?
Sorry, darling.
Give it over, Dil --
Apologies, my sweet.
Do you care, Jimmy?
Sure I do.
You mean that?
Yeah. I care, Dil.
Shut up.
Made me feel all funny inside.
I said stop it.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
You think that's wise?
Nothing's wise.
I know that.
That's a start.
So I'm sorry.
Make it up to me, then.
Will you meet me again?
When?
Whenever. Tonight.
Know what, honey?
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.
So they do know.
All right, they do.
Sorry.
Kind of wish I didn't.
You can always pretend.
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
Are you pretending yet?
I'm working on it.
A little.
Sorry.
Please, Jimmy.
No. Can't pretend that much.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Should have stayed a girl.
Don't be cruel.
Only if you kiss me.
Delirious.
He'd bring me carnations.
So I got it wrong, then.
Not at all, honey.
Don't.
Okay.
Why, honey --
You gonna tell me why?
What's her?
Why shouldn't I be jealous?
Yes.
She from Scotland too?
You could say that.
And you're not going to tell me more?
I'm not sure.
You'd do anything for me?
Afraid so.
No. Sit down.
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
Want to change you to a man, Dil...
It's a secret.
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
And you wouldn't leave me?
No.
You promise?
I promise.
No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes...
What?
Sorry. What you doing?
For me.
For you...
Look on it like a honeymoon.
Told you to stay in the hotel!
Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me.
No! I'm going home...
No! Tell me everything, Jimmy.
Yes.
My pills...
What condition?
Only in times of extreme stress.
I will be.
Jimmy?
What?
Don't go like that.
Your soldier.
You knew my Jody?
Are you listening?
Did you hear me?
In a manner of speaking.
No.
You didn't.
I suppose I tried.
You tried.
Don't you want to kill me?
Got to be somewhere.
Try and go, then.
I like you, DIl
Love me.
Yes.
Tell me you love me.
Whatever you say, Dil.
Love you, Dil.
You do?
Yeah.
I'd do anything for you, Dil.
Never.
It's my name, Dil --
What happened to Jimmy?
Tell me what she wore.
Can't remember...
Do I?
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Not if you go.
Will I see you again?
You will, Dil
I promise.
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
The Metro.
Meet Col --
Yes. Say hello to Col --
What's that supposed to mean?
Carnations.
You know her, Jimmy?
Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
Absolutely. Long as she can keep it. Isn't that right, James...
That's wise, Tommy.
Need to go across the water.
Do you now.
Do you want some food?
Horny bastard.
Did you give him it?
Can't.
Fucking do. I had him all over me.
Someone's got to do it.
My pleasure.
Eddie and Tinker died.
I know.
Yes.
No, what is the thing?
You're never out, Fergus.
Och, you do, Fergie.
Of course. I forgot.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
You know what. Go.
Was I?
Perfect.
And what happens then?
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
You may be right.
Yes?
Who's the old geezer?
Some judge...
I take pride in my work.
I sincerely hope so.
Do you want a cup of tea?
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
Why would you do that?
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
It's your decision.
You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth shut. Go in and get some sleep.
I told him.
Are you all there?
And do you know why?
Why?
What?
Would make me feel better about it.
You sure about that?
I'm sure.
Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.
Who'd you think it was?
I thought it was Dave.
He's at home.
I know that.
Fuck you, too --
And who is she?
Just a girl.
Hope not.
Good. So what do you think?
So it's on the street.
Right.
Kind of suicide, isn't it?
Yeah.
Can't.
Can't eat through a canvas bag.
How is it a farce?
So, what do I look like?
Yeah. And the brown eyes.
My pleasure.
I can smell her perfume.
Can't we take it off?
Nope. Not handsome at all.
You trying to hurt my feelings?
No. It's the truth.
Well, I could say the same about you.
What is it now?
Kill me.
You want to bet?
I'm not a gambling man.
Not in your nature.
What do you know about my nature?
What the fuck do you know about my people?
And you know the funny thing?
I didn't even fancy her.
She's not my type.
No.
My inside pocket.
Why not?
Suppose you could say that.
Don't I know it.
So what were you fucking around for, then?
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
She's a friend of mine
What the fuck were you doing here?
I got sent.
You could have said no.
Can't. Once I signed up.
Why did you sign up?
Best game in the world.
Ever see hurling?
Never.
The fastest.
My pleasure, Jody
Hurry up, would you?
These things take time, Fergus.
Give us a break.
I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you, Fergus.
Yeah?
Don't be so sure.
Jody's always right.
Having a pint in the Rock.
I've often wondered how you do it.
That you guys shouldn't be here.
It's as simple as that?
Yes.
Some kinds of women are...
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
You liked her?
Want you to do something, Fergus.
If they kill me --
Don't think that way.
Take her picture. C'mere.
I told you not to talk that way --
I'm sorry.
How can I?
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
Like the one about the frog?
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
When I was a child...
Yeah?
Tell me something, anything.
Me? No, I'm not good for much...
No.
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
Faster than cricket?
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
What you say, faster?
I said you bastard -- stop --
Got to catch me first --
What?
Hurling --
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
And you know what?
Tell me, Jody
Who gives a fuck.
You never know.
People. They could be looking.
Whatever you say, Jude...
It was fun while it lasted.
Nice lady.
You shut your face --
He believes in the future --
Shut the fuck up, Jude.
That true, Fergus? You in love?
No, we are.
You're crazy --
Give me the fucking shooter!
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
Yes, but --
I think that's what you ordered.
Oh!
What about it?
I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
It's all right -- look.
Why do you think I brought you here?
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
Open up.
Where's that airlines bag?
Lord, you're stubborn.
I sure am. Get it.
Lord, you're stubborn.
Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
Yes, you told me.
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
I know, but this is all we've got left.
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
I'm through listening to you!
Then who did? You're the only one left.
No!
You lied to me so many times --
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
Here, give it to me.
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
I heard you, I heard you.
Then say it.
Reggie -- listen to me --
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late.
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
You mean spies and things like that?
Only we call them agents.
We? You mean you're --?
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
May I have a sandwich, please?
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Yes -- and tell me if you recognize anyone. Just a moment. Have a good look.
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
Oh, I see.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
But I don't have it.
I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.
Thanks very much.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Oh.
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
Describe him.
No, what?
You mean you've known about him all along? Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
But no one actually saw him die.
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
Very good.
1944. The next face, please.
The last one, please.
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
What's your first name today?
Brian.
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
Yes.
But you're -- divorced?
No.
Oh.
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
We wait -- with our mouths shut.
I said with the mouth shut.
Okay -- up there.
Open it.
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
That's the idea.
I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
Or you --  Or you --
I'll take that.
No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
Carson Dyle is dead.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
I met a man with sharp nails.
Come on -- I've got something that stings like crazy.
Would you like to see my passport?
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
There -- you're a new man.
There must be some way.
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Which one are you?
Come here.
I'm not fifteen.
There, you said it.
What are you doing?
Cutting it out.
Who told you to do that?
You did.
But I'm not through complaining yet.
I think I love you, Alex --
That sounds like their problem.
I'll be right there.
Tuesday.
I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
No.
Or Tex?
Maybe.
Why?
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
I'm sorry.
Hm?
I'm scared.
I don't think I know that one.
How often do you go through this little ritual?
I don't believe it.
Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
Why don't you shut up!
Well!
Are you going to listen?
Go on.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
The money is unimportant.
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
In human life? In greed? In suffering?
Forty-five thousand.
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
Why bother him?
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
The kid said --
What do you want?
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
Tell me what?
I'm very cold.
Swiss.
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
He didn't have one.
He was a wealthy man?
About how wealthy would you say?
I don't know.
Where did he keep his money?
I don't know.
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
I don't know.
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
I know.  I'm sorry.
It is all right.
I wish you wouldn't.
One more question. Is this your husband's passport?
And this? And this?
In Mr. Dyle's room?
No -- in my room.
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voil!
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
No, Jean-Louis.
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
Oh no! What man, Jean-Louis --  where?
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
I don't know -- how would I know?
How's that?
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
Sorry. Which view would you like?
I'm Regina Lampert.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Yes.
Good for you.
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
Please, not on my account.
No, you see, I don't really love him.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Yes, but we're divorced.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
Is your husband with you?
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
How do you know?
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
Charles is.
Is there only one Charles Lampert?
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
I don't know where to go.
We'll find you a hotel.
Don't you understand French?
I'm still having trouble with English.
The man and the woman are married --
You mean you and me?
No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
Lay on, MacDuff.
Having a nervous breakdown.
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
I wasn't --
What was it?
What was what?
What your husband was mixed up in.
Where?
Nothing. Good night.
Good night.
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him.
That's all.
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
Of course I'll help -- I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now --
The man you had the fight with.
What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
I believe what he said.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Good night.
Yes?
Wha -- what do you want?
No -- no, I'm don't.
a alors! From Charles?
Because I don't love him.
But that is no reason to get a divorce!
Don't you want me to stay?
He must have known Charles pretty well.
How can you tell?
He's allergic to him.
The American Embassy.
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
What's he up to?
We will separate -- you look over there.
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
He took care of Charlie for us.
Who invited you?
We want that money -- now!
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?
Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
Not my imports.
Don't flatter yourself. You'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me Ben.
I get the imports.
Ok!
Good.
So?
Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
Daddy you scared me!
You're grounded Friday night!
You said that two weeks ago.
Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
I will. Is that all?
What's wrong?
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
How much further?
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
You never went, uh, all the way?
You are upset.
I'm not.
I thought you'd be pleased.
She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.
It can't be.
Who is she Daddy?
No I wasn't.
What did you hear?
Run!
Are you sure?
We're seeing all the signs in town.
She just turned off her light.
She's still a virgin.
Did you warn her?
This will relax her.
She's underage.
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
She's not here.
She works at a church?
A bullet to the right cerebellum.
She was murdered?
I can.
Why?
Daddy....
Who's?
No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen.
What are you doing here?
What?
You gave me a 'D'.
I'm sure you should have failed.
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
You know about that too?
Of course I'm scared.
Then you should go.
I really do. For your own safety.
He's a rapist. Like mine.
You think you're my sister?
Who?
Mark Shale.
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
I was desperate. It was gross.
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
OK. increase the peace.
What party?
Ok.
I won't.
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Follow me.
You heard about that?
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
Why?
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
I'm fine.
I heard you got attacked.
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
I'll think about it.
Yes!
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
I don't know. I kind of am.
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
I'm making you feel like meat?
That's not why we broke up.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
Sharon's far from a slut.
What?
Pretend we're just another couple.
Hi princess.
Mom?
Yes?
You can ask me anything.
Have you ever heard of someone named Lisa Sherman?
Yeah. Who is she?
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
That's what he said.
Did he say anything else about her?
The library. I'll be fine.
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
What?
Two men left town right after it happened.
You're not telling me something.
The principal?
Yes.
Who was the fourth?
Are you Jody?
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
Kenny's aunt?
His mother's side.
His mother's an only child.
Just thinking about something.
What?
I got to go.
What?
I'm worried about someone.
Hi Sandy.
No, you keep one.
So are you.
You're the one who's hand is shaking.
Hide your laptop here.
No.
You can't bring it.
I'm not leaving it here.
Told you to hide it.
But you don't really mean it.
Maybe you better just drive me home.
That wasn't me ...
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
I'm sorry, but you're not going to die a virgin Rod.
You're being unfair.
Unfair?!
Yes. Unfair to me.
ROD!
At least somebody likes this shit.

Would you hurry up, please?
Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.

Yeah, borrowed!
You stole this truck.
You stole this truck!
I did not steal this truck!
You stole this truck! That's...

Hi--!  The gun was empty!
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
You wanna hit me?
And I'm a peaceful man, and...

 Yeah...

I did not steal the truck.
Well, then, that means it's call...

Worth a try.

You're fucked, man.
...stole the truck.
It won't even start half the time.
You know what I'm sayin'?
...truck.
You know.
How wonderful for you.
Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.

Not completely, anyway.
I mean, if that gun was...
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
...-er.  It was your friend...

That is loud!  I'm 
 Whoo!
Hey.   Mason.

Even though it is nice to see Andy...

A-And you  owe me...
...man.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Bring him down!


Are you all right?
No. 

Huh?

We're gonna die!
Arlo, shut up.

We're gonna die!
Hey, hey, hey.


Reach into my pocket.

 Come on!
Oh.
Yeah.
 Okay.

Okay. 

Okay. 

Arlo!


Come on, come on!

Come here.
Go, go, go! 

...-natic.
...to him. 
What?
You got Elvis?!
Sometimes the prey bites back.


Hang...
...on!

Okay.  Okay.
Forty-five seven!
Okay.
  I've got the real thing!
We've got Elvis!
...they come!
And Brynner's right on...
...our ass!
He's comin' up fast!
...here comes the...
...tunnel!
Tunnel.
Whoo!
What do you think I'm doin'?!
What the--?
You've gotta be...
I'm gonna kill him.
 
 What's it say? 
Forty-nine point four.
What?
It's melting, man.



Come on.  Come on.
 
 
What?
It's working.



We got-...
...-ta get outta here!
 Vitelli! Vitelli!

...another way  outta here.    Hey.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sorry.

Let's go!
Go.
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
They'll meet you at the top.
Okay.  Come on, big guy!
Look out.
What'd you come back for?!
Why'd you stay behind?!




We're the shit.  Bigtime.
They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo. 
Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
Who drove the ice cream...
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Who had to put a gun to your head?
Who put the big hurt on...
...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
Hello.
You.
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
I think so too.
 Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Oh, oh!
I feel faint.
Ooh.
That's right.
Hey, be cool.
Be cool.  Be--
That was quick.

...about him.
I'll keep an eye out.
It's for you.
Listen, shithead!
Oh, my God.
...without compunction.
Well, well, well.
Three seconds.  One...

But...
Hey!

So...where's my truck?
I did what I could for you...
Mason, you have to take this...
 ...to Fort McGruder in his truck. 
We do need your truck.
 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
 ...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...

Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.
 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
We've got it...
...on ice!  We've got Elvis on ice!
Us.  Owe us. 
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
...including the permanently extreme.
I'd say we're about even.



Are you crazy?!  Take the boat?!

Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
Any of them Richard Long?
No, sir.
...-tor Long.
And I changed the schedule.
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're...
...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward.
...destroyer of worlds."
No!
No!

You'll kill us all!
Is this stool taken?
No, go--
You look good, Richard.
You look fit...healthy...
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
Grateful?
Mm-hm.
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
"Went away."  I like that.
Almost quaint.
So far, ye-yes.
Forget about him.
...happen if I drop this?
Brynner.
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
Good to see you again, Leo.
I can't say it's a surprise.
And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
And I don't like deviations from plans, Leo, as I'm sure you re-...
...-enworth.  I'll have no compunction at all about using this.
Tell the choppers we're lifting off!

Who's your suspect?
A man named Tim Ma-...

It could be a cover, I suppose.
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
Hey, doc.  Might wanna...
...try this one out some-...
...-time. 
Excellent.

 No, that's not possible, Mason.  The trout... 
...is a perfect hunter.
He's brains without ambition...
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
...the master of his realm.
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
...and that power...
...without caution...

Some people might.
Doc!
Shit!  Oh, shit. 

 No...

God!  They're gonna seal it.

Okay, I'll have a chopper meet you at the top.

Nope.  Is there a prob-...

Just go check the temperature.

Row twenty-three, section C.
Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
That's right.
Can I check one of these volumes out?
I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
I think I gave it to her.
Tell me. What do the police say?
They're calling it an accident.
Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.
Do you know him?
Oh yes.
Where from?
Would you call him a capable man?
Honest?
That's too bad.
Too bad?
Yes, his girlfriend.
Yeah.
No. She's probably scared to death.
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
When was the last time?
What about her?
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
Is she all right?
She's fine.
With her mother.
Yes... I think I can manage...
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
I have no idea. How much do you want?
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
Of course I do. Where are you?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
Either that or she'll be in jail.
What are you talking about?
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
What's that, Curly?
I think I'll kill her.
Call me Jake. Careful driving home, Curly.
Call me Jake. How is everything?
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
Curly, where's your car?
In the garage.
Where's that?
Off the alley.
Could you drive me somewhere?
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
I'll just tell my wife.
Tell her later.
I'll throw that in too.
Okay, you got yourself a boat.
Curly, you know how long I been in business.
That's a filthy habit.
I said okay, Jake.
Thank you...
The apple core club.
How are you, Lou?
Yeah, they are.
How'd you get past the guards?
Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little.
Since I made Lieutenant.
Who?
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
I'd like to talk to him.
You're welcome to try. There he is.
Or her name?
No.
No?
No. It was an accident.
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
When I do, you'll hear about it.
Didn't you call?
Let me show you something.
How did she...  ...happen to have them?
Absolutely.
Too late for what?
They only dump the water at night.
Shut up.  Go on.
Where?
What for?
Tell us about it on the way to Pedro.
Yeah.
Do me a favor, will you, Lou?
I guess not.
Give you three minutes.
Gee, thanks, Lou.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
Yes.
Mr. Gittes.
Well yes.
What are you having?
Iced tea.
Yeah. Fine, thank you.
I said I'll drop it.
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
I don't want to drop it.
Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
Looks like you went quite a distance.
Please call first.
...Just a minute...
You left your keys in the ignition.
Oh... thank you.
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
Well, how much would you like?
My husband.
He told you?
She's cheating on him.
Did you have affairs?
Mr. Gittes.
Did he know?
Where you were when your husband died.
I can't tell you.
You mean you don't know where you were?
I mean I can't tell you.
You were seeing someone, too.
That your maiden name?
Yes... why?
No reason.
No. I'm just a snoop.
I don't believe you.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
More like other people putting their business in my nose.
Another satisfied client's wife.
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
What for? There's nothing more to say.  Get my car, please.
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
Never forgave him for what?
Of course I'm sure.
Know him?
No, I think I'd remember.
What? What is it?
Get in the car.
Why?
I gave everybody the night off.
Easy, it's an innocent question.
No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
When was the last time?
Why?
What were you doing there?
Working for the District Attorney.
Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was...
...No. Why was it.
What about it?
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
...Yes, sort of a birthmark...
Just... I have to.
And I want to know where.
It has to do with my father.
He owns it. You know?
I saw him.
You saw my fa... father? When?
This morning.
You didn't tell me.
There hasn't been a lot of time.
That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
Including the death of your husband?
You bastard.
Then let's go talk to her.
What about?
What does it look like?
Aren't you coming back with me?
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
...That's not what I meant.
Sure.
Upstairs. Why?
I want to see her.
You know any good criminal lawyers?
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
What are you saying?
Katherine?... Katherine who?
She's my daughter.
She's my sister.
Back to Mexico.
I have to go home and get my things.
Where can we go?
...where does Kyo live?
With us.
He didn't wear bifocals.
I'm all right.
Sure, but I'd like to handle it.
He's in the dark room.
Sophie.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
Isn't everybody? What can I do for you, Miss Sessions?
No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
You'll find one of those people.
'Those people?' Miss Sessions.
A Miss Sessions calling.
Who?
Ida Sessions.
Don't know her. Take a number.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
There's just one question.
Of course.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
I wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?
He never even kids about it.
Well, tell him I'll be back.
I don't understand.
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Yes?
Do you know me?
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Have we ever met?
Well, no.
Never?
Never.
Si.
What about the water?
When it comes.
When it comes? What'd you tell him?
So how are you, Morty?
Drowned, too.
Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
It's not completely dry.
Yeah.
Sure you do.
Mr. Gittes...
I'm afraid so.
I am sorry.
...Yes of course.
Then go home and forget about it.
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
Water and Power?
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
He's not in, Mr.?
Gittes.
It's personal. Has he been out long?
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
He did or he didn't?
He owned it.
Yes.
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
Yeah.
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
Let me explain something to you, Walsh. This business requires a certain finesse.
All she needed for that was the phone book!
No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
When I find out who that phony bitch was.
They're all a bunch of phonies.
I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Mortgage Department, First National Bank.
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
That right?... She used to be some looker.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
Well, you never know, do you?
That's for sure.
Why'd she run away?
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
It tastes wonderful!
Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!!  Good thing Germany's closer than Russia.
Progress! It always arrives too late!
That's right, Modern Times.
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
Is there a woman?...Tell me the truth...  There is a woman.
What's she like? What's she like?...
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
Don't think about it, Toto. Don't even try. With feelings, there's nothing to understand.
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
No. And nobody knows where she is.
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
Elena. My name's Elena.
Hi. Why are you running?
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
Bye-bye, Elena.  ...What an idiot! What an idiot! 'Nice day'! Christ!!
But...who...
For what?
That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
Then where's the money?
Somebody stole it.
How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
Where is he?
That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
That's all there is.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
I can't take shorthand.
Get me a typewriter.  I'll finish the notice.
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
I'll write it myself.
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
You don't really think so?
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Yes, very!  Naturally.
Well, well - isn't that nice?
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
Sure, sure.
I'm going back there.
Who else did you see?
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
He made an awful lot of money.
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
That looks pretty nice.
Certainly not.
Certainly not.
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Hello, Bernstein.
Kane?  Charlie?  Where is he?
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
Are they standing for me?
You've got a private office here, haven't you?
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
We've got a nice plant here.
Yes - Mr. Kane.
Is it good?
Yes, Mr. kane.
No, Mr. Kane.
That's Leland, isn't it?
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Has he said when he'll finish?
He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
Emily -
Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
They won't hurt you, darling. Mother's with you!  Mother's looking after you!
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
No, it can't.  Good night, darling.
It may not be about anything at all.
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?
Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
Charlie, please don't -
What's the matter with you?
Toothache.
Hmm!
No.  They've passed on.
In the water.
I know...  But you do look so silly.
On the chiffonier.  Here.
Thanks.
No.  But you're close.
A rooster?
I didn't say.
Is that what you want to do?
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing.
Half past eleven.
I mean in New York.
Half past eleven.
At night?
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
Don't tell me you're sorry.
I'm not sorry.
I'm going to leave you.
Yes.
You can't stop me.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. 
Lock it - and keep it locked.
Yes, sir -
Can't say, sir.
Mrs. Kane liked poetry -
Not my wife - not either of them.
Do you know what that is?
It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
Persia.  It belonged to a king.
I didn't used to be afraid of it.
It's been a tough day.
A wasted day.
Yes?
Yes?
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
I'd like to talk to you about that.
What's wrong, Brad?
I'm drunk.
I'll get you some coffee.
No, that won't help.  Besides, you never get drunk.  I wanted to talk about you and Emily.
Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
You might have made the whole thing less personal!
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
What check?
It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to -
It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
Rawlston is my boss.
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
Right here, Mrs. Kane.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
How do you do, Charles?
Yes, sir.
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
Yes and no.
Well, thanks a lot.
We're leaving tonight.  As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -
Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.
I had a toothache.
What do you mean?
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
I'll have a highball.
I'm not from a newspaper exactly, I -
Am I sure?
Am I sure about what?
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
How long have you been smoking?
What is this, a poll?
What the hell is that?
You think I'm shitting you...
This? How long have you been smoking?
Do you mind if I drink this here?
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
You can hold me down.
Can I join in?
Exactly.
So where is he?
No, this is great.
Can I use the bathroom?
There's no light back there.
Why aren't there any lights?
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
You two better quit it.
I feel nauseous.
No, don't!
Just now.
Dante. You've got a customer.
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
Train. It took eight hours.
I can't believe you're here.
Very dramatic, I thought.
It's not what you think.
Well... kind of, sort of?
No.
Was I right?
I love a macho faade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
There's more, isn't there?
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
But can we date?
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
You're serious. You want to date again.
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
Let me take you out tonight.
You mean, on a date?
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
Sang.
Sang.
He's not invited.
He's your fianc.
You're such an asshole.
I'm just kidding.
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
I'm easy, but I'm not that easy.  See you later, handsome.
I left like an hour ago.
Do you always talk weird after you violate women?
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
Was it you?
I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick!
Call the police.
Then who operated the store?
Nobody. It was closed.
With this guy locked in?
Yeah.
Pack of cigarettes.
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!
How 'bout covering point!? You suck!
I can whip your ass.
Yes.
Hey, neither did ET; but that was a great movie, right?
What's your point?
Peptic ulcer.
Yeah.
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
What responsibility? You're closing the fucking store to play hockey.
I thought Redding had like three balls!
Why are the shutters closed?
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
Bunch of savages in this town.
That's what I said.
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
What smells like shoe polish?
Go open the sore.
I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back.
No, thanks.
You called Caitlin again?
She called me.
Did you tell Veronica?
Eight and a half?
She called me Brad.
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
Great story, isn't it?
That girl was vile to you.
Allan Harris.
Chess team Allan Harris?!
I'm talking to myself here.
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
I think it's safe to say yes.
You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fianc.
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
Return of the Jedi.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
Blasphemy.
All right, Vader's boss...
The Emperor.
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
She's in here?
Each egg has to be perfect.
The quest isn't going well?
I told him that and he yelled at me.
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
The milkmaids.
The milkmaids?
All of them.
Why not?
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
The best Burtless movie ever made.
Can you believe this?!
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
Why'd you apologize?
What?
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
I'm going to miss the game.
Because you buckled.
Sorry.
See? There you go again.
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
At least we're stuck here together.
You've got a customer.
At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
Can we not talk about this?
I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
Then where're we gonna play?
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
Julie Dwyer died.
Yeah, right.
No, I'm serious.
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
Jesus.
I'm gonna go to her wake.
No, you're not.
Why not?
What!?
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
I can't close the store.
Twenty-two; same as us.
An embolism in a pool.
An embarrassing way to die.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
Broke his neck.
That's embarrassing?
Bible truth.
Stop it.
I swear.
Oh, my god.
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
Balls resting on his lips.
He made it, hunhh?
Yeah, but at what a price.
Reach what?
You know.
What, your dick?
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
Her fucking body fell out!
I don't want to talk to you.
Why should I loan you my car?
I want to rent a movie.
You want to rent a movie.
You work in a video store!
May I be blunt with you?
If you must.
Please, get the hell out of here.
I know I'm your hero.
What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
Five hundred dollars.
You're bullshitting.
I don't; you did.
Really?
Holy shit. That girl?
Because I'm here.
You're lying.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
You're happy?
I'm happy.
You're happy to get a fine?
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
I'm not. She just left.
What did she say?
I'm not.
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
What happened to title dictates behavior?
This is my way of spitting water at life.
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
Shut the fuck up!
What time did we go to the funeral?
This life?
Why do I have this life?
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
I should shit or get off the pot.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
What are you talking about?
Leave her out of this.
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
Why do you say that?
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
What time did you get to work today?
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
It's not like I'm miles away.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
Got one. Just pulled up.
Same time. What about you?
To say the least.
Yes.
Just the paper.
Thirty-fire.
I know I can bench more than that!
I don't have love handles.
I'm her sister.
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
No fat, but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise.
How much can you bench?
I don't know.
Yeah.
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
To you?
I... I don't believe this...
'Bout the biggest pair you ever seen! NYNNE!!
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
What's that mean?
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
He died in the bathroom.
We were going to start again, I think.
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
You calling me a liar?
No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
I'm trying.
No, he got hit by a bus.
Oh... Can I help you?
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
I hate this fucking place.
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
Bunch of savages in this town.
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
What were you doing up so late?
What were you doing?
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
Why do you say that?
Really?
I was kidding.
Typically male point of view.
How do you figure?
Something wrong?
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
How many what?
How many girls have you slept with?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
You're a pig.
Why'd you hit me?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
Three?
Three including you.
I'm not the pig you are.
You!
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes.
He gets off on it.
Why do you say that?
Like you said-she snowballed him.
Yeah, right.
I'm serious...
Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
You sucked his dick!
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
How many?
Dante...
Let it go...
HOW MANY?
Something like thirty-six.
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Lower your voice!
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
I'm going to class.
Thirty-seven?!  My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks!
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
I love you. Don't feel sick.
Goodbye, Dante.
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
And that made you feel better?
...it isn't there. Yes.
Thank you for being rational.
Thank you for the lasagne.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
It was only a few times...
Fuck you.
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
It stings a little.
Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about?
What's this?
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
You said you were here all day?
Scumbag. What are you doing?
Check this out, he's from Russia.
Swear.  Olaf, metal!
I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.
You gotta hear him sing.  Olaf, "Berserker!"
Wait, there's more.  Olaf: sing... 
Does he sing in English or Russian?
English.  Come on, "Berserker!" Girls think sexy.
No way!
Feel that.
That's tight. Solid.
I like the way you think.
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
I beg your pardon!
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
You hope what feels good?
Screw you!
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
You're gonna be at John K's party?
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
You're not?
I'm going to have a word with that asshole.
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
I know. I've been here since eleven.
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
Says who?
Twenty bucks.
All right, asshole, you're on.
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
Bye  That was Snowball.
How yo doin', Gabe!
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
Nothing, just tourist souvenirs.
More bang for the buck.
I copy.
Where's the radio?
So, what do you see?
Surprise me.
What usually eats a banana?
A monkey?
Love's a killer, isn't it?
You're getting warmer!
WHEN SHE'S SAFE!
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
The clip's not gonna hold!
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
We'll never know, will we?
Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
Give him the money.
Not on that leg.
Take the gun.
Hi, Gabe.
Fine, I guess...
Is it really four thousand?
One...
Help me!  I don't want to die!
You're not gonna die.  Grab me with your other hand!
Patience my love, patience.
That's a virtue isn't it?
We spent a night there one night...
I don't think you do.
I don't understand?
You couldn't.
Excuse me?
Why are you yelling?
Did I miss something?
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
Which could maybe what?
Maybe lead to a flare up...
A flare up...
Flare up of old emotions...
From one professional to another, of course.
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
And I can't leave.
What if he can't?
What are you doing here!?
Where's Hal, what's going on?
Excuse me?
Don't worry about me, just go.
Making things real rough for Hal.
Of course I do.
It was great.
Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
No, actually it was more like mutual attacking.
Sure, just give it back when you're done.
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
Want me to lead?
Cute.
Breathtaking.
No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
Next time, date only basketball players.
What?
This rope is sixty years old!
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Helluva time for vanity!
Jess, c'mon...
Don't let me fall!
Do it, goddammit!
I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?
I don't know.  I don't know.
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
Oh, good. For a minute I thought you'd lost your mind.
We don't have time to argue about it!
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
I won't do it.  No way.
Take the rope.
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
RUN, DAMMIT!!
And miss all of this peace and quiet?  Never, right Hal?
Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
Never could save a thing.
Now you get burned.
What the hell's going on?
How far?
I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
Anyone else following?
Tucker and Walker.
Tucker and Walker, we've lost three bags.
It looks like a winding route.
There.  You blind?
Hold on, baby, he'll get you.
You're looking at him.
Where's the rest of the team?
Then it's a deal.
Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
These are highly trained agents overreacting without just cause.
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
Why?  What are you going to do?!
The monitor! I never ask twice.
Ask the questions.
You're both with the mountain rescue team?
There, what's that place?
Kill him when he gets down.
What about it?
Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
No names, this is an open line!
Good morning, Walt.
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
I've been cured.
Good evening.
Great, sir. Great.
No, my health doesn't allow it.
And you, sir?
My wife... Alex freezes.
No. She's dead!
Help me, sir?
Help you.
Who are they, sir?
Julian. This will be these people now. Alex gets up.
What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
How do you do, sir?
Hullo.
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
Much better, thank you, sir.
Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
Well, shall we get down to it?
Yes, sir. Rubinstein takes out a notebook.
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
I did, sir.
What crime did you commit.
The accidental killing of a person, sir.
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
No, sir, I feel really great.
Hi, hi, hi there, my little droogies.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
Fine, fine.
Well, how are you then?
Aye. Glad to see you back, lad.
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
You're gonna be sick are you?
I wanna be sick.
You wanna be sick?
Let me get up.
Crime?
Murder, sir.
C of E, sir.
Do you mean Church of England?
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
Brown hair, is it?
Fair hair, sir.
Blue eyes?
Blue eyes, yes, sir.
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
No, sir.
Right. The mothballs, Mister.
Crabs?
No, sir.
Lice?
No, sir.
Through there for a bath.
Yes, sir.
Shut your bleedin' hole!!!
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
Vitamins will it be then?
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
Something like that.
You've heard Beethoven before?
Yes!!!
Fine. Fine.
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
Just part of hospital routine.
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
I hope so. Is that the end then?
I was quite enjoying that.
How many did I get right?
I'm sure it won't be long now.
Father, I have tried, have I not?
You have, my son.
I've done my best, have I not?
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
Prison custody?
Have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness?
Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Carry on, Chief.
Sir.
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.
Are you feeling better?
Four in this block, sir.
Thank you.
What?
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
The ride is free.
You got a deal.
No.  I got lucky with the lights.
No.  You were right, I was wrong...  ...Max.
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
There were two of us.  I had the other guy killed.  Don't need the competition...
Travel...and things.
You psychic?
Yeah.
But not now?
Just had one.
Dozen times a day.
Max...
Max, the cab driver!
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
It doesn't matter!  Just get out of the goddamn building...
In my office?
Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
Yes!  Stay put, goddamn it!  Don't move from that spot...
Yes.
I'm...fine.  Fine.
You sure?  You look pretty shaky...
Right through those doors.  The man himself.
You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
Oh, my, yes.
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
'Fraid so.
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
Sorry?
Can't say that I do.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Take him down.  Save Richard Yip, our witness...
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
I never bought that.
Oh?
Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
Not our call, Phil.
...if they're wrong?!
This isn't our goddamn game!
And you came all the way down here to see me?
Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
What's your name?
Vincent...
Of course!
I've been calling and calling.
I got caught up at work.
What am I gonna do with flowers?
I'm standing right here.
Yesss, you are.  He's artistic.
Vincent.  It was nice to meet you. Visit again?
<u>My hands are taped to the fucking </u> <u>steering wheel!</u>
What happens if you don't?
Who the hell is this?
Tell it to Max.  Tell him he's an asshole.
Jesus, what is with this guy?
Who is this?
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
Max!  Dammit!  <u>Answer!</u>
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
Oh.  Sorry.
Yeah, yeah, sorry...
Twenty-four minutes.
You on some kind of work plan?
You mean like benefits?
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
It's not that kind of job.
You should start a union.
Me, specifically?
Why not?
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
None taken.  There are talkers and doers.  I like doers.
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
You're cool.
No.  You say you're cool.
I'm cool.
With what?
It's just a dead guy.  On three, ready?  Uno.  Dos.  Three.
Yeah.
It's a spasm!  Jesus, Max, don't be such a girl...
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
I tried it.
How about the thingy next to it?
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
What?
It's a mess.
So?
South Central.
How long, you figure?
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
You said you were visiting friends!
Yes.
Play music.
I didn't throw him, he fell.
How can you kill him like that?
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
How?
Believe it.
Good luck.  You think they got families?
I'll deal with it.  I will, I will...
Lenny, my dispatcher.
It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
I need the job.
No you don't.
Next time you pull any shit, I'm gonna kick your fat ass.
I don't understand...
Yes, Max?
Am I collateral?
Jazz.  Music.
I listen to classical.
You mind?  I'm working here.
No.
What you mean, no?
I'm done.  Find another cab.
Leave me alone.
<u>I don't wanna know you!</u>
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
She's in the hospital.
What difference does it make?
Oh, I'm captivated.
You'd do her a favor.
Jazz.
Don't start.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
Doesn't cover everything.
Good excuse.  How many others you got?
Why?
I don't get it.
No.  No way.  I can't do this.
In case he asks.
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
No.
Paid sick leave?
You do impress me, Max.  That you do.
Who?
Who's Heller?
No, not just that.
Yeah, that.
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
It's what I do for a living.
Head towards Union Station.
What's at Union Station?
There you go...!
And you believe me...?
...indifferent.
As in...? 
Vincent?
Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
Let her go.
Who?
Excuse me?
Aren't you listening, man?  Love gives you wings.
Why the hell not?
I, uh, I have some problems.
The guy came right at us!
You turned up a one way street!
Drop me off here!
Look, I'm sorry --
Just drop me off.
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
Not for years.
Well, I -- Jerry, the point.  Get there.  What does it have to do with the President?
I can't promise you anything.
You think I'm crazy.
I think you're different.
You bit someone's nose off?
You're the boss.  Just don't make me repeat myself.  I hate that.
You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
What?
Love.
Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
You saved my life.
Arf... You gotta help me.
I can't promise you anything.
Figure of speech.  Could we go?
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
Change lanes.  Then watch your rearview.
Yeah.
Six months.  Eleven days.
I have no idea.
This would be it?
Are these yours?
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
Who?
Getting rid of my hub!
Has this happened to you before?
Never, but I've been practicing.
Who are you, Jerry?
How is it possible?
That was him.
Is he dead?
How'd he die?
Not this again.
Where'd you get your subscribers?
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
Right here in Manhattan.
You will?
If that's what you want.  Yes.
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
Thanks.
Not today.
Connecticut.
What's in Connecticut?
Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
Come on.
Did you kill him?
Is that what they told you?
Did you kill my father?
I don't understand.
Where were you the day he died?
At a horse show.
Then tell me what happened.
Because he believed me.
You do?
I'm sorry.
Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
You saw me standing alone ...
Without a love of my own.
I can't promise you anything.
Now she tells me.
Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.
That's great.  Good for you.
Then I can't be hurt anymore.
You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
I'm leaning toward no.
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
A dog bit it.
Excuse me?
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
You've asked me that one three times.
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
Excuse me?
The truth shall make you free.
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
And what did I say?
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
I don't believe you.
You do recognize it then?
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
I don't understand.
I want this box rigged with a beacon!
Working.
Working.
Night after that?
Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
Not today...
I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
Wasn't my idea.
Jonas?
Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
Yeah, I do.
I want to believe you, too.
What do you mean?
You think we have time to fool around like this?  Come on.
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
That you come with me.
I don't think so.
There's no plug to pull.
What?
He died...  ... in 1972.
Yes, sir.
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
Dr. Arroway, let me first say --
It's a hoax.  I knew it!
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
Still settling in, really.  Where's Dr. Arroway?
No, thanks.
Oh?  How's he doing?
No doubt.
Ellie...
It's not like you've given me much choice.
The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
Rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise.
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
You mean --
Ellie.
Do you have a minute -- ?
Actually I'm running late --
This... seemed best.
Right.  Well.
Good luck, David.
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
No primer.
How can that be?
VB10's an M dwarf; Signa Draconis... too old.
Put it on speakers.
I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always.
This is how you see the sky?
It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young.
It's a civilian facility.
You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
And a hundred mile airspace.
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
I can't move any smaller.
But what do I say?
Just be yourself, Captain.  Find out where he is.
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
Could we hear God?
Dad... But tell me, how did... I mean how can...?
That's my scientist.
Why did you contact us?
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
The librarian... or the library...?
Now... you go home.
No!  I mean... why so soon?
No.  Please.
Not if you think like a Vegan.
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.
The systems integration site.
Mmm.  Look closer.
Peter Valerian.
Sounds like a Russian general.
Yavol.
'... is indistinguishable from magic.'
What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
We could be together again --
-- I'm moving to Washington.
Greenbank?
I'm serious about this, Peter --
Peter.
You too.
It's really happening.
That you, Valerian?
Like it or not.
Like it.  Almost there.
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
Make that two.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
Spoken like a true believer.
Yes.  Very much.
Prove it.
Some of my best friends are scientists.
Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
I don't think so.
What are you so afraid of, Ellie?
The final countdown.
I'm sorry.
What is it?
What?
I can't do this --
What are you so afraid of?
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
-- I don't know --
Hi.
It was quite a page turner.
I'm not sure it's come to that.
They don't believe me.
I do.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
But I made this arrangement --
Cut that backsass!
It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything about seats. We --
Buck is a deal.
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
What are you doin' here?
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
What went wrong?
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
That's good: he earned it.
Laugh it up, kid. You'll make out.
You steal a car?
He's probably a gigolo.
Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
I... I... I...
Git to work!
Yes, Boss. I got it right.
I know, I know. Just don't hit me.
Yes sir, Boss Paul!
Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
She's got him! You hear that?
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
You jes' watch us!
Borrowin'.
I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
Pair'a nines.
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
I call.
'Bout two hours left.
What happened? How far did you get?
Shut up. Let him eat. Don't pay them no mind, boy.
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.
Get away!
What for?
He's gonna be awright.
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Well, whatta we got here?
A Lucas Jackson.
I just always did like truck rides.
Back at it in the mornin'. Just need a little nap...
Long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
Stop beatin', man. You ain't doin' nobody no good.
That's what you're gonna have to do.
Cool Hand Luke.
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
That's it. That's the end.
Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
Oh, that's mah darlin' Luke. Grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator.
Luke. Where you goin?
On my own.
Thass right. Just play it...
Maybe we oughta call you No-Ears. You don't listen much, do you, boy?
You just said he could eat anything.
You ever eat fifty eggs?
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
You ever see mah boy throw up? Shut your mouth and put up your money!
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
That fool. That damn fool.
Oh mah baby Luke.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Bet! Babalugats, bet here!
Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
Gettin' up, Carr.
Call.
I know he's got a paira kings. He don't have to stick 'em in my ear.
Damn.
Kick a buck.
A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?
This is a big day for the guards. They get to remind us who's boss.
What are you talking about?
Give in? That's our Luke out there.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
Only kidding!
A little homeopathic cure for the willies.
He whispered, but it was <u>him</u>!  I know it was him!
When was the last time you washed your hair?
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  And guess what else?
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
You <u>slut</u>!  No sexy young cop for you unless you shampoo your hair.
Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out.
But </u>alive</u>!
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
The same as the first time...
He told me he had done two others just like it.
When he was seventeen.
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
She's supposed to have it.
She don't want it.
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
Oh, I think you will.
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
Where it began -- McCluskey Auditorium.
No.  Not yet.
Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm in charge here.
That's an opinion, not evidence...
Who?
Because of your phone calls.
What calls?  I haven't made any calls.
Would you want to work with us on this?
For months... last October.
He felt remorse.  He covered her.
How did you know they were stockings?
It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
I want a guard on you.  I'm worried about leaving you alone.
That's no surprise.
But it's a different m.o.
Then what do you need me for?
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
Because I'm all you've got.
What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
They weren't going to show it to me?!  The arrogance!  It's my <u>life</u>!
Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
In the sixties.  He's dead -- stabbed to death in prison.
He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.
MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
Not yet.
No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe. I'll fix it...
I'll get a locksmith.
Yes.  I have to go...
She on the passenger side?
<u>What</u>?...
Why don't you shoot off the lock?
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
Who prescribes the brandy?
Lieutenant  Quinn.
Because it's your job, that's all.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
You're shitting ion your career.  You outrank hi...
Yeah.  And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
Just horseshit luck.
Don't ever forget how good you are.
Classy madonna.
Honest to God, Ruben!
I like women like that!
Why would he send this to Helen Hudson...
My promise.
Look at him, grandstanding...
The woman's unstable.  You could wind up with a harassment charge. <u>Anything</u>.  You're like some horny little teenager.
I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day.
Shut up.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
Would you step outside, Sergeant?
That's always your privilege, sir.
Helen Hudson...
Because I think I'm wrong.
How'd you get in on the deal?
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
Nikko?
You know I don't like to watch talk shows by myself.  Where're you?
We were interrupted. I had to go back to the set...
Thank you.
Outside in the visitors, car park.
What!? They brought the car here?
It is?
No, I couldn't. I feel too close to her.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
Do you find him attractive?
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
No. But when he's in that car...
I'd better come with you, then. Are you sure you can drive?
My last lesson's next week.  James... my car...
One of my suitors.
I'd like to go back. James...
Not yet. It's only beginning.
They said it was here. They told me this morning.
Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
I work in the immigration department there.
Isn't that rather too close...?
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
I can drive.
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
Yes.
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
You could get your wish at any moment.
It's hospital policy...
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
Yeah, and a dimple.
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
Patient.
What?
I want to see my mother immediately.
We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
I miss Beast a lot, too.
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
What?
I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
There's nothing to tell.
Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
Yeah, it'll be fun.
She said she'd be here at 10.
I'd have to see it on.
But everything's OK?
What about the engagement party?
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
You look beautiful.
What's the matter?
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
It'll be fine.
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
Ecru.
Oh, no, of course not.
I didn't say...
I ruined your wedding night.
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
But what am I going to do?
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Will you get time off to do that?
Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
Wow.   Congratulations.
You've only known Jake a few months.
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
Oh, Letty, what happened?
I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
Ruth's already taken him home.
You too, Mom.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
When did you start smoking?
And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
It's good exercise, Mom.
A deal's a deal.
I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
There's a spider in my room.
Mottled really.   Green and red.
I understand you just got engaged. Maybe that's where we should start.
It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
I guess so. I think that's right.
I answered these questions last night.
It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
Terrific.
What if it's got a pattern?
That must be really difficult.
You took bets on my diagnosis?
It's no big deal.   We all compare.
I'm not the one who's masquerading as a doctor. I'm not the one who's, who's...
Anything interesting.
I've already checked it out 17 times.
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
Very romantic setting.
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
So are you engaged, or what?
Enough with the abracadabra.
Guess.
The left one.
OK, OK, I'll give it back.
A small price.
Exactly.
No rounds for another three hours.
Rendezvous at the closet in 30.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
A rose is a rose.
Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
Really?    Me too.
What's my rap?
I wish I could have seen that.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
No way.
How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
Tell the doctor.
I don't like lamb.
Lie down.
Your family just met me.
I do.
Michael, I...
But I do.     I love you, too.
Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
Home free.
So there were no problems?
Not a one.
And did you go to the mission?
So, it's over?
List schmist. You'll remember.
Open up.    I want to see.
You like it?
Do you like it?
I love your apartment.
Really?
Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
You're so wrong.
It's sex time.
Shhhh.
I'll be forced to tickle you.
You, too. Kick ass today.
Yeah?
Yeah.    How was the job search?
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
You got wine. That's great.
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
I think I should go home.
Big restaurant interview tomorrow.
The restaurant, too?
I couldn't even face that one.
You don't have to take care of me, you know.
I got worried. Are you OK?
Congratulations.
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
Bingo.
It wasn't exactly a lie.
Always the drugs.
What?
We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad.
Michael, take it easy.
Silly, silly, silly.
I think I should call someone.
Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
I guess so.
It's hard to know where to start.
And all the plans we have.
Yeah, the plans.
I don't know. I don't fucking know.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
Oh, God, Michael, I know.  Why does everything have to be so hard?
What do you want to do?
I will. And you make sure you take care of yourself.
You should go.
She's only known the guy a few months.
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
The receptionist said you called earlier about something.
Good going. I knew you could do it.
Won't it be hard for them to get a substitute this late?
No, it's not like that.
Can you loan me a 20?
Sure. Why?
I'm going to the store.
I think you're overreacting.
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
That's a big question.
I hope it wasn't something I did.
Something you did?
I think we need to talk about some things.
Especially now.
So, I've been thinking a lot...
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
So, what do you say, Let?
So will you?
I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
Who?
It doesn't matter who.
Have you been seeing another teacher?
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
I start on Monday.
I heard about your friend.
What?
I'm really sorry.
I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
I'll float you.
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
Simulated sapphires. I bet my daughter would love those, too.
That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do.
Do you know who this is?
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
You'll never get out of the city.
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
They left about a half hour ago.
Where did they go?
I dunno.
What?   This?
It's Elvis...
Who?
It's me...
Oui.
Should I call you back?
Oui.
It's Daniel.
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
I'm not here to negotiate.
Why are you here?
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
You want me to help you get out of the country?
And the other half?
I only have your word for that.
You have something for me?
What kind of business?
We can't.
She probably hid it at her place.    The six of us could find it in --
I'm not any closer than you are.
I'm just setting my boundaries.
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
No one? Then why is Zero here?
And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
You want Zero to kill him?
I'm going to kill him myself!
What about the money?
And the Vodka.
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
I thought they came with batteries.
I can't believe you didn't check.
We'll think of something.
I think he's already figured that out.
Everyone get some sleep.    We're leaving in the morning.
You're sure?
I just want to live long enough to get back to Paris. Just long enough to kill Bastaldi.
Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
I'll be Elvis and you--
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
Has to be.
No?
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
What'd you get?
Some bread and...
Can I trust you, Sami?
You better.
Guns.   Can you get them?
Man, I can get anything.
Don't bullshit me.
A thousand dollars?
Fine.
It's me.
-- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good at it.
Hector, don't interrupt me.
French guys?    You mean like from France?
Yeah, French guys from France.
What'd they take?
Everything.
Everything?
Everything.
Boy, you must be pissed.
Okay boss.
Great fuckin' song.
What room number?
I don't know.     I didn't look.
Go look.
Go where?   The police are outside.
Oh, then we will have the house wine.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
What is it you do, Sami?
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
Okay.    I will have a beer.
That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
I'm the driver.
I've never driven a Cadillac before.
I'm not going to leave you.
We both know I'm already dead.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.
Yeah, I can see that.
I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
It's my idea.
Okay.   You can be Elvis.
No, that's not Mr. Taylor.
Give it to me, Sami.
No!
Just tell me who's closer to the wall?
They sort of got away.
No.   It's mine.
The hell it is.
Fuck me?   Fuck you!
Uh huh.
I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
You see that car?
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
No thank you.
I know where she went.
Oh, you think?
What?
J&amp;B?
Glenmorangie is very good.
And you don't speak French?
How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
You wanna tell him?
I don't know.
Tonight.
Take a nap.
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
Something like that.
Did she break your heart?
Something like that.
You got it in a bar?
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
The lucky ones.
No.
It's not your fault.
Stick around and find out.
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy does.
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
I'll go and make up his room!
I didn't have the heart.
Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.
Why were you spying on the Yus?
Then leave her to me.
What's it to you?
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
Real sharpness comes without effort.
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
Tell me, who is your master?
Let's go!
You're already a thief.
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
Yes, you do!  You are still my disciple.
So what if I don't?
He is my defeated foe!
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
Don't invite danger into your father's house.
Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
I have a guest.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
You're a sword fighter too?
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
What do you think?
How so?
I'm bored.
I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
About you and Li Mu Bai?
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
I'll give them to you.
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Come and get it if you can.
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
Not another lecture!  On guard!
Let's end this here.
Only the sword will settle this.
What I've always wanted, to teach you.
Kneel!
Never!
Jen!
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
I don't take orders from anyone.
Give it back.
I am a man.  And now I've found the brightest star of all.
It is trouble for me.
Jen...
Don't ever come back.
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Make a wish, Lo.
It has.  How's business?
Good.  And how are you?
Fine.
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
So what will you do now?
But something is going on at the Yu household.
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
No, not yet...
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
Well, we had talked...
She needs direction... and training.
It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
Save your strength.
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
I heard Sir Te lost something.  And now Madame Te's not feeling well...
I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...
We must avenge mother!
What does it say?
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
But the sword could be in his compound.
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
Who ever made that.
Care for a hot dog?
You buying?
I'm buying.
They make you fart.
Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
Don't thank me.
Thanks, babe.
No further.  I'm serious.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus change...
My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
It's only a flesh wound.
It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.
How 'bout the morgue?
No.  I have one more thing to do.
We'll discuss this later. Obviously.  You left the door open.
It can't rain all the time.
Mister Funboy.
Mister Funboy lives there?
Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"  It used to be her favorite.
No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
No.
I have to go.
A remembrance.  A closure.
In a better place.  I hope.
You're not gonna come back, are you?
You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
Well, how's your friend?
Mom tried to cook.
Oh.
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
I need to find him kind of soon, Elly.
Victims.  Aren't we all.
Take the dope, too.
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
Wrong answer.
Another jolly nickname?
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
I know.  That is why I will prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?
Interested?  Follow the crow.
Miss her?
Yes.
Leave me alone -- !
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
You work for the dead.  Forget that, and you can forget it all.
Maybe I was wrong about you.
I'm already alone.
Very well, it's your ass.
Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
18k.  Crap.
...necklace... pearls...
Leather purse...
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
Is he inside?
Move in, guys.
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
Annette Harrison.
I don't think so.
Did you know Sebastian well?
You might say that.
I'll be fine.
Excuse me?
You heard me.
You what?
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
On my mother's life.
Okay...
Got a boyfriend back home?
No.
Why not?
No.
I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
How do you know I've been with several women?
You talking to me?
The Fountainhead.
Great book.
You've read The Fountainhead?
That's a matter of opinion.
You need help.
Give me the fucking letter.
Refreshing.
You implied it.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
Because you act like a pig.
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
You don't find me cute? Come on, look at these muscles.
Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
No thank you.
How are you today?
Give it up.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
That's none of your business.
How about tonight?
I'm busy.
Doing what?
That's also none of your business.
It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
How was your date?
It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.
Okay?
What are you doing?
Reading.
Of Human Bondage.
Somerset Maugham.
You're not gonna start that again.
I will.
Need any company?
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
What?
I do.
No?
Not at all. Have a seat.
You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
Why are you doing this?
Because I'm in love with you.
Why can't we be together?
Yes.
Where are you going?
Good for you.
Get off me.
Hi.
Hi.
Yeah, me neither.
Why aren't you understanding?
I love you.
What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
Schwarz. Jewish?
German.
Doesn't ring a bell.
- none taken -
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
The football stud?
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
Absolutely.
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
Those are my letters!
Do you want to learn or not?
I guess. It still sounds gross.
It was nothing.
Eyes closed.
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
Is it that obvious?
Well do you like him?
I don't know.
Did you hide the letters?
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
It's Kathryn.
What do you mean?!
I... I don't think you want to know.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
Well what then?
Well did you like it?
I did?
Cecile, everybody does it. It's just that nobody talks about it.
That's one way of looking at it.
How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
But I thought high school is only four years.
It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
You think he'll like it?
He'll love it.
Just taking your photo.
I want to go home.
I was just kidding.
I want to go home.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
Of course. I'm not a monster.
I swear.
You promised to let me kiss you.
Some other time, Cecile.
For the first time, yes. It'll pass.
No, you were fine.
I'm taking a shower.
No.
Want a blow job?
Good night Cecile.
Prude.
Don't you want to change that?
Yummy.
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Honey, is something wrong?
You don't know him. I'm so stupid.
Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
Baby?  Right on time.
Get out of here.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
I swear on my life, I never said a word to her about you.
I'm pretty sure she did.
Pretty sure or sure sure?
She bought it.
I'll be in touch.
Who is this?
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
Where is she?!
Likewise I'm sure.
Ronald?
Yeah?
It's Kathryn.
No.
What do you mean?
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
I'll think about it...
Could you be more desperate to read it?
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
Because I'm the only person you can't control and it kills you.
Even there?
It would feel so yummy.
Loser.
Blow me.
Call me later.
Okay.
Shhh.
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
Oh sis. You're so tense.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Any day now.
Cecile.
Who are you spying on?
Take a look for yourself.
Yeah.
What's your problem?
Nothing.
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
Morning.
Exactly the opposite.
Kind of.
Oh yes.
Tell me all the details.
It was... Fantastic.
Oh come on. For her first time?
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
Excuse me?
I'm not in the mood.
And that's why you're leaving?
It clearly is why.
I want to fuck.
And I don't.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
I've never done this before.
Screening calls. Any suggestions?
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
You wanted an answer to your question.
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
Thank you. Now, where were we?
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
Will you calm down?
Fine! Get off me!
I accept. Now get out.
Get out? We had an arrangement.
Didn't you hear what I said?
War it is.
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
Not at all. What's wrong?
It's Cecile.
What about her?
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
You will be discreet about this?
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
It's the least I can do.
I've already told you, she's not home.
Well please leave a message that I called.
I need to talk to Annette.
She's not here.
Do you know where she is?
She's out.
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
It's really important.
I understand. Good night.
I did?
We played backgammon?
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
Excuse me?
Oh... no thank you...
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
Nope.
Don't worry about it.
She really loves me.
Can we do it later. I've had a really bad night and -
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
Did you hit her?
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
Don't know what I'm talking about? I know that you fucked Cecile.
You bastard!
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
But quite harmless, I'm sure.
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
Yes, darling.
Did you ever make a wish?
Oh, lots of times.
Did your wishes ever come true?
At the old house with the voice.
On the back street  a green house
The Farren house
Do you know the people?
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
But it's already come true.
Sh! Then you must keep it true. Goodnight, darling.
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
What's her name?
Irena.
Irena.
I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
I know that.
Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
I forgot I had it on.
It's early yet.
No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
That's right.
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
Well, it seemed to me --
You're shouting at me.
I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
What?
It's your play.
Well, you know where it is.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
I live right here.
Maybe I'll drop in and see your Mommy.
You'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.
Did you mail then?
Yes, I did.
Where did you mail them?
I'll show you.
Yes, daddy.
Certain wishes do.
It was on account of the birthday party.
It was just a voice.
Let me be the judge of that.
This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
Yes, Amy?
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
Don't you see her?...Right there, under the tree.
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
I don't know yet.
Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
You called me by my name.
Irena. But who are you?
I'm your friend.
I've wanted a friend.
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
But where do you come from?
I can not tell you.
Will you be friend for always?
For as long as you'll let me.
I shall want you for always.
Whenever you want.
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
The numbers simply don't mean anything
That's right!
My dolls. We can pretend.
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
Oh, thank you, Amy.
A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
It stands so still.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
Don't cry, Amy.
But she's dead!
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
But, Amy!  Amy...I'm dead.
Yes, Amy.
But why?
That's a fine-looking ring.
A lady threw it to me.
Soon as I finish.
But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
But what happened to the little deer?
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
But it was alive  it was fast and strong!
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
Why hasn't he got a head?
Don't you hear it?
Don't you read Shakespeare?
Yes, yes -
Anybody could know that song.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
It was pale...a shadowed gold.
Good night...Barbara...
Now, I don't know Amy --
That's from her -- that woman.

Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
Can we get some service here?
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
Your lips look delicious.
I've been working out.
At Victoria's Secret.
I mean where on your body?
Oh, on my wrist.
No, it was another woman.
Good. Except for PMS.
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
How have you been feeling?
No it's mom.
Mom!
What does that have to do with me?
Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
Anything's better than Mark.
My shrink says he's not so bad.
I'd kill for just a little bloated.
Only to see.
Can't you get contacts?
Try to get through dinner without them. You have beautiful eyes.
Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
Frida, grab that red one.
And she got the medium.
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
And he was ripped limb from limb?
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
Why would they exaggerate?
Did I kill him? Of course not!
No, did you fuck him?
No. I don't think so.
And my bra finally fits again.
Uh huh... good thing those cops didn't see that.
I wonder if he's married.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
Frida, I'm your friend. I'm not judging you... You didn't sleep with the creep did you?
I looked like an Italian man!
I think he called you beautiful.
It is so hot in here.
No you don't, believe me.
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him.
I put it down the garbage disposal.
And what makes you think you killed a man?
I haven't gotten it yet.
I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
Tuesday. Are you okay?
Shit, I guess I missed work.
Frida, Carlton's dead.
Oh no.
And he was missing an arm.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
Okay, I gotta go.
Did you get rid of Mark?
Yeah, I guess. Mark?
Why not? There's been a murder.
You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
Why the fuck would you do that?
I could smell another woman on him.
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
No.
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
So what do I do?
Fall in love.
I think I already have.
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
No. I won't let you do that.
About Mark? Carlton?
About Benito.
Frida? You okay?
So you're Grant's secretary?
I do development for TV movies.
That's great. Highly original.
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
They say sex is great for cramps.
Well I have it worse than cramps. Goodnight Gregory.
You should have gone at the restaurant.
My apartment's just such a mess.
Knock what off?
You don't have to pee.
So pee? Here?
Since when do you care?
You never say that.
Oh my god, I'm sorry!
I can't help it, it smells so good.
Frida, you know you're it for me.
Yeah right... You better go.
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
This really isn't a good time.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
Take your shower.
On your desk.
Script coverage?
On your desk.
Coffee and...
Your desk.
Did you change your hair?
A little.
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
No?
Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
Are you following me?
At least let me give you this back. I washed it.
So what book did you buy?
Oh, it's nothing.
I can forgive you a bestseller.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
No, she died when I was twelve.
The weird thing is I've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since.
Goodnight.
I'm sorry -- I'm on edge today.
No. Nope, nothing in it.
A man killed in Central Park.
Uh... the buzzer's broken. I'll be down in a second.
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
What happened?
Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
What's that supposed to mean?
I love you too.
They do? Oh no...
No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
Peter I love you too but...
I don't think you'll hurt me.
I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
Thanks.
I don't know. I don't remember doing it.
Oh my god, what happened?
No, I said it was our first date.
No, I have a cat.
How big?
She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
Tell her I'm eating.
You can't believe this bullshit.
Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
We can just take this pillowcase.
He's been running money for the Mafia.
You're some catch Lloyd.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
I checked all the zoos. No missing animals. You think a pitbull?
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
And you think I'm sick?
And he was missing an arm.
We only live a few blocks apart.
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
This one walk you home too?
One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
What of?
Maybe ten minutes...  Thats strange.
Spinning backwards?
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
His wife.
Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
No one available.
How will we interrogate them?
Well, sir...  I don't know exactly.
He tried to kill me!
Shut up!  Everybody stay calm...
Just visiting my patient.
Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
Just like that?
I'm afraid so.
Yes.  This way.
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
A hunch.  He might be able to...
Ill be the judge of that.  Anything else?
Sorry, sir.
I didnt requisition a secretary.
The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
Wrong?  Look at this!
<u>Fine</u>?  Look here!
Im sorry...
Well be more careful, please.
Shut-up.
I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there.
Who?
Why are they after you?
Don't know that either.
Don't know much, do you?
What?
It sure isn't the fun-fair.
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
What?  Who has?
What is that door?
Which one?
No.  Have a look.
Yes.
It must be a closet or something.
But I...
I see.  The verdict, yes...
Wait, this isn't fair...
Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
You seem restless.
Then we must call the police.
Shut up!
You know something about me?
That's what people keep telling me.
Yes.
Tell me about them...
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
That's right.  I <u>am</u> your doctor.
Well...
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
Anything <u>but</u>, my friend.
I have to go...
No, it's the truth.
Nothing.  I don't know anything!
I'm...  being...  punished.
We are...  living in their dreams...
How do you know I'm innocent?
That's easy.  You...
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
Right.
What?
Is this dangerous or anything?
No more than the usual.
The usual...
You're kidding?
Don't worry.
Don't worry about it.
A month.
Right and don't embellish.
I promise.  I won't.
Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?
I mean,  if it's a problem...
What the hell is this ?
No...
) Listen, you little...
Great.
Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.
Yeah.
Fine...
Fine.
I know.
... What?
Just don't call him, Alan!
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
I don't give a shit.
Bob...
TilT we figure something out.
Bob, the guy had a stroke!
Soon.
Exactly. A condition.
Yes.
I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
Clean.
Check his kids.
Clean.
Nobody's got clean kids.
We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
Oh.  Excuse me.
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.
Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
I don't think so.
I'm going to kill him.
You can't kill a President.
He's only doing what you told him to.
What I told him to?
I'll lock him away for good.
Then we'll all go to jail together.
Just what you think I mean.
Are you threatening me?
Sort of... Yeah.
Dave -- I'm working.
I was gonna do something with Joan.
Oh. Okay.  I'll catch ya tomorrow then.
They could put you in jail.
Why would they do that.  They hired me.
This is undeclared income.
And who's gonna find out?
The government
I am the government.
Well -- take care.
Extend them.  C'mere for a second.
Oh, yeah... probably...
I'm afraid so.
Really?   Crazy?
In the car.
I see what you mean.
What?
I don't think so.
Oh.
What?
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
Fine.
What?
Quick.  Gimme a quarter.
Right.  We can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
Wrong...
Alan...
She knows.
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
Fertility beads.
Ah.
What do you mean?
I just fired Bob Alexander.
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
Yeah.
Yeah... Sometimes they do.
You know.  Your first campaign.
Oh... Kinda the same way.
No.
What?
We'd like to hire you.
Really?
Oh.
You got a gun?
Of course.
No.
But it's ten-thirty at night.
I had a feeling.
`Bleed for your king.'
No... They don't kid.
Oh, sure.  Don't worry about it.
The Vice-President...
Well...
No thanks.  It's not that far.
Uh...
Go tuck yourself, Bill.
I'm outta here.
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
You made their funding disappear!
Mind if I sit down?
Anybody would have done it.
You weren't in the state legislature.
Home.
You1re leaving, too?
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
Truman used it all the time.
Thanks.
It's just so strange...
What?
I guess.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
You find people jobs?
Yeah.  Is that funny?
Well don't get carried away -- I'm not that good at it.
It was inspirational.
Yeah... Bedtime.
I can't.
I know. I'm sorry...
What?
Hi.
Yeah, well... It's finally over.
I missed...
... Me, too.
Yeah... It could be fun.
Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel...
What about the intro?
It better be.   Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.
The tunnel.
Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on.
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
MISS HENRIED, SHUT THE HELL UP!!!
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you.
What?
We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.
He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two crates. Can you get me into the hospital?
What?
I got some fuel comin' out and, I hope, some automatic rifles.
Come on!
You are dying, too.
PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.
God....damn you, Rhodes!
Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
My..."detail", sir. We're going to bury the heads.
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
Sir!
No, sir.
Let me see your weapon.
In the battle, sir.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
What'dya get?
I'm alright. Let's go.
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
To fucking Mutt.
Don't come.
So don't goddam come!  Please.
They're townies?!
Yeah!  Tell him off!  It couldn't get any worse.
What is the Dead Poets Society?
Come on.  It'll help you get Chris.
Women swoon!
But why?
Yeah.
Well?
So?
I'll tell you later.
How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.
Except sex.
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
This is it.
Oh come on, Pitts...
I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
I couldn't stop myself.
So much the better.
Isn't he precious?
I think you're sweet.
Doing fine, sir.
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
That's not my fault.
Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!
I'm in.
My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it.  The sax is more sonorous.
It's Nuwanda.
Nuwanda, what is going on?
Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
I'm one of the proofers.  I slipped the article in.
What happened?
Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda.
What good will that do?
It's better than doing nothing.
It's not all right.  Come on, Dad
Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin.
You know,
Chet...
Knox?!
Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
The pleasure is mine.
Ridgeway High.  How's Henley Hall, Gin?
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
You are?  She's glad I called!
But, Chris...
Huh?
You can't be in here.
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
Then come with me.
Knox, you are so infuriating!
What is that?
My Word
It's just for a little while. You promised.
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
Very good, Mr._?
Meeks.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
A barbaric yawp.
Yawp!
Again!  Louder!
YAWP!
LOUDER!
AHHHHHH!
Excellent!  Have him act.  Give it rhythm!
I have something.
I was just looking in an old annual and...
Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
Not if you're going to stay true to yourself.
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
I don't know.
What I have to do.  Screw the annual.
She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry.  Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
Nothing.  No mention of it.
Then you can help him.
I'm sorry, Neil.
But father, it's not fair.
Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
But different.
Where is this cave he's talking about?
Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
Forget it, Pitts, you're coming.  Meeks, your grades hurting too?
What is it?
The god of the cave.
My brother went here.
Oh, so you're that Anderson.
I'll take him over mine.
What?
Nothing.
I... I just don't want to come.
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
I don't want to read.
What?
Found what?
A play, dummy.
They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
From my father and Nolan.
Neil, you're not gonna...
Quiet.  I have to think.
It's my birthday.
It is?  Happy Birthday.  You get anything?
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
I will be with thee straight.
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
Put more into it!
YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
Do you have to quit the play?
Yes.
We have to make it to the third deck...
He's the owner...
Why don't you want a message sent?
We're going to die here! We're going to die!
Us...I'm talking about us... We're the fish.
And where is our point of arrival?
Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
Who asked any?
How soon can we get up and running?
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
You're going to have to get a new one.
Then you better start swimming.
Dead.
Shut up!
I told you...
With who?
That's where my boat's moored.
It ain't any better out there!
I saved your life is what I did!
The thieves.
I'm not a thief.
Then who are you?
I'm their ride.
What are you people talking about?
He's with them.
Jesus Christ lady...
What are those things?
I don't know...
You people...rich people...
I'm not rich people.
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
Thank you, I work at it...
Seen a lot of islands?
Quite a few.
Self sufficient...
Takes one to know one.
On the side!!
Yeah you did...
Right... You have a boat.
The "come back" kind.
How do you know that?
Takes one to know one.
You're saying they can think?
I'm saying they're calling the shots...
The quiet...
A meat locker.
We can't just leave them here.
You should talk...
What?
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
And what if I run into one of those things?
Soon as I get over the heart attack...
I don't take orders at all.
This time, make an exception.
He's not coming...
You ain't giving the orders here!
Forget them...
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
I'm flying blind here God damn it!
I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones...
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
I'm stuck...
I don't know...you got what we need?
That way.
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
Seafood salad.  You ever operate a jet ski?
And what have you come up with?
How does an island sound to you?
One whistle... Start the engine...
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
Where is everybody?
Poolside?
Nowhere...
You want some too?
Like Mamooli's country...
Plans don't change...
Nothing.
Someone's back there.
Hey! Come out here!
Hey! You hear me? Come out!
Shut up!
She fucked me.
She fucked me too.
She fucked you?
She fucked me too.
Yeah.
Fucking women, man...
I know...
Those are mine!
You want 'em?
Damn right!
Gimme a Hostess Twinkie, Merle.

Good... Pass the beer.
Get the boots.
I mean let's get going before --
Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
Who's going?
We're all going.

No women?
Hey! Fuckin' A!

Couple of weeks... Listen --

You mean...?
Worse since she talked to who?
Yeah.
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
Sure. Why not.
Where? Where is he?
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
What hospital is he in? Where?
He doesn't want people bugging him, Nick!
But you must come in.
No, I --
But I insist.
I have to go.
You are frightened, no?
Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
You are his friend.

Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!

Inside, Vince.
Sit down. Here. Right here.  Albert! Vince!
Not so good.
No?
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
Kind of. You didn't know?
Sal's alive???
Nick, she won't say why.
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
Here.
Biederman, yes.
Linda, what's the matter?
Oh... You know...
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
Will you marry me?
Okay.
I don't know.
Give her Miller's. Miller's High Life.
Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Nick. It's okay... It's okay.  I have to go now.
Right here.
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
You're going hunting?
What?
I see you're going hunting.
I don't know.
Hey. Look. There must be something.
C'mon. I've got the car.
I... No. You do this for money?
We... Three bullets.
And then you...
Who the hell knows!
No. No, no.
I want to go home, Merle.
Right here.
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
That way it sets.
Yeah.
Huh?
You do?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Fucking A.
What do you think about?
Yeah.  When it comes to hunting, that's true.
From Nam?
Pow.
Pow?
Oh.
Hell no!
Yeah.
Promise! You gotta promise!
It's ahead, Vince.
Huh?
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
Hunt with Vince?
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
What else?
I thought you might be praying.
I'm doing that too.
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
What do you think?
Okay, okay!  Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
What do you mean?
We what?
Three bullets -- minimum.
No way. No fucking way!
YOU'RE CRAZY!!!... NO WAY!... NOW YOU'RE CRAZY!!! YOU'RE COMPLETELY CRAZY!!!
Nick!... I thought you went home.
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?
You wanna bet?
How much? How much do you wanna bet?
Watch it, shithead!
Here! This is it!
No.
No!!!?
What do you mean, no???
That's it. No. No way.
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
You guys are crazy. You know that? I mean you guys are really nuts.
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
That's my plan.
See you Monday.
Nick. Hey. How's things?
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
What's that noise?
What?
What's that noise?
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
Great. Hey. That's great.
Listen, Nick --
What?
We do, Sal. We do... You're the heart.
I know. It's like coming from the moon. Or Mars.
Yeah.
Did you get one?
No.
You didn't get a deer?
Here. Behind you.
Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
Yeah.
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat.
Aw, it's a long story!
That's who.
What's it for??
No!
Never one.
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
Yeah.
The fuck I did!!!
The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!
Up ribbon!
Down ribbon!
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
Wade's here.
Wade did a little reminiscing.
I'd think about it.
Avon Lady!
No, you're not model material.  Anything else?
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
I want to see my wife and kid.
Later.  I want Doucet first.
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
When you bring in Doucet.
I'm going to kill you when this is all over.
Out of the room.
And I want Doucet.
We have to talk.
What are you talking about?
He could be brought back.
Forget it.  Stick to the program.
I'm thrilled beyond belief.
What the hell are you talking about?
You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
How do I look?
Aces.
Shut up!  Drop it.
I got it.  I got it.
You sure?  I can help you.
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
Nobody's looking.
Go in the house.
Not the 'T' word.
Ooops, I forgot.
Yes.
But Sergeant...
Commissioner Gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.
Technothugs.
How do you know?
Some things never change.
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
I'm not fond of television comedies.
My insurance won't cover it.
Pass.
Yes.
Relax, let technology do the work.
You can't catch this man with a computer.
I was set up.
Yeah.  Least I think so.  Twenty- six years this March.
I'll be okay.
Good night, Wade.
Good night.
Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
Hey, I'm eating.
You want to be a good detective?
Then find me some cigarettes.
That cost me two weeks' pay.
Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
No, sir.
<u>Comwatch Dispatch System</u>.  Can't assimilate voice stress.  Code priority only.
How ya feeling?
How do I look?
We're partners, aren't we?
I'm here.
You treat her nice.
...What are you talking about...?
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
Hospital food.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
You be careful.
I'm signing off.
No you don't.
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
What's it mean?
You never want to find out.
Take a look at this.
But he was such a good cop.
They always are.
Yeah.
Seat's too high.
My mom says I'm gonna grow.
My granddad was a policeman.
What's your name?
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
Good to know you, Willy.
Remember, get the seat fixed.
Hi.
This little thing says I can't.
You could always take it off.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.
From over the mountain --
No -- that's for me to do.
No, Jabez -- your place is with your wife --
Of course I will.
The -- folks or people, what's the difference among friends?
Thank you, Belle --
You're lying.
Lying to you -- Why should I?
You know that you're in my house.
All right, Daniel. Jump in.
And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
No! No! I won't.
That's just too bad --
Howdy, Hank.
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
No. She's gone.
She couldn't be gone!
Belle.
Belle --
-- in gold.
Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
You are afraid!
Afraid ... of what?
-- of what happens after we die!
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
Don't say that -- I know it is --
All right -- so it's buried with you!
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
I do -- and I think you should too.
Look here now--
Leave your tongue off of that!
I'm through with you.
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
Ten throws it is.
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
Well -- I'll be -- if it isn't little Mary Sampson from Franklin.
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Well, I --
Shall we?
Morning, Jabez.
Headache -- Squire?
Well? Don't a politician have to be?
Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
How much?
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
Coming.
Oh, Jabez.
We can still use my butter money.
Your butter money?
Do you think I'm grudging it?
Mary -- it's gone.
Not all of it?
If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
To save us work on the spring plowing?
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.
Jabez ...
Mary -- what would you do?
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
Looks right elegant, Mary.
Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
Worried!
Jabez --
Thanks, Mary.
Oh -- Jabez.
I'm serious.
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
And I don't want to have a washwoman for a wife.
Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son.
I am going to lock him up.
You're not supposed to punish my son, Mary.
It shows on your face.
I don't know, Jabez.
What's the matter with 'em? Why don't they come?
Jabez!
All right, Jabez ...
Mary!
Hard luck -- like me.
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
Well ... make him keep quiet.
Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
What's that you say, Son?
I say -- it don't matter.
You'll be a father any minute now.
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
The law is the law. Good-bye, Mary.
And you didn't get it, hey? Come on, we'll have another talk with him.
Very well, folks. I accept.
Coming, Ma.
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --
Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us.
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
I'll do my best, Mary.
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
Hullooo!
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
Pretty good -- that's perfect!
Scratch will do for the evening. May I -- join you?
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
You can talk to me ...
I can't be honest with them.
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
Mind if I play some tunes?
That is Christmas music.
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
Not any more.
No, sir.
John.
Tell me about it.
What does he want?
The guy upstairs who's fucking things up?  I can give him to you.
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
I don't want neutral...I want dead --
Who said we were terrorists?
Who are you, then?
Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?
Only if New Jersey counts.
New York...
Put it down now.
Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.
'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now you are fucked.
Then don't waste time talking to me.
Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
Gennero.  Miss Gennero.
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
Don't I always?
Holly Gennero?
Yeah.  How'd you know?
I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
Uh, what do I call you?
The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
I'm here, cowboy.
You don't want to know.
I...I shot a kid.
I still feel like shit.
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
Yessir.
No.  I never smile any more.
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
Come on, what's under this?
What about the kids?
Jackie - what are you talking about?
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
Well, how'll I get home?
Yeah.  A lot of guns.
Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
Oh, yeah, I will...
I love you.
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
Hello, Sonny.
How are you doing?
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
Ooohh....
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
I'm really shakey.
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
Yeah.  So how are you?
That's it.
You're really crazy.
I know!
Where you gonna go?
I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped!
I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
I like that... yeah!
Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
I know I am.  I know!
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
You don't have a choice?
Look... don't throw that on me.
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
Do you still want the operation?
Yeah... yeah.
It's my only chance!
Right.  See you sometime.
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
Who's this?
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
You alone, or you got confederates?
I'm not alone.
How many you got in there?
I got Sal.
Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?
What do you want to know that for?
Sonny-boy, one word?
Call me whatever you want.
You frisk me.
Right -- I'm with you, buddy.
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
Calm down... look at this, look at him...!
It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
The girl hostages.
Sonny, come on out!
You tryin' to fuck me?
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
Don't fuck with me ...
There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need?  How else can we help you?
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
We're bringing in your wife...
He's all doped up.
I want to talk to him.
Why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street?
He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.
If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him!
Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
I can take care of that.
Come on, lemme load you up...
My side, shit!
Gimme the keys to get outta here!
Give me the keys...
You're goin' outside with me.  If there's no cops around, we just split.  Otherwise, you go with us.
Sal, get 'em in the vault.
Mulvaney...
I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
If you take anybody, please take me.
You like me?
Sure - we like you.
Yeah.
Why not?
I don't think so.
Yeah?
Are you a lawyer?
No.  I had some legal training, but...
I want to dictate my will.  I need a notary?
What now, Sonny?
Everything's all right?  You okay?
Yeah, just a cigarette got in a wastebasket.
I'm glad it's okay.
It's okay. [Regards to the family, Sam.]
Howard!
What about Howard?
You were terrific, too!
Hey.  It's raining.
It was on the TV.
No, not until after they killed him.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
I used to, but I stopped.
You stopped?  Why?
Because I don't want cancer.
You shouldn't start now.
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
Yes...
Let's go, Sonny.
Yeah - it's all right... let's go.
Get 'em in the vault!
How'd that happen?
What?
I want him to think that.
But do you mean it?
But I want to know what you think.
Dead or alive?
Alive.
All right ... send them the guard.
All right ... let's go.
Does that still go?
We're not there yet.
Yeah ...
Everybody!  Back here!
Have him walk in backwards.
They gotta stop sayin' that.
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
Okay.
All right. 
I'm here.
No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
Okay, when do I get them?
I want to talk to Leon.
I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.
It's my mother.  Who needs this shit?
Gimme the black guy...
We'll have hamburgers on the plane. You ready?
I am.
Open this up!
Come on, nobody's going to the bathroom - come on...
Those bastards -- they poisoned the pizza!  Sal - you didn't eat any pizza!?
They're beautiful ...
Sonny - Here's your document.
Yeah - it looks real official.
Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
What'll you do?  Come out.
Did Pop come down?
Doing what?
Robbing a bank.
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.
<i>$300,000.</i>
<i>Morning.</i>
<i>That's the crew. They follow us.</i>
<i>Are you all right?</i>
<i>Chinga te y tu mama tambien.</i>

Domino. Do you have a last name... Domino?
Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.
Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.
Oh my God... you mean... the two of you dated?!
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
There are no bond certificates.
What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?
No. What's the big deal?
Something is going down. Something bad.

Do you know where Danang is?

We can't lose focus of Domino's journey, Mark.

I don't know how he does it.
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.

Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.
You listening to me?
You really think so?
So what do you want me to do?
And that's exactly what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Vito, get a broom and sweep out front.
Here, take the broom.  The front needs sweeping.
Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
That's gonna be the last time you hit Vito.

Actually we have something for you.
Yeah, I think.
She's saying... a beautiful swan...
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
... flying gracefully... over the rice fields.
... to the tune of "Only the Lonely" by Roy Orbison.
Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.
In the new library there.
You're the kid who was home schooled.
Yeah. How'd you know?
Heddo Jeth-ica.
Yes, you and the whole Special Needs class.
A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
Come over around seven.
O'clock?
Yeah...
Gotcha.
Would you like something to drink?
Yeah, but I'm buying.
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
Very good. Back in a jiff.
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
Coming.
Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat!
Well la de da.
Famous? I've never heard of it.
I don't follow.
You know Mom, like in the pool.
I know I am, Mom.
Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
Is it okay if he spends the night?
LLOYD, did you ask your parents?
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
So boys, how was your first day?
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
Home school? What's that?
I go to school where I live.
Is that what I think it is?
No, it's a treasure map.
Cool.
You're it.
No no no no no.
Why not?
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
Shift to your left.
The principal.
Wow.
Oh, is this your special place?
Oh, of course.
You brave soldier.
JESSICA? Please hold for my reaction.
Go fish.
Just a guy I hang out with.
Exactly! A pirate!
What?
She did not.
You're not my real dad.
Shut Up! Buttlick!
Where did you learn that word?
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
Shut up Lloyd. You're not married yet.
Now you see why he was elected principal?
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
I didn't know that.
Welcome to public school, my friend.
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
Oh! Ho! Okay. You wanna go?
And my mouph is frozen.
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
Yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure.
How do you know it's for us?
Wanna bet?
Who's your partner?
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.
You can't marry my mom.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
I don't think so.
You're always your harshest critic.
Yes.
You have beautiful eyes.
Hey, where did you come from?
I bet you want your head scratched.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible.
HARRY!
Go away, assface.
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
Captain Rob came back?
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
You wouldn't get it. Just a private joke between best friends.
Me, me, me!
The answer is George Jefferson.
Nothing. Why, whaddya hear?
A blimp.
A turd.
Who?
Hello, he only invented money!
What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".
Yeah, that's why I asked.
You certainly did.
Sorry, no further questions.
Am not.
Are, too.
D2.
No. Look.
That must be her boyfriend's car.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
I lugged it all over town!
I made the polar bear pants.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
I... found that rock.
It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
I don't know who we are anymore.
Maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it. Put it on.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
Right. She's so proud of her boyfriend.
Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.
LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want.
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
Roger that, Wilco.
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
And with that complete loser
I don't think that'll happen. We've learned a valuable lesson we won't ever forget.
Damn! What are the odds?
What?
That's the one I wanted.
Try one in a million!
Well, what should we do?
Hey, where'd you go?
I know.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
Oh, you're good.
I wouldn't know. Being that I'm just the teacher and all.
Oh I think you do.
One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.
TURK, leave him alone.  You're coming too.
Special Needs class.
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
I'll talk to you later.
If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
Do you want me to pet your head?
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
Tomorrow night?
Oh, go on.
That's it. I'm done.
No, it was a complete waste of time.
Looks like the best man won.
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
Duh. I'm in your class at school.
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
You really are a pirate.
Can you believe it?
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
What are you talking about?
Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.
That's the downside. There is none.
Do we have a deal?
Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars.
Uh-oh. Harry?
He passed away three years ago.
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
Hey can be on top?
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
Have you got what I want?
Oh yeah, give it to me.
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
Museum huh, haven't been there since my husband left me. I love art.
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
Uh, no and I don't appreciate...turn down here!
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
Yes you are. 
But we don't drink from the house do we.
And I you.
Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
Oh wow. Look at you.
Wow, you are smart.
And you are great in bed.
Who's there?
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
What?
It's a surprise.
Everything. Just for the record.
Just like the President.
The evidence of what?
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
Are you going to kill her?
Piter.
You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!
This is my son, Paul.
They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.
With your permission...
Nothing.
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
We are alone...
Yes?... How was your journey?
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
Sire!
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
Not sorry enough.
They said you were dead.  They said...
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
No, but many consider my training valuable.
I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
Excellent!
 Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...
I can't... I can't.
Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
Yes...
No.
Always.
Why do they come?
Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
The most lethal poison in the Universe.
Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.
Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
Long live the fighters!
Pain.
SILENCE... SILENCE.
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
What is it?
MOTHER! Tell me!
Did they try and fail?
They tried and died.
SILENCE!
I'd know the difference.
My father sent you to test me. Music then?
Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure.
It is my home.
Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
Huh?
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
Don't you bave a car?
Certainly.  But now the children of the night are calling me.
Do you want me to get it for you?
No thank you, Eddie.  I'll be alright.
Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
Ah, so I pull the strings!
Huh?!  Oh yeah, of course.
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
Dracula?
I gotta type this up, while it's still fresh!
I didn't feel well...
Let me take you to the hospital.
No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
Nah.  This happens all the time...
"Beg to differ.  This casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --"
I never said I could ad-lib...
So how'd we do?
We didn't make a dime.
Mmph?  Where am I?
You're shooting "Bride Of The Atom." Scene 85.
"Dear, you're lovely."  "Strap her to the table."
Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.
Yeah, I did.
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Don't let me slow you down.
Alright!  Let's put it on film. CAMERA!  SOUND!
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
I was thinking about killing myself.
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
Don't worry.  Everything's gonna be all right.
Eddie, how was I?
Perfect.
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
I know none of <u>my</u> wives would've.
No problem.  I know it by heart...
I don't know.  Where?
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
If you say so.
Rolling.
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
What's to protect?  It was perfect!
Rolling.
Sound!
What do you mean?
Nothin'!  I told him he was great.
NO!  It has to be UNDERWATER!
And who may you be?
Edward Wood, Sir.
H-how'd you know?!
I'm Criswell.  I know all.
I don't understand.
I made it up.  It's horseshit!
Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
My pleasure.  I'm always happy to assist in a little larceny.
We'll do our best.
What?
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
No!  A horror movie star!
Boris Karloff!?
Close!  The <u>other</u> one!
You met Basil Rathbone!
It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
Oh, just like in the script!
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
Say it a little louder.  I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer.
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
Like <u>what</u>?!
The secretary.  Or the file clerk.
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
Does she have room for me?
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
Hey, <u>the movie's getting made</u>. That's the main thing.
Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.
But you used to say --
I understand you just moved here?
Yes.  Hollywood is oh so exciting.
What other sixty-thousand?
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
I can't wait to take a look.  So what's up next?
Lugosi's washed-up.  What else you got?
Hruphh...?
You could say that --
Absolutely!  You see this script..?
<u>Lugosi</u>??!  Didn't be pass on?
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
Yes?
Da pleasure be mine.
Oh, of course!
Tor!
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
I think you're quite handsome.
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
Nah, that doesn't matter!  It's a visual medium.
Bela, he talk.  Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk.
Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
Don't worry.  We're almost there.
We're escaping!
Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
I got married last night.
Oh.  Congratulations.
The marriage already ended.
Oh.  My condolences.
This is my thirteenth pair.
Oh, hi.
You look beat.
I am.  How's your father?
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
I just picked them up on the way over...
They're very nice.  Let me get my coat.
"Dracula."
No! I love sex with girls.
Okay?
STOP!
Bela died.
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
The sun.
Yeah...  I should give her a call.
Who's Dr. Tom?
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
C'mon!  Let's just go.
Let's get married.
Huh?!
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
What's uncanny?
LOOK AT HIS SKULL!
Well it looks good.  Let's use it!
You're <u>sure</u>???
YES!  JUST DO IT!
You know, to make the legs move --
Great!  Bring 'em in!  Bunny, I gotta run.
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
Are you IN5ANE?  <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
What if I'm vomiting?
Do they show it?
No! Do they show you having sex?
Anything good?
Who?
They celebrated the common person.
Al!
Yes!
What?!
What?
Okay, I'm nuts.
So?
She doesn't give a shit about him.
You know what would be great?
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
You know it.
Good idea.  Could you all leave us alone for a few minutes?
What if Shari's the dream?
Ed, do you want my advice?
Yes?
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
I ... don't know. I ...
Al!
We're falling behind.
Tell me.
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something?
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
What?
Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
So he killed himself.
Oh.
Yeah?
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
Send him away.
He made a mistake.
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
I mean, that worked out.
Oh my God!!
I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
Could've been a nurse?
She had white shoes.
Mom?
What's the matter?!
St. Joseph's.
To you? In front of him?  With the...
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
Why? How...
But Al is your husband now!
Apparently, neither can Hank. What the hell did you do to him?
Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.
No, I understand. That's - where is she, is she all right?
No.
What is she, at work?
She left.
Well, when will she be back?
She wouldn't tell me.
All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
Our what?
Our foibles, our foibles!
No, I mean...
Never would be plenty.
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
You batted or you bunted?
Dynamite.
So?
Dynamite is dangerous.
Okay ...
Yeah.
It's... okay
Well, when you put it that way.
Can't we just --
Go!
I missed you.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
Saturday, I think we should
What?
Shari, I really like you...
I really like you too...
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
... yeah, then, but...
So...?
Everybody hates me!
No. Who?
Look at this.
Ohh...
Really? 
Ed?
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
Come on, let's go.
Where?
Somewhere.
Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
Come on...
Are you all right?
No. It's your fault.
Where were you?
Show business.
You're in show business?
Yeah. I service video equipment.
I'm making a tape.
We're excited.
Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom.
Yeah?!
Yeah.
Oh, Jesus.
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
"Quick pull off the highway" is not a relationship. Oh man, I gotta pee.
It's me, Ed.
You watching the ballgame?
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
We'd better go...
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
You brought the cameras here!
You brought the girl!
Please!
Yeah.
Look, we gotta talk.
Save it.
Ray, come an--
Who's Shari?
Who's --
I love you! 1 want to marry you!
No. Am I supposed to?
It's Ed.
The whole time? Eighteen years?
No. Two times.
What...
Check forging.
Oh, man! So...
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
The pirate ship.
No. Ray sat on it. I'11 see you.
Hi.
No.
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
Good?
Mm.
Ed?
Yeah. Why?
What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
By the X. That's were two lines cross -- forming an X.
Tu
pierdes.
El/ella -
pierde.
She's incredible.  Everything just gets soaked.
I'm not talking about ethics.  I'm talking about morals.
Everything's fine.  Just, you know, school.
He likes it.
Yeah, uh, just a minute
Do it!
You guys have fun?
What?
You're going to Catholic school next year.  You're going to Sacred Heart. Maybe they'll straighten you out!
All right.  I'll be back
Larry, we're not electing the fucking Pope here. Just tell me who won.
Yeah?
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
You know what they say about the early bird.
Thanks, Mr. M.
Tracy.
Oh.  There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know.
NO, that's fine
You bet.
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.
Hello, Tracy.
I'm looking at new cars.
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Uh-huh.
Yes?
Why are you doing this?
Doing what?
I've got an idea.
My house.
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
I just have to get something. I'll be right back.
Take as much room as you want
I hope so
You will.
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Even tried you at home.  We've got a situation here.
Hmm?
Walt needs to see you.
Oh.  Okay.
Just wait outside. Tammy.
Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
And when did you do it?
This weekend.
Exactly when?
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
And how did you get in the school?
Which door?
I have proof.
Okay.  Give me the drill.
points at the motel.
Oh.
No, I... uh, didn't know that
Still clear?
Yep.
Three twenty-five.
You're there.
Yeah.  I'm here.
Sherry... I love you.
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
I was lonely.  You took advantage
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
No, wait -- apples.  Apples.
If you say so.
I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
I'm not like you.
What...?
What?
I don't care.
Well, I do.
Sorry.
It's a conflict of interest.  And Paul was first.
For what?
It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
Oh, no, hey.  Like I said. Tammy wouldn't... she...
Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy
What do you mean?
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Sure, Tracy.
Thanks.  You too.  It was great working with you.
What'd I do?
What's it to you?
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
That obvious, huh?
It's practically stamped on your forehead.
It's not what you think.
Yeah, plain scotch.
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
How'd she meet Patchett?
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
It's Lynn.
You say 'fuck' a lot.
You fuck for money.
Do you enjoy it?
When they deserve it.
Did they deserve it today?
I'm not sure.
But you did it anyway.
Yeah.  But not for long.
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
In the morning.
Call me Dudley.
Doing what?  Mowing your fucking lawn?
Of course... But how?
How what, Wendell?
You've got it, Wendell.
I got to write my report first.
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
Five minutes.  That's all.
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
Maybe.  I don't know.
Look at a picture for me.
No!  Please leave!
Yeah.  A great big one.
Officer White, put down that weapon and --
It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard.
Lynn.
She told you?
Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.
What?
Which one are you and which one am I?
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
What about him?
Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
I spent years trying not to live down to mine. 
I'm not asking you.
I don't know him.  Mr...
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
I ain't your <u>paesano</u>, you wop cocksucker.
More's gonna cost you.
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
Susan Lefferts.
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
What do you mean?
And I'll promote you.  You'll be a lieutenant immediately.
Until he gunned down six people.
Nothing.
I don't have time.  I have --
Just show me where they are!
Say what and so what.
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
Dogs got no reason to live.
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
Man, what're you saying?
Ray, we got the shotguns.
I don't own no shotguns.
They shot him in his library.
It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
What does that have to do --
And what?
He runs call girls.  Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars.
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
I was thinking Detective Bureau.
Answer yes or no.
I... No.
So be it.
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
I'll break them, sir.
Anonymous.  Probably nothing.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
Something like that.
I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.
That's right.
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
<u>Shit</u>.  Someone beat us here.
What?
Just don't shoot me.
Even I'm not that crazy.
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
You make a mistake?
Yeah.  My whole life.
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
It's a simple question.
I want to do it right.
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
What?
She <u>is</u> Lana Turner.
Great.  You get the girl, I get the coroner.
I get the idea.  You got a description?
Of his penis, sir?
Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
What's her name?
Lynn Bracken.
Why's she seeing Bud White?
Why do men and women usually see each other?
Not good enough.
Why?
The way you've underestimated Bud White?
You sound like you mean it.
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
You, me and White, huh?
Actually, Bud's only tough on the outside.
Where is he?
Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
A sweet man.
Under the house.
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
Sid, how are they hanging?
Down around my ankles.
You tight with the D.A., trash?
Around.
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
What's wrong, Trash?
What happened with the kid and Loew?
A bootleg...
Yeah.
It'll be our secret.
Showbiz.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
Oh?  Anyplace else?
Working whores with squad two.
Oh Jesus.
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
<u>They</u> said he was behind an extortion scheme.
What'd he say to you?
What'd he give to you?
Nothing.
I'm telling you, I--
Nothing. Two nights later I was robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.
Who are you calling?!
I don't know what that means.
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
Clear as day.
When can you get it here?
I'm doing a transfer now.
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
I'll come straight there.
Be careful, Danny.
Rachel Banks?
I don't know who he is.
Yes.
Who was that other guy?
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
That's who they are.
The NSA?
Yes.
You're crazy.
Okay.
Wait.
It's a SAT-tracker.
I don't know what that means.
I don't know what that--
No shit.
I'll pay you.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
What do you mean?
I mean did you call anyone.
Look, my wife is understandably--
Jesus!
I called my wife!
What'd I tell you?
I didn't use my name.
What'd I tell you?
I called from a payphone!
What'd I tell you?
You told me no calls.
I told you no calls.
None of your business.
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
I was a traffic analyst.
How'd you get around the tap orders?
Looks like Detroit.
It really is.  Did you find anything?
Yeah.  Take a walk with me.
The NSA killed him.
Jesus. Do you have proof?
They're here.
Who?
Them.
Where?
Here?
<u>Here</u>?!
They shouldn't have come without calling first.
You sure?
You're driving.
Those are Feds.
Oh my God...
That wasn't so hard.
Fuckin-A.
Yeah, I can see where that'd--
Tell me about it.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Drive.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
Goddammit--
Same thing?
So what do we do now?
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
What if <u>what</u>?
What if we just fucked with 'em?
No.
Who?
No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert.
Not particularly, no.
Is Jerry Delsano in?
Who's calling?
My name's Neil. Maybe I can help you.
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Are you sure about this?
Neil, thank you for your help.
Hello. Hello, Maria.
You got any money?
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
I'm married.
That's fine.
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
Can you help me?
How 'bout Christian Dior?
Is that good?
Very good.
I'll say.
What size?
What size?
Eight.  Size eight.
I'll be right back.
Thanks.
Remain calm.
Okay.
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
For that matter, I think you will too.
<u>What's</u> your point.
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
The robbery.
A police report.
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
About the accident.
What kind of trouble.
You tell me.
I can't.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
I'm not his attorney.
Than why can't you tell me.
Because I don't know.
Somebody took my blender.
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
No.
Anything at all?
No, sir.
Was he with anyone?
Not that I could see.
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
No.
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
To buy lingerie.
For your wife?
Listen to him.
You should take this seriously.
What?
I saw a man die.
What do you mean?
Yeah.
Who did you work with to get the--
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
Sorry.
It's okay.
He's got his priorities?
Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm <u>hearing</u> of--
It's not true.
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
Oh, please--
I think you should leave now, Robert.
Leave this house.
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
Was that doctored-up, too?
My father's put me in touch with an attorney. He'll be--
Just reporters.
This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
Well...yeah.
Good.
Stacy--
That's okay.
The lingerie.
I was missing you.
What is it?
Oh Christ.
Yeah.
That's gonna end tonight.
It's over.
Albert's gonna get me my job back.
I'm sorry about Rachel.
It's a brand new card.
Here, you can use this.
Sir?
My suitcase is gone.
I don't believe it is, no.
Why the hell would I--
It's not?
You don't know who the fuck--
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one.
I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
Oh.
It tastes like fish.
It is fish.
Not that much.
Brill.
Never.
It's how he works.
Brill?
Yes.
So you've said.
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
Other than me.
Why would I--
How can I be sure.
I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
You got a minute?
I gotta go.
Will you hang on just a second.
For the last four years.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
Bullshit.
Rachel--
We're screwed.
I'm gonna fix it.
How?
Tell me about Brill.
You have to.
I've never met him?
Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
This conversation's over.
What makes you think it's you?
It's not me?
You're a moron, you know that?
We believe he did.
You're wrong.
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
Fuck you. You may have to what?
--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
We'd rather not--
Fuck you. You may have to--
Shut the fuck up.
Gimme the shoe.
You're Brill.
Brill.
Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
Fuck off.
Where's Stacy?
What are you talking--
Some of 'em.
Can I open 'em up?
Sure, go ahead.
Really?
In your dreams.
You staying for dinner?
Where's mom?
She's in the kitchen.
Where've you been?
I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.
No "900" numbers.
No.
Usually they take clothes.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
I love my blender.
They didn't take the silverware?
No, but they took my blender.
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
They only took electrical appliances.
Serve the ball.
Into what?
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Christ!
Ssh!
Bobby--
They killed Rachel.
Rachel's dead?
Yes.
They're framing me.
Why would they--
I don't know. I mean--
Why would the NSA--
You're tired.
Jerry--
Listen to me.
You gotta--
Go to 'em, Jerry.
I have a family.
So do I!
No. No, it's okay.
Yeah?
Turn yourself in.
Jerry?
Yeah?
Go fuck yourself.
It's been a few years.
Tell me about it.
Are you okay?
Are you still in Crystal City?
Yeah, what's going on?
Yeah.
What does that have to do with you?
I honestly don't know.
I don't know.
Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
Yes. But we can't.
Why not?
Then what's your goddam opinion?
It means who's side are you on?
What?
I said fuck you.
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
What about the tapes?
We found the originals.
The originals?
There was a transfer.
Am I to understand--
Get it.
Help from whom?  Christ.
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
Yes sir.
You're kidding me.
No sir.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
So they know everything.
If they've looked at the video.
Oh, let's assume that they have.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
We don't know.
Explain that.
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
Federal Express?
How'd you get in the building?
The door was open, sir. I just need a signature.
Puffed cheese?
No thank you.
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
Then let's assume I don't.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Hello!  Good morning.
Which stall?
Excuse me?
I don't want to go back.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
I don't care to bargain.
That insults them.
Excuse me?
As the wife of one of our party.
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
Pardon?
You sing.  All the time.
I do not.
We took several photographs, there's no need.
I'd like you to have them.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
See what's happening to them - the stars.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
Shall we be all right?
Yes.  Absolutely.
No, the marriage isn't a fiction.
No, but I think I do.
No.
Will you please come in?
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
Don't.
Good.
You sew very badly.
You don't sew at all!
Now.
When were you least happy?
Now.
A lie.  What do you hate most?
Ownership.  Being owned.  When you leave, you should forget me.
What?  No!
This is empty, just coming!
Arabic?
You bastard, I was believing you!
Yes.  Yes.  Absolutely.
I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
No.
I can't move.  I can't get out.
A surprise, he said.
We've got to get you out of here.
It hurts too much.
I know, darling, I'm sorry.
What?
Yes.  Absolutely.
Oh dear.
Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
I know.
Still a car.
You too.  Good luck!
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
What?
It's Geoffrey under this.
I haven't, no.  Sorry.
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
Almsy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
Her hands and feet were tied.
What did you do?
In my room.
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
May God make safety your companion.
Okay.
Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
I don't know.
You are a Canadian spy working for the Allies.  Code-name Moose.
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
A nurse?  Well, sure, a nurse is great. A nurse?  Great.
Or was it Toronto?
Don't cut me.  Come on.
Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
Are you Hana?
What do you want?
Yeah, for a while.
So was my Patient.
Where've you been?
Rabbit hunting.
Ask him.
What?  How could he have?  When?
I liberated it.
I think that's called looting.
I can get in the back.
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
Oh, all over.
Are you planning to be the exception?
I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.
Top Hat.
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
The rest meant nothing to me.
No, now I can't kill you.
Oh really?
Lady H said she thought you might be -
I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
I won't hear of it.  None of us will.
Very much so.  We are all, save my friend here.
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
Candaulesyou're laughing at me.
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
Yes.  Dropping off.
How?  How can you see anything?
I can see my wife in that view.
Are you remembering more?
Could I have a cigarette?
Are you crazy?
He's Canadian.
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
Yes?
Thank you.  Thank you.
Really?  That's sudden.
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
I've been told that before.
Kip's another one.
- to her cooking.
You'd better be.
Would you like me to?
Never heard of it.
Hana, I know you do!
I love you.
I don't think so.
Yes, for your hair.
You get Hardy.
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
Don't talk.  Check again.  Lie flat and then cut.
Yes.  Later.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
Nya-nya-nya!
I mean home.  India.
Kip I -
I'll always go back to that church.
So one day we'll meet.
It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
And what if he really is a spy?
No.  He's - no.
Oh God.  Oh God.
Hello miss.
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
Pardon me?
Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.
We can do that when we're very, very old.
I was looking forward to this evening.
I had a hotel room.
Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops. 
Yessir.
Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
Why not?
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
What's he saying?
No.
Or my wife's.
Then you were married?
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
I don't recall asking your permission.
The windows don't open.
Bingo.
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
Yeah. Me.
Why didn't I think of that?
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
Which you have in mind.
We're getting close.
How close?
I don't know, but close.
I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.
I'm in the middle.
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
Who am I?
That is of no interest.
Uh. I'm showing off.
I can't?
It's sold.
How about if you try disappearing.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
I have a proposal for you.
Uh, yes.
Meet me in front. Five minutes.
I'll call an ambulance.
You're joking.  You can't trust anyone these days.
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
I sincerely hope so.
Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously.
So alive.
No. Why would I be?
Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
Not a word.
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
That's my girl.
Give him the card.
But--
Can you follow simple directions?
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
Not funny.
Got it.
We're only going one way.
Certainly not mine. Come on.
I'm a thief. Sue me.
Where's my bag?
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
What's my problem? You want a list?
Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could.
<u>I'm</u> dressed.
Good morning.
Nice spot.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
That's when we'll do it. And we'll need every single day.
We're doing this together. We're partners.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
No, dammit! I mean me! That Rembrandt...that Rembrandt!
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
It was perfect.
This isn't a good time to hear your personal philosophy.
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.
We are...for the tools.
Try laps. Say a hundred.
Our equipment has arrived.
Hmmm.
Yes you did.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
The lipstick thermal camera?
Charged. Receiver?
One more item--not on the check list.
It's---beautiful.
Thank you.
It's not a village. There's nothing there.
I've got something for you.
Little celebration before we set off.
To our...partnership.
I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
Popup, on floorboards. And--
It's a party.
Let's mingle a little, shall we?
You're not on the beat.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
You can't be too careful.
Ready.
Got it.
Behind you.
Shut up.
The Mask.
Yes. Yes.
It's your mistake.
The big job.
There is no big job.
Get the hell in.
You don't know the half of it.
Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
It's fifty-fifty, less the cost of the dress.
Everything.
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
I'd taken the Mask?
My job, my rules.
You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
Right. The eight billion.
Where the money is.
It's no good without the argon gas.
You've thought of everything.
We're doing it tonight.
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
Like a woman of mystery.
Charged.
Parachute.
Packed.
No. You'll see when we get inside.
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
Call it a new tradition.
It was wrong to deceive you.
But that's all behind us now.
Have really held you under?
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
Oh, I don't care about the money.
Four billion dollars.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
That's because you grew up rich.
What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
They'll each be positive the other guy did it.  I fear an ugly international incident.
FUCKING THING!!!
The disc is still in there.
We can't help it, we...we've gotta...
I sincerely hope not.
You can do it.
No way.
Go!
Get out of here!
No, you can't.
I'm not leaving without you.
Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.
You mean the seven billion.
Always in a rush.
In the van.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
The key to success is using the right tools.
It's never big enough.
Because I never assume anything.
This better be worth 1t.
It better be worth it for me.
How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
The early bird gets the damn worm.
But the second mouse gets the cheese.
Remind me why.
Because it pays off.
We're supposed to.
Suspicious, after all these years?
You change partners, you change the rules.
Check out my ball.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
She's calling the shots now.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
To yourself, that's where.
She won't tell me everything. It's a bank job, that's all I know.
Call it an expression of trust.
Thought you had to use some of these.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
Probably not.
Yeah. Probably not.
That's a joke, right?
Don't use language with me --
250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer.
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
It's those files you asked for.
All of 'em?
All of them.
Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
So you say.
Yes?
You're a lawyer?
Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it.
Cause of the chromium.
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
A number for the whole group, or for us?
Five million dollars.
Any school you want.
And get someone to help around the house.
If you hadn't used profanity --
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
Out to lunch with the girls.
Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
Excuse me?
Lemme see it, will you?
A ten percent raise and benefits.  But that's it.  I'm drawing the line.
What, you think I'm made of money?
And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
That's crazy -- why not?
Bullshit.
Okay, fine.  I don't know shit about shit. But I know the difference --
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
You think there's more?
Yeah, yeah.  Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy.
<u>No</u>.
No --
Show me the document that proves that.
Really?  It makes me sick.
Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
What?  Who?
I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
So what are you thinking?
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
Not in my world.
Gee, I wonder why.
Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.
Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
Kurt thought?  What about you?  Do you think anymore?
And, what, I'm not serious?
No one's taking anything --
Uh-huh.
This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
Erin --
Erin?  What are you --
Say you were wrong.
I was wrong.
How do you know that?
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
Here what comes?
The extortion, the threats ...
I wasn't gonna --
Yesterday.
Corey.
Good.
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
I guess I did.
Nope.  Maiden.
You're married.
There's more than one kind?
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
Hunh-uh.  What's that?
How come you're not eating?
Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.
I don't know.
George!
Some meeting.  With PG&E people.
PG& -- Are you sure?
In the conference --
We'll see.
When?
No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes.
I do.
Which number do you want, George?
You got more than one?
Return 'em.  Maybe you'll get your money back.
Yeah, and whose fault is that?
How?
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
Better safe than sorry.
Fixing a leak under your sink.
I'm gonna clean it up.
You're someone to me.  You're someone real special to me.
Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
Lock the door.
No, I wanna say hi.
Bull<u>shit</u>, Erin.  Bullshit.
About what?
What's that?
I need it.
I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.
Mm-hm.
I don't do favors for you anymore.
Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
That's okay.  I understand.
Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
I had photos of my kids, plus a mug --
I am not talking to you, bitch.
Have you been logging on?
What?
Yeah.  Who are you?
What?
I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
Next week.
Yes?
He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!
The Emperor?
Come in, Admiral.
Yes, Admiral .... soon.
Much anger in him, like in his father.
We've discussed this before.
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.
No ... there is another.
You must.  Luke, look at me!
I'm cold ... so cold ...
Luke ... you are the only hope.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
Right.
What's wrong with him?
Barks an argument and shakes his head.
Barks and growls at his boss.
No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
What happened?
Barks his agreement.
Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
The temperature is dropping too fast.
You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
I have felt it.
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
He will join us or die, My Master.
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
Fine.  But they'll have to take care of themselves.
Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
Sit down, and shut up!
It can wait.
I'm going to see what it is.
Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
We?
Yes.
Sure ... If I were interested. But I don't think it'd be much fun.
No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
What was it?
Now don't panic.  We don't know that.
Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
I'll be surprised if we ever start moving.
Or you ran into something ....
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
Now you're making sense.
That should do nicely.
How do I look?
Beautiful.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
Would you please stop calling me that?
Why?
I do not!
Where?
Outside, in the cave.
But the tremors have stopped.
The entrance is collapsing!
Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
Here ... near the Anoat system.
Never heard of that system.
Who's staring?
You look silly.
You look great.
Has Threepio turned up yet?
Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
Me either.  They had me howling on the scan grid, but they never asked me any questions.
... just remember that, cause I'll be back ...
That's two you owe me, junior.
Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
Are you kidding?
I always said you were a gentleman.
Don't ask me, but he's on his way.
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.
Not really.
We have no use for your kind.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
I didn't say anything?
What?
Are the coordinates set?
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
Not yet.  They're working on it now.
We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
Closer?!
Oh my, no!
I thought you knew this person.
I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
What are you talking about?
He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
Luke, no!  It's a trap.
I've never seen it fail.
You are reckless!
You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.
I thought I was in good shape.
That is why you fail.
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
Only what you take with you.
It is the future you see.
If it must be.  Yes.
And I too.
That won't be necessary.
It won't get through the blockade.
I want that ship.
They suggested oranges.
My name is Lewis -- Lewis Dixon .
Believe what?
That primitive apes can talk.
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
And we can watch ...
A display of primitive apparatus --
I don't believe it.
Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
They look pretty docile.
Yes, but don't take any chances.
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
I'm a psychiatrist.
I like you.
Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.
You never heard of Snake Plissken?
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved.
He's... near.
Cuervo, look out behind you!
I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
What's in it for me?
Don't lie to me.
All right, so I made another deal.
I got a new deal for you.
I see your point. What's the favor?
Say goodnight, Carjack.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
I don't know yet.
If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
Somebody get off!
What's the little black box do?
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
You don't understand. It's already in you.
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
A medical team will be standing by.
No.
Good.
Lock fuel rods.
Locked.
Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
I'm here.
It's history. I gotta go.
So where's Plissken?
No way.
I said pull over.
Right over there.
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right.
We'll see.
Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
If he lets you get close enough.
Looking to get out.
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Down that way.
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
You need help.
Like hell I do.
I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
Sewers. Come on.
The freeway.
Find Cuervo Jones.
Who?
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
Well, I'll think it over.
You're running out of time.
Thank God.
Give me the prototype.
Who ain't?
Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
I will not.
But your life and lands are far from here.
I gave up my castles and my lands!
It is deep...
Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
Speak of the devil!...
I want to thank you.
That's not why you came.
'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.
Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
In the great book.
What book is that?
The dragon! There...
...of course...
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...
Rise, Mordred.
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
Well hurry then, and get it.
I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness.
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers.
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
You, my lord.
Why?
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
Who?!
You.
Me?
To me? But why?
Love demands it.
--Nothing!
He has given up.
You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
Twenty days!? The world is that big?
It is.
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
Maybe... maybe...
Why?
Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...
I am the desert, where water disappears--
--I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
I?
You didn't ask!
To kill and be king, is that all?
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
Well what's wrong?
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
Fuck it.
How about Lankaster Merrin.
No, he's working on another book.
Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
In here!
Hi, how'd your day go?
Oh great, anything else?
And you got an invitation.
Dinner at the White House.
No kidding.
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
Why don't you let me?
Didn't who tell me?
Burke.
We have to start looking for a shrink.
I can't believe it.
What is it?
Phonograph.
Storage.
It's serious?
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
May I ask...?
We still don't know.
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
Not that I know of.
Want to ask him?
Never mind.
What's her name?
Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
All right then we've got clean rats.
I just heard them Karl.
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
Karl!!
She is going to be well?
What!
A man to see you.
What man?
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
How are you today?
Fine thank you.
That's good.
Yes, I think so.
It affects concentration.
What is it? A tranquilizer?
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
Please go away.
Yeah, it would've helped. Have you gotta cigarette Father?
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
Pretty close?
Pretty close.
About my daughter?
No I didn't know you had one.
He didn't mention?
No.
He didn't mention her.
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
That depends.
On what?
The priest.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Oh, will you help her! Just help her!
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
No, is Regan aware of it?
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
It's not important good night.
Please.
Are you sure?
It's fine really, sit.
In Europe.
Have you told him what's happening?
Well I think you should.
What?
Father?
No.
Um........Stuff.
What kind of stuff?
When can I have one?
We'll see Regan.  Now about those party invitations.......
You like it?
Oh it's so funny.
I found it.
Where?
Yeah.
You know how?
Here I'll show you.
No you don't. I do it all the time.
Oh yeah, well let's both play.
Captain Howdy.
Who's Captain Howdy?
He's nice.
Here I'll show you.
You think?
Cause I like it.
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
Well you know it's okay.
But you like him.
I don't know, I just thought.
Well your thinking's not so good.
How do you know?
God gets lonesome for us, Rags. He wants us back.
My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!!
Honey it's to help you.
Honey this is Father Dyer.
Hi Father.
Karras.
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
That's good.
Okay.
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
Where'd you get it then?
I stole it.
Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
Stealing is a sin.
I came to say goodbye.
You just missed them.
How's the girl?
She seemed fine.
Sure.
Withering Heights.
Who's in it?
Another one. Had your lunch?
No.
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
In here. With us.
It would bring us together.
You and Regan?
You and us.
Uh Huh.
In time.
No now.
Ego te abslovo.
Quod nomen mihi est?
Bon Jour.
Quod nomen mihi est?
La plume de ma tante.
Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
Holy water.
How's your leg?
Last month.
No.
No momma.
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
In the face of the enemy.
And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her.
The Lord be with you.
And also with you.
O'Lord hear my preyer.
And let my cry come unto thee.
The Lord be with you.
And also with you.
Her heart.
Can you give her something?
She'll go into coma.
Don't listen.
What's this about?
From the psychiatric end.
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Yeah, a fall.
Unlikely.
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
Very much.
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
Alright. You know who I think really did it?
I could have you deported, you know that?
Are you tired?
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
...Be gone!!
Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!
...from this creature of God!!!
Yes?
Do you have an appointment?
Yes
Are you a relative?
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
Yes.
How old are you?
Twelve.
Is there someone inside you?
Sometimes.
Who is it?
I don't know.
Is it Captain Howdy?
I don't know.
Why not?
I'm afraid.
You're not going to drive.
Give me the keys!
You're not going to drive!
It's my goddamn car!
It's our goddamn car!
Give me the keys.
No.
Yeah, come on in.
Mondays.
Take it now.
What about tomorrow?
We don't need you, Frankie.
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
Swimming trunks.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
Just the same.
Suit yourself.
You bring trunks, Jack?
Baker.
What's our friend's problem?
Teeth.
They're falling out.
How many?
No bones.
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
No.
Oh.  What do you do?
Two at a time?
What's wrong with the kid?
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
How's the birthday girl?
A little stiffer, but just as sturdy.
Twenty years, Ma ...
When they coming in?
Two nights.
How we doing?
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
Am I late?
That's not the point.
Frank.
Jack.
Christ, will you look at your hair?
No one's gonna be looking at my hair.  Come on, we're on.
Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!
Huh?
Count it.
Jack...
Count the fucking money, Frank.
Fuck him.  Great.  Terrific.  Fuck him.
You're their uncle.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
It was an accident.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
Bosen black.  Flat.
What d'you say, Willie?  Tighten her up?
Yamaha white.  Nice.
Try the black Knable.
You look awful.
Thanks.
Really.  You sleeping?
Only on odd days.
Seeing anyone in particular?
Why the interest?
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
Funny.  Strike a bell?
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
It's more than that.
No, I mean it.
So do I.
We gotta go, Jack.
I don't gotta go.
Says who?
Your older brother.
You'll see.
What do you mean?
Her hands.  Like that.
Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.
It's me.
Frank?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
It's not family.  It's business.
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
What're you talking about?
Yeah, okay.
Your doorbell doesn't work.
What?
The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
Terrific.
You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
I don't know what you mean.
The hell you don't.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
No?
No.
What was it like?
Hey, you weren't there.  Right?
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
I'm not unhappy.
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
It never was.
What?
Let's get it over with.
All right.  What's your name?
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
I didn't get her number.
Okay?
It's early.
Come on, stand still.
Get out of here!
It's not gonna hurt you.
I'll hit you, Frank.  I swear.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
Here, how's this?
How about these?
Yeah.  Something.
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
You wanna get a drink?
Yeah, fine.
You recognized me.
Just a lucky guess.
So what do you think?
Very realistic.
First night?
Day.  Wednesday.
Sunday.
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.
Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
Unless you want the right.
No, you take the right.
Yeah.
All night?
Yeah.
Why would I mind?
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell us what he's trying to say.
What?
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
Two hours ago!
Time flies, huh?
No. Why?
What?
We were just having a little discussion about morality.
Huh?
What are you talking about?
How come I didn't hear anything?
Celebrating.  Join me?
The party's over.
April.
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
You're making things up, Frank.
What do you mean?
Just until we find another girl.
Cancel, Frank.
No.
Nothing. We get nothing.
I don't know. Some disease.
What disease?
I don't know.
You don't know?
Seventy-one
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
Shut up, Frank.
What're you doing?
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
I can keep the beat.
Yeah?
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
So what'd you think?
Thrilling.  Both of you.
The audience was a little off tonight.
No, we're not.  Jack?
Just call me a cab.
All right.
The flu.
So she's got a few sniffles.
Doctor's orders.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
What am I gonna do?  Put a record player out there?  Bad, Frankie.  Bad.
I'm sorry?
It's one of Jack's favorites.
Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.
Well ... thanks.  Bye.
What do you mean?
We're finished.
What about me?
My watch is broken, too.
Punctuality.  First rule of show business.
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
How should I take it?
Impersonally.
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
Miss --
You find a girl?
What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
That's the premise.
Uh ... we'll let you know.
When we know.
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
We're a team.  We work together.
What-?
We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.
Where's your dress?
What's he talking about?
That!  You can't wear that!
What's wrong with it?
Am I missing something?
Hey!
Time for what?
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Save it for your wife.
Nine?
Nine!
Big feet.
Uh... good.
Zip me up?
Right.
They're nines.
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Oh, thanks.
Piece of cake.
Switch?  What fucking switch?
Did you hear it?
Hey!
Maybe.  I'll call him.
So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.
For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Sorry.  It only plays static.
Baker's unabridged.
Virgins?
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
Jack?
It's paradise.  That's what it is. Paradise.
Great?
Yeah.
As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
Peggy Lee?
Tell her.
What do you say we send a bottle over?
I don't believe it.  You're a romantic, Frank.
Well then ... shall we?
Forget it.
What?
What're you talking about?  They love it.
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
Uh, well ...
Thanks, Lloyd.
Gotta go.
How come?
Job.
Funny job.
Will I see you again?
Baker.  Jack Baker.
Right.  Bring him back.
Come on, Ed.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
Baker.
Right.  In there.
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
Yeah, well, couldn't I take a look now?
All right.  Hold on.
The name's Baker --
Save it.  What's he look like?
Black.  Labrador.
Frank works hard.
And you don't?
He leads, I follow.
Is that the way it is?
Pretty much.
It's been a long time, Ma.
Yes.  I supposed you still have that old phone booth.
He'll come around.
Not for money. With my mother.
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
His kid's sick.
Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
Nothing personal --
Every year.
Aren't the kids asleep?
Every year.
So why's he do it?
I guess in case one year they're not.
Can't sleep?
In and out.
Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
Like a baby. You?
No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
Hey, business is business.
Just dinner and dance, right?
Guess I got a little scattered.
It's a shitty  song.
Better than that.
Nothing.
What'd I say?
Nothing.
You're upset.
I'm not upset.
All I said was you were good.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
What's that supposed to mean?
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
How do you know?
Who's Nina?
Friend.
Ed? How many people live here?
Soap convention.
Soap?
Huh?
He called her.
So, what happened?
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Frank wasn't 'there.
Coffee?
Yeah... No.
Look, if you want to leave...
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
There's always another girl.
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
So ... ?
We outgrew each other.
Yeah.
Huh?
Vegetables.
Hi.
No.
Losing his teeth.
Another five years, huh?
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
He's got blood in his eye.
Eddie did.
Sounds big.  What's he do?
My days are not the old days, genius.
The recent past.
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
I guess it's getting serious.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Looks old.
Older than me.
Wow.
Ever go to church?
Okay.  How'd yours go?
Not so good.
Yeah?
Merry Christmas.
Good to see you, Ma.
Fine.  You?
Oh, fine.
Huh? Oh, no.
None?
I'm not much for sweets.
He's losing his teeth.
They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
You mean if I get sick?
Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
Yeah -- me.
Drive.
My place.
Should be.  It's yours.
Of course he is ...  -- He's yours too.
Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
Like ...
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
Only one you've never broken.
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
For what?
For being one helluva guy.
"Thanks?"  I guess they really did fuck you up.
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
I'm late for surgery.
It's important.
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
How come?
You want me to tell you it's okay to leave?  Okay, go on!  GO!
Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
What more proof do you need?
Tell me what happened on April 9th -- 13 years ago.
That's what they always say.
Damn right.
Either way, come Saturday morning -- I'm pulling you the hell out of there.
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
And how much will your "fun" net you this time?
Not anymore.
It can't be.  It's impossible.
Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
Not if I kill you first ...
Shoot him!
I'm going to have you fired.
Or what?  You'll have me fired?
Trust me, he's already here. Get going!
I won't tell mom if you don't.
I mean like protection.
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
Kim?
That's your name, isn't it?
You always call me Miss Brewster.
Get rid of them.
The Admiral?
Castor's escaped!
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
Obviously someone else knows it!  Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW!
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
Yeah -- it's Santa's Magic fucking Village.  Your present's in here.
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
No problem.
Like I fucking care?  I'm not just sitting here!
You've made us look pretty good in the past week.  And the way you handled the press --
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
What do you know about it?
As much as ever.  Nothing.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
You always say that -- then you leave.
Call me spontaneous.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Okay, if you insist. But -- you drive.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
-- Studying.
Good.  Because I'm fed up.
Ooh, my suits are ready...
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
A broker? Really. And now youre in the tire business?
Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?
Im sure you do...
What about me?
Whats going on here?
Is this another one of those Sun Tzu Art of War tricks?
Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
Im not worried, Mom. Hes still learning our ways...
I dont know...
Who did?
Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
On a case by case basis...
I think I could figure it out.
Bye...
Big Eds.
Thats where you work.
Dont you think thats a little gimmicky?
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Ah. A classic...
Ringing my bell...
No, honey. Go back to sleep.
I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
Trouble at work?
I dont think so.
Its not Kate, is it?
She is relentless.
So could you write down her exact address?
Screw the rules.  Im talking about the choice.
Its your birthday? Today?  Whats your name?  Where were you born?
Its me, Jack...
Howd you know my name?
Yes...Jack Campbell...
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we couldve been really good friends...
What the hell are you talking about?  Whats he talking about?
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise itll be returned!
No.
Yes you do...
Damn, you are the real thing...
I call all you white guys "Jack."
Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
Me?
I've got everything I need.
Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
What the hell is happening to me?!
Do I look like I live in a bottle?
What're you talkin' about?
Get out, I call 911.
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
Its lovely...
Need a nurse?
Youre a nurse?
Are we what, Jack?
Is there something going on between us?
It would help me if we were.
Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
Thanks.  To you too...
Frank.  Wheres Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
Thank you.
Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...
Well, Im just a little confused right now about why I work here...
If youre into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
You want me to handle him?  I think Im ready...
Howd you do this year, Tony?
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
No, youre right.  What are we doing?
We're being responsible.  Go. Get on the plane.
You hear me complaining about that?
Yeah...fine.
I was in the city.
The city?  New York City?  Why?
Because thats where I live.
Jack...dont even start...
Because youll be here.
Funny, Jack.  Im laughing on the inside.
Youre kidding me...
Shes your dog, Jack.
No, shes not.
HEY!
And...?
That is the general idea, yes...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
Do what?
She got those shoes...
Sure.  I really like Annie.
Good, Jack.  Maybe well keep her.
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
If you want to look at it that way...
How would you look at it?
I want it...
Its good, right?
What...?
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Then say it...just say it to me...!
What? You make me hot...
No, open it...
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
But Im gettin close, right?
Now...I dont...
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
What are you sure about?
Ill just full yours up to the top.  Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
Way out...
Thats all I wanted to hear...
Its like a museum.
For the week?
A perk for what?
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
Youve been Jack Campbell.  And thats always a good thing...
Promise me again...
I promise. Come to bed, honey.
Its good to see you...
Dont worry about it, Jack...
Not with what they pay me...
Youre not married, are you?
Jesus, Jack...
Dont get on that plane!
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
I need you, tiger..
Where is he?
Aspen.
Not by a long shot.
Do I know you?
But youre not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
Youre a little tougher, Peter.
Thats easy. Youve seen my car.
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
Hey, are you okay?
Is there anything I can do for you?
Last night was great...
I'd like that, too.
Tonight.
I've got plenty of places to go.
Merry Christmas...
Christmas?  It cant be Christmas...
Hey, kind of giving up Christmas day for my ex-boss here.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
This ain't permanent.  My friend Reed's working on a cure...I think.
I mean...
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?
Relax, it's casual.
I like the sound of that.
Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
This makes five.
Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
I should have done more, run more tests --
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Ben.  Are you okay?
Am <u>I</u> okay?!  You wanna explain that?!
Yeah, nine years straight.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
O-kay.  We'll skip that question.
Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.
Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Don't you wander off, boy.
They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
Go back to the drawing board.
Really?  With a name like Von <u>Doom</u>? Never saw <u>that</u> one coming.
Out front?  You home, baby?  I got a surprise for you.
I already got it.  Everything I want.
I'm worried about you.
About me?  How sweet.
What is this?  Where's Reed?
Where do you <u>think</u>?  With <u>Sue</u>.
Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
Oh, he did.
<u>What</u> did he do to the uniform?!
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
Victor must've taken him.
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
That's terrible news...
Ben!  Ben!
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Cool.  What'd it do to you guys?
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
I can go hotter!
But all these people...
<u>Now</u>.
So are you!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
Last one down springs for room service.
Not this again --
No: You're <u>ON FIRE</u>!
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
Okay, "mom."
I think that thing is Ben.
Is that a trick question?  C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Dude.  That's my sister.
Blockhead started it!
No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
But Johnny...you <u>can't fly</u>.
Showtime.
Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Later.  First, I've got some unfinished business.  A deal that needs closing...
Reed, we're running out of time.
<u>Ben</u> did this?
<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --
It's been changed.
That's good.  That's uh...good.
Passion.
What?  What do you mean you --
Sue...<i>look at your hands</i>.
What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
That's what we're here to find out.
If it happened to him, then it could...
I'm sure I can come up with something.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
Of course.  Of course.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...
No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
<u>I'm</u> not the only one in there.  I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
I'm sure I can come up with something.
A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
You can't leave them out there.
Victor, are you feeling alright?
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Same old Reed.  All analysis, no action.  Wasn't that the problem with you two?
Oh, I think you already have.
Victor, we <u>can't do anything</u> until the research is ready.
Medical's ready.
Phase Two.
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.
Message to Proteus.
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
Let's find what the devil's holding them up!  Contact the Proteus!
I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
I'd hold that off awhile.
Well, how about hypnosis? That can't hurt him!
The Pentagon, wasn't it, General? Only you weren't in that uniform...
The Other Side got to him.
How bad off is he?
Brain injury.
<Me>?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
No question of her loyalty.
Say that again?
Trip? Where to?
As part of the Crew.
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
It's only for an hour --
Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
Yes?
He's blanked out on that one particular point.
Glad to have you with us, Mr. Grant.
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
With no laser --
Yes, Cora.
I -- I want to say...
They're much smaller than bacteria...
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
You may learn to like it.
I always thought it was nothing but red.
And if it should take more time to get through --
But I did. I'm positive!
I have no idea.
Not now. We need air, not greetings!
I've got a source. All I have to do is tap it.
I feel much better now...
That's what they pay me for.
A great deal more than that, I believe...
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
What gives you that idea?
Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
It's too late now. We must go on.
Nothing -- against all that force.
All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
You left something out.
What's that?
The Breath of God...
Everything can be divided in half, no matter how minute.
Oxygenation...
No, there's no other way.
What about Dr. Michaels?
It's too late!
How are you, Miss Peterson?
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
If there's any chance --
Request removal, Mr. Grant.
There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.
Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
Let's hope... So far, somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
That line was tampered with...
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
It's possible --
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
Where we going?
Go ahead.
And she said it was indelible...
That makes two of us.
Remind me to ask you about the love life of an octupus.
Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
We can get out through the Lab Section.
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
I could use a lawnmower...
Looks simple to operate.
I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
Then don't drift down further.
I'll do what I can.
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here.
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
May I have your ticket, please?
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
Drop that fucking money!
No Jean, no money!
Is this a fucking joke here?
Unghh... oh, geez...
It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
...What're you talking about?
Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
What?
We stop at Pancakes Hause.

Yeah.
Jezhush.
No, that's not it, Jerry.
Huh?
Well, okay, it's -
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
Yeah, you already said that.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
My wife! What the - how's -
What the heck d'ya mean?
Three people. In Brainerd.
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
I'll see you tomorrow.
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
They can really take over, that's for sure.
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
Yah, he -
Where'd you get him that parka?
Oh, don't be silly.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Oh, don't be silly.
Mr. Mohra?
Yah.
Officer Olson.
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
Uh-huh - in what way?
Just a general way.
Yah, got a front movin' in.
Ya got that right.
Pretty darn good, ya want some?
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
Uh-huh.
Yah.
Chaska.
Can you be any more specific?
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like.
A subconscious-type thing.
Yah, that can happen.
Yah.
Uh-huh.
You're not a C student.
Uhn.
You know what a disparity is?
You're sayin' - what're you sayin'?

Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.

Sir? Right now?

Okay, real good, then.

Well, what do ya mean?
Jerome Lundegaard?
Yah!

Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.

Yah.

I know it's a lot.
I mean a parking lot.
What's goin' on there?
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
We might be innarested.
2:30.
What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
Yah.
We're good to loan in.
Yah.
No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime -
Ah, dammit!

Anyone else residing there?
Nope.

Geez. Well - geez. That's a suprise.

There's the car! There's the car!
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
Don't go in! Wait for back-up!
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
Love ya, Margie.

Prowler needs a jump.

Yah, ya think?
Oh, pretty good. They bitin'?
Not on your feet too much?
No, no.

Yah.
Three-cent stamp.
Your mallard?
Yah.
Norm, that's terrific!
It's terrific!
That's terrific.
I love you, Norm.
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
Congratulations, Jerry.
He's at -
Well... Why don't we...
Where's Tyler?
The first rule of Project --
Right, right.
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
Better than I've ever been in my life.
Really?  Great.  Still "Remaining Men Together?"
Really, what's that?
You are?!
Look at my face.
Yeah, both of us.
He was full of pep.  Must've had his grande latte enema.
Yes.
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
Pretend you're me.  You find this. What would you do?
Does this sound strange to you?
Yes, sire, strange.  Very strange.
Dynamite?
It means it was homemade.
This is... really a shock...
I'll ask the questions, son.
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
You need to lighten up.
Can't you give me something?
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
Sure.
Practicing what?
Go ahead.  I'll expose you.
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
Really?
Please.  Can't we do something... ?
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
I don't know -- am I?
You can't have the whole brain!
So far, you have four and I only have two!
Then, take blood parasites.  It's yours.  Now we each have three.
We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
Let's not make a big thing out of it.
You haven't been going to yours.
I found a new one.
Really?
It's for men.
Like testicular cancer?
Look, this is a bad time...
So you're staying in tonight?
What... ?
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Please.
Good.
Here.
There?
Here.
Here.
Feel anything?
No.
You feel nothing?
Nothing.
No... no problem.
I wish I could return the favor.
I could check your prostate.
Uh ... nah.
Well... thanks, anyway.
Whatever.
Do you care?
I don't know.
Hear what?
That... sawing and hammering.
... A person.
Guy or girl?
Why would you get bent if I asked?
Let go of me...  Leave me alone.
You're afraid to say.
Can I come in?
He's not here.
What?
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
Is that what you're calling it?
Answer the question!
What did you say... ?
What is wrong with you?
Say my name.
What... ?
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
Marla...
Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll never have to see me again.  Here... here...
Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away a couple of weeks, at least.
Yes.
I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm fine...
Who's this?
Tyler?
Who's this?
You fucking slut!!
Is this a test, sir?
Yes... it's a test.
You were in here last Thursday night.
Is this part of the test?
What do you want me to do?
I mean -- for a living.
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
How's that working out for you?
Being clever.
And, now it's gone.
All gone.
Delivered from Swedish furniture.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
Do what you like.
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
Yeah.
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Can I stay at your place?
Yes, you can.
Thank you.
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
Don't watch.  I can't if you watch.
You get the idea.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
Where do you want it?  In the face?
Like hell.  That counted.
Strange.
But a good strange.
Is it?
The fight.
What fight?
This fight, pussy.
Anyone.
My dad.  No question.
What car?
What?
Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
Alive or dead?
Doesn't matter.
Hemingway.  You?
Shatner.  William Shatner.
Okay... Ghandi.
You?
I'm fine.
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
Hey... don't knock librarians.
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
Listen... do me a favor... sit here a minute...
Promise you won't.
Yes, I promise.
Promise?
I said I promise!
That was three times you promised.
Uh... nah...
Shhhhhh!  I don't know what to make of this, sir, I really don't...
Don't mention me.
A liposuction clinic.
I was going to my cave to find my power animal.
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
We don't... ?
You quit?
Yeah.  Where you headed?
Work.  Going to work.
Nothing.  Do what you like.
Fucking sweet.
I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.
I thought you did.
Homework assignment.
What is it?
Tell him!
Imagine how he feels.
Hey.
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
What should I have told you?
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?!
Nothing.
... is over.
... is over.
Wait a minute...
What's this all about, Tyler?
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
Why did you do that?
Answer me, Tyler.
Why do people think anything?
I don't know!  Tell me!
What are you talking about... ?
You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...
What... what are you saying?
It's okay.  We okay... a little codependent, sure, but...
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
You took me to the house.
The house is rented in your name.
You have jobs.
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
What about Marla?
What about Marla?
She's... you... you're fucking her.
Um, well... technically, no.
What a ridiculous thing to say.
I can't let you...
...stop me?
I'm not going...
...to let this happen!
Stop finishing...
You don't know that.  There could still be people inside.
This is not about martyrdom.
Green?  Did you say green?
I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.
You want out?
What?
Defuse the bomb.
Defuse the bomb, please.
Defuse the bomb?
Yes.
It's out of our hands.  This is it.
Paraffin.
Not exactly according to plan.
Do we have to do everything ourselves?!
Why what?
I'm doing this for us.
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
You will.  You know you will.
What have you left for me?
What?
Appreciate something.
What?
Look at me...
What?
Maintenance.
Excuse me?
You told me you'd say that.
You told me you'd say that, too.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
Well, sir, you said you might.
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
Irvine?  Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.
It's free to all.
Ain't that something?
Yes, it is.
You're welcome to join our club.
Did you hear what I just said?!
You and your friend.
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
Let go of me!!
"Stuff."  Were the mid-terms hard?
Why?
I... I don't know...
Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
No, please, no, God, no!
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
I hope you're ready for this.
I...I...
How you doing in there, hero?
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
Yeah, fuck 'em.  No offense.
I have to save Eugene!
He probably already knows we're coming.
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
Yeah, you should have specified.
Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
Of course not.  That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
I've got to stop and help those people.
Do you want to deliver this baby?
Maybe.  What's this about?
May we come in?
Take a guess.
Anyway, I guessed it right and won these.
...My Premonition was just like his.
I did.  And right now, I don't think she cares.
Who is this guy, anyway?
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
How do you know?
I wasn't worried about us.
Impossible.  She was on the onramp.
I know.  I can feel it too.
Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
No, I'm good.
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
For Christ sakes girl, take a breath.
I guess so.
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
Hey, Dad.  What's up?
That it's not over yet.
I love you too, Dad.  Goodnight.
I know, we'll be there soon.
Who am I, David Blane?
Yeah?
Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
Remember the gate number?
Thirty-nine.
Most kids never have it happen.
They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
Easy, Billy, just open it.
Don't do it! Don't do it!
No! No! Don't!
Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
I wish you were on the plane!
Look, there's something you should all know.
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
It doesn't matter who's next... we're all on the same list.
Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
Oh, you've noticed it, too?
No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.
No harm. No foul.
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
No one's that strong.
Terry's name should be on this wall.
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
You have a responsibility to tell me.
Not with us in the fuckin' car!
That's what I'm doin'!
WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
What just happened?
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
Yeah.  Second set.  Let's go.
That's what I'm here for.
Read you.
Home on my strobe.
This is state-of-the-art firepower.
There's a compass in the handle.
There are no worse places.
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
Damn!  Leeches.
I had it cupped.
Fermented fish sauce.
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
Powerful warrior.
Sometimes they do.  They're river pirates.  Opium runners.
I need a vacation.
Nothing we can do, man.
I suppose you have...
Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?
You comin'?
How much we got left in that minigun?
It means "virgin."  My mother was comedian.
I thought he was with you.
Crazy motherfucker.
Huntington Beach, California.
You think you are... .
Invulnerable.
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch "Dynasty."
I couldn't get you in.
How?
It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
That's an order.
Sorry, Sir.
I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
Not yet.
I'm not jumping blind.
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
I was crossed-trained in gunships.
That's right.
He... took it.
About 22 hours on site.
Nice work.
Couple hours.  Let me buy you a coffee.
I know.
Have fun.
American.  Come to get you out.
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
Can you walk?
Colonel.
Mind if I sit down?
That's it.  My life.
Those men are all dead.
You're not.
Yeah.  Big time.
This just occurred to somebody, now?
Yeah.
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.
Do I look like I have someone special?
Fine.
Meeting ... people.
It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything.
Yeah!
The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat.
Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?...I'll cook tonight.
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
<u>What</u>!
<u>Oh my God</u>... <u>What did they do</u>!  <u>My</u> <u>God</u>!!!
You're all right... you sure...
I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --
You still believe in God?
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
He's not a moron.
And who's Lydia?
I... You're not going to understand this.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
What does that mean?
See, I told you!
Well, what the hell does that mean?
Thank you very much.
My agent.  I called my agent.
You're kidding!  What did he say?
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
Right now, I'm just not sure about... making such definite plans.
Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
Okay... I know but... I met this beautiful girl...
Uh... basement I think...
<u>I tell him no visitors</u>!!!
No...  He is supposed to live there?
I'm... just looking for Parry...
He's not here.
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
No...no...we can't...we can't..
Venice...Like Katherine Hepburn in SUMMERTIME. . ....Why can't I be Katherine Hepburn...
I'm a man with a mission, Jack.
NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
Come on now...You can't sit here.
I... I was just leaving.
Good.  You believe this drunk?
<u>No</u>...<u>No</u> <u>please</u>...!
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
I was nine in the sixties.
Yeah?  Who is this?
<u>No!</u>  <u>I told you</u>! <u>You won a contest</u>!
Yes.  They're free.
Lydia.  Lydia what?
"OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!
I know a great place.  ...UH...WARREN!
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
Hi... Where are my shoes?
They're --  -- What?
Where -- ?
<u>What</u>!?
<u>What</u>?!
Sshhhh!
They said you're The One.
I'm the one what?
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
Take a guess...  <u>Let him guess</u>!!  <u>Tch</u>.
They work for Him.
Him...?
Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
Parry... I'm Jack.
I know...
Funny -- you look married.
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
What's her name?
I don't know.
No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
Can I take you to lunch?
Well what am I gonna do with it?
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
So what? You going to help me?
The Red Knight!
The Red...?  You're totally gone, aren't you?
What?
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
<u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...
No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
Ha, ha, ha, ha rubbish...now begone...before somebody drops a house on you!...
You're out numbered son.
OWW...MAN...
No just Parry.
Oh...like Moses.
Yeah.
Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
There isn't any more to tell.
You don't have to say that.
I never say anything I have to.
Listen, I'm not feeling well.
No.
You have a disease.
Will you stop!...  ... I'm in love with you...
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
Serveza yourself!
Now, now.
No, dammit, I would easy.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
That's right, hand.
Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
You got another ball comin'.
You just going to sit there?
I hope they do.
You're the pathetic one, not me.
I'm not some piece a crap.
I know you're not.
You treat me like I was.
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
You'll be gone, period.
I love it.
What the hell is that?
Is what you?
You're depressed that I come along.
Who said I was depressed?
Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...
If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
It brings out my eyes...
What?
Just finish eating.
You got any change?
Fill it up.
Palm Apodaca.
Alaska.
Alaska? Are you on vacation?
No. How much do I owe you?
Five'll do it.
I'll come back when you've made up your mind...
Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
Are you talking to us?
Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
Hi, Tita.
Now don't...
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
That's good.
Don't, then.
Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
Thank you...  Oh no, don't put it on there...
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
No kidding.
Very nice.
Everybody still up on the Island?
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
Robert, I have to tell you something...
Daddy's very ill.
Oh, well, what, what's he...
He's had two strokes.
Wait...
Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't I?
All right...
A couple of months.
It's not that bad.
A week or two isn't going to ruin your life, for Godsakes.
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
What?
With applesauce?
No, thanks...
Why are you being so mean?
I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't you see that?
You know, he was formerly a sailor.
My turn.
Where's Catherine?!
I don't know where she is!
Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?!
You were going without saying goodbye?
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
But what about me?
I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
Bye, Robert.
That's dangerous, you know.
Swimming?
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
The day after tomorrow.
If you're free.
Yeah, I'll probably be free.
Of course I do. It's music. You know...
Thank you.
You had no inner feeling?
None.
At being a fake.
I think it's what you think.
No, it isn't what I think.
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
Shut up...
That's right.
I don't believe vou.
Something witty and devastating like that.
What?
I'll be back later...
What?! I can't hear you!
Just give me a chance, will you?
That'll make you happy.
I hope it will, yes.  I'm sorry.
Is she?
What?
Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.
All right, let's have a rematch.
Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
You're all full of shit!
It's a Borzoi.
It is true.
Besides being very rude.
I hope I didn't hear that.
I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
Well, I should hope not...
Jesus, what a rude person...
Don't call me "mack," honey.
Hold onto this.
I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't really discussing media...
Perhaps...
Yes.
If you want to call it that.
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
Fine.
Look at me.
What?
Not now, I'm busy
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
Victor.
What?
Victor.
Wussup.
Hi.
Remember me, from the pool?
Nothin'.
What are you doin' here?
I, umm, came to see you.
You know somebody around here?
No.  What you do today?
I just wanted to see you.
Of course.
So what's her name?
You got a boyfriend?
That's it?
Nah, we make out and stuff.
You look good.
How you treat them?
Good. I'm faithful to them.
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
I can't!
Wussup, Victor.
Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.
I got punished, man.
Fa what?
She fucks it all up!
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
Eddie from Compost?
No, Baruch.
You know, Eddie's cousin.
I think she lives down by Pitt.
Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
I think by Twenty-two.
What you want with her anyway'
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
You said before, that he got boxes?
I think he's 18 or 17.
You gonna talk to him?
Um, yeah I think so.
Okay, then dance. Show.
Wha'?
You here to see somebody?
Yeah.
Who?
A girl named Amanda.
What she look like?
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
Yo, that's my girl.
She didn't say she had no man.
You sure?
Positive.
Didn't I see you at Pitt yesterday?
I'm a good friend of hers.
What?
Nothing.
So, then whadda ya want?
Not really.
Hey!
Wha'?
Jus' from around the way.
You live around here?
Yeah.
You gotta girLfrLend?
You mean her.
What?
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
That's what he said.
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
Wonder who his supplier is.
I have no idea.
I ought to get some sleep.
Creasy, how old are you?
Fletch, this is dumb.
They didn't do anything.
What? What are you talking about?
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
Not luck. They don't want me.
Full name.
Fletch F. Fletch
I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights.
Ask anybody.
Can I ask anybody now?
That a boy.
Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Thank God, the police.
Go ahead. Make my evening.
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
We play tennis at the club.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
Yes.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
That's two.
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
Still, it'd an odd name. I don't remember seeing it on the club registry.
Mrs. Smith.
Joan or Margaret Smith.
Well, which one?
Margaret.
Funny old bird.
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant.
No idea.
No idea at all?
Okay. Some idea.
Like when?
Like tonight.
For sure?
My pleasure.
I'm serious, Sam.
What, the heat here?
Affirmative.
The two surfer boys?
Affirmative.
Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
You find the source?
Gum thought Brazil.
Right. Fine.
Where am I?
You're in the Records Room.
I'm fine.
Can I get you something?
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
Thank you.
That's it.
He'll be so relieved.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
Until she remarries, Fletch.
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
I agree.
You may be right.
Are you serious?
Wait a minute! Our problems might be solved.
Wait a second --
Cut the crap and read it.
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
Well, I'm fully covered.
Since he moved to L.A.
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
Course he has. That's his wife.
Of course they are.
You sure did.
Right.
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
Hi Gummy. Hows the eye?
Its okay. The cops did it.
Fletch?
What's that?
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
Twenty years.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
Yeah. Maybe.
Wait here for me, Gummy.
Because we can't.
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
Alan Stanwyk.
Charmed.
I'm all ears.
I want you to murder me.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
I have the same problem with my help.
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
I don't think you'll have to worry about that.
Sure, all drifters do.
They serve dinner on the flight?
You sure got the hard part.
Sure.
Only if you promise not to return me.
'Magic' today, huh?
Don't say shoot, okay.
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
Spot right here.
I wonder if that's his doctor.
Only one way to find out.
Yeah.
Nothing to it.
I'm sorry?
His bride. Cute as a button.
You've met her?
Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
How about Marvin's sixty-fifth birthday party?
That's a strange combination.
So were my parents.
Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!
I love the outfits.
See what I mean?
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
John Ultramalensky?
Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
You ordered it here?
Here, take mine.
God...
I saved his life during the war.
You were in the war?
No. He was. I got him out.
Can I ask you a question?
Depends on the question.
Are you still in love with Alan?
What is this?
Long story.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
That's what I want to know.
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
You saw a forgery.
I'll take you to a game.
What are you talking about?
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
I was afraid you'd say that.
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
I checked. There was no divorce.
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
You can't do that.
Don't tell me I can't --
They're trying to kill me!
You shouldn't be here.
I want to hear this.
They just left, sir.
In her cabana, sir.
One.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
Sierra del fuego.
Lock's busted.
No wonder.
Who are you?
Moved out.
She moved out?
So you're saying she moved out.
This morning.
Tell the cops.
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
...never reads the paper...
I don't know.  Look!
Looks great.
So let's go! We run the pictures.
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
I'd say charcoal.
I have some ideas.
Who? Donnie and Marie?
I want something I can print!
What?  Who the hell are they?
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
You were going to can me, right?
Not really?
I was upset.
Yeah.
Who's Frieda?
My secretary.
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
In a minute!
But I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
I ain't -- got -- you.
Please.
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
Excuse me?
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
Actually, you may take it all now.
Oh... I have some questions.
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
Have what?
Did she tell you anything?
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
Hold that thought.  Are we being shot at?
What did these Vancouver factories do?
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
No prob...
All your friends call you Jazz.
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
Go on, 'they're stahting.'
Make eye contact when you say that.
I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.
I like.
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
You're not funny.
C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so...
Three hundred.
Hey, they blew me.
Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.
Fluck you!
What?
Peachy.
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
People still watch that?
Who cares about people?
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Are you okay?
Ye-ah.
Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
No, wait...
Ye-ah.
This is fucking unbelievable.  Zuzu, it's a long story, you see...
You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
There's that question...
Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.
Yeah, Ford.  I'm okay.
Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
Did he just say what I think he said?
And hey, I appreciate it...
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
Liar!  You don't care!  About anything.
Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really.
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
Fine!
I'm off it!
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
The case!
Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
Okay.  'B-y-e!
Anyway you want it, asshole.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Go on, another time, another place.
Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
Ah, I didn't say seven <u>P</u>.M., now did I?
Are you okay?
Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
Ciao.
Julian, you're fired.
You're a poet and didn't know it.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
Only on a first name basis.
That's cute.  You're funny.
That's funny, you're cute.
I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
Hey, the poet...
Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.
It is to us!  It's computerised.
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
What?
Doyle.
What?
Mr. Doyle.
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
You don't use shit?
No. 
Cause if I do.
Everything is everything.
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
B.O.C.A.
Doesn't register.
Got a wife named Angie.
Where do you want it?
This side.
Takin' care o' business, honey.
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
You know I hadda meet some people tonight --
Don't forget anchovies. 
Fuck you, Santa Claus!
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
No... yeah...
Enchant.  Alain, j'ai rflchi  votre proposition et j'ai dcid d'accepter.
It is waiting for you in the garage.
Did they follow you?
I wasn't looking.
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
Who's this --
... Salvatore?...
Yes --
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
It's yours too!
Si tu veux.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Pour moi?
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Non!
I'm going to put them on the cat.
Il fallait le faire.
Il est en retard.
We must follow it.
But will they?
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
S'right.
Fake it.
He got off on six.
No, I figure he stays here.  Where's your registration?
Des Moines.
Marseilles.
Why not?
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
Yeah!
Where the hell is it?
Morning.  Sometime.
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
Tumble it.  One end to the other.
How'd I know he had a knife.
Never trust a nigger.
He coulda been white.
Not a chance.
Whip it out.
Policy man in Queens.
He probably sells insurance.  Owns a chicken farm in Hackensack.
Toy wit' this will ya.
We're goin' now!  Goodbye.
Yeah.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
I can't.
We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.
Pour it in your ear.
Four.
Third time around.
Hiya, Jesus.
Forty dollars -- was $250.
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
What was it?
It was a crematorium.
For garbage?
For dead bodies.
You remember Mary Finelli?
What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.
No, I don't.
Well, I think you do.
They around?
Where's the collar, in the cells?
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
I'll go find Hayes.
Switches are shorted out.
You're shitting me!
We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
The game, Graham.  The Series?
Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
I should'a been a fucking mailman.
I'm alright, Gibby.
Don't know what's behind it.
One way to find out.
Then fuckin' find it.  I'm going for the girl.
Elvis has left the building.
Hey, bud.
Well, why not a little of the King?
You alright?
The usual.
Did he?
He did.
Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long as you get there.
Nothing.  I just wanted to see you.
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
Probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work...
I love you more.
He ain't the only one.
Wish you weren't.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
I know.  He loves that thing.
So am I.
Frank...
Luck, my ass.
Hello, Frank.
No, I don't.
Do you know where I found this?
No.  This isn't what you think.
Uh, huh.
Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
Next time lets put some money on it.
Get him home safe.
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
Glad to hear that.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
Daddy, I'm scared.
C'mon, Chief, show some guts.
I'll be up soon, Little Chief.
Wait...
I'm right here behind you...
WB2YKXB, who've I got?
Name's John.
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
What'd you just say?
Oh, that was my kid.
Uh huh...
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
29-years ago.
Nothing...I just spilled something.
You just burned the desk.
What's happening?
What if it's not...
Johnny...?
I don't know.
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
I'm thirty-five years old.
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
Nah, I gave it up.
No wait, don't go!
But you're not...you're not still here.
I lost you.
What?
Why?
Fire.
On the job?
It did, Pop.  It did.
When?
October 12, 1969.
I don't understand.
Chief?!  Is that you?
Yeah, it's me.
Are you alright"?
Something happened, something...
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
What?  What is it?
She's not here.
Whatta you mean she's not here?
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
What are we like in...1998?
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
Yeah, you betcha.
You there?
I'm right here, Dad.
You all right?
Yeah, I think so...
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
In my pocket.
We got him!  Dad you got him!
Please, Dad, just do it.
Okay, okay...
Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder.  John...
We did it, John.  We stopped him.
What's wrong?
What the hell is that smell?
I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
I know pal.  I remember.  Twenty-nine years tomorrow.
Longbranch...?
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago.
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
Whoa, I just...I just...
Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him, it was real.
Yeah.  That's it.
Which means he probably knew her.
This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
What?
Yeah.  Sure.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
So how are things at the hospital?
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
You work too hard, John.
Look who's talking.
Are you a good cop, John?
I try to be.
Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
I'm sorry.  I didn't realize...  But she knew, John.  A mother knows what's in her son's heart.
Glad you did.  Come on in.  Buy you a cup of coffee?
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
No.  What house you work?
A hot shot, huh?
I hear that.
Going?  How do you mean?
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
Where's Shelly?
I don't know...
You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.
I'll think of something.
I vote for the hammock.
I love you, man!
And Hell is hot, but I ain't goin' down there either.
This is all the exercise I need...
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
Don't do that to me!
Will you come with me?
Be a man, man.
Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?
I don't know.  I flunked Spanish.
You go ahead...
Your bed.
A hammock?
Why?
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
I don't know.
You're irresistible.  I lose control.
Nothing.
Did you stay here last night?
No.  I got here just before you did.
Somebody was in here.
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
Are you all right, Shelly?
No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
What do you mean?
You promised you'd never ask me.
Sort of.
I'm sorry.
My whole world.
In that little thing?
Stick around and you'll see.
Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry.
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Everything's gonna be fine.
May be please have the wallet.
Yes.
Gulp!
Keep looking.
Maybe.
Stop the car!  Now!!
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
I have to.
You don't "have to."
I just want you to like me.
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
I never said you were "nothing".
You don't to say it.  I can tell.
No way...  ...I wanna rock!
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
We're gonna scare him?!
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
Better call an ambulance first.
I wish it was.
Happy Friday the 13th.
You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
I could swear I heard...
Yeah, that's fat too.
Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
And make sure my daughter stays put...  ...She's grounded.
It's just beginning.
What's it to ya?
No.
Why?
'Cause it stinks.
Come and get it.
Wait a minute. I just...
Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
I hope so.
Did you hear me?!
Yes.  And I said, hand me those padlocks.
No, he was real.  Like on TV.
I found it outside.
That's debatable.
Huh?
Boy scouting.
You gotta be kidding!
Yeah, we're here.
I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
I think somebody's messin' around out there.
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
I've seen it.
Yeah...They should've paid their bill.
How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
Save your...
I'm here.
I'm scared.  I'm very scared.
I need to talk to you.
I'm kind of busy right now...
You food'll be right out.
Twenty.
Look, I don't want your money!
Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
I know everything about you, Diana.
That's it, we're done.
It's going.
Legs giving you trouble?
Not so bad, today.
Do you have to ask?
Okay, I'll call you later.
N...nothing.
June the 19th.
So's he and he knows it.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
That's what I'd like to know.
For a good reason.
Tell me.
Sorry.
Tell me!
Her name's Stephanie.
Hell, when Steven was a kid, he was like, having strippers delivered to church Bingos and shit.
Next, you dial a number.
Have a good night.
Don't do anything stupid.
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
He was dead.  He had to be dead...
Until I hear the truth.
I've told you the truth.
You don't know shit!
I didn't kill her!
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
About Jessica.
-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a- bitch...
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
But she might be in trouble...
What are you going to do?
Improvise, of course.
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice.
Yeah.
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
But...wait a minute!
Ask me in about five minutes.
Nothing.
Hear what?
And you'll never do it again.
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
Rennie's not coming.
It's...dead.
What?? You sent her out there with a murderer running around loose??
The fire alarm...
Not another word, do you hear me??
Don't be ridiculous!
I packed it. Just for us.
But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
Don't be. They probably decided to explore each other rather than New York.
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
Walking corpses are not real!
What are you talking about?
Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
A wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson.
I don't think that's such a safe idea
My niece's life hangs in the balance right now!! Every second counts.
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
Am I? Let's find out.
You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
She didn't push me into coming.
But Sean said...
This isn't a request.
I...I can't...
You can and you will!!
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
Yeah...a lot.
I gathered that.
I...I don't know...
Hi, Sean.
I heard you weren't coming.
We changed our minds.
But I didn't get you one...
Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway.
I want to go home. I want off this ship.
Just radio for help, okay???
The window...
I'm not!!
Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
Please, hurry...
I opened thousands of brains.
What did you find?
Big mess every time.
Crosstown.
Very bad today.
What do you mean, we must abandon?
Ruptured steam pipe.
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
Do not inhale.
That's where I peed.
Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
Quietly effective.
Press a button and they give us money.
Ride with me. We need a haircut.
She wants a divorce.
Don't talk like that.
It's over, finished and done with.
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
But didn't we know it would happen?
We must abandon.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
What happened eighteen months ago?
A year and a half later? You're still brooding?
I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me.
Do we care?
I think we Nought to wait.
I say we go.
You say we go?
Do not inhale.
I'm not ready.
Don't wait Efor me.
What about the haircut?
Then you should carry a gun.
He'll hate it.
How do you Eknow.
What do you mean?
She was very evasive.
Unbelievable.
Classic.
What are you talking about?
Yes. What are you implying?
Did you see the winning run score?
You're not making sense. Make sense.
This could be it.
Let's work on it.
Let's work on it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
Does it feel comfortable?
Does what feel comfortable?
This could be it.
This could be it.
What about her?
She died.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
The Red Sox
We're able to surprise each other.
In and out of bed.
Because we're completely mismatched.
We don't even like each other, do we?
It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
They'll lose because they're my team.
He will absolutely hate it.
I go to college. I thought you knew.
Do you want to get some coffee?
What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?
Is it?
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
I just had breakfast with her. She didn't say a word about this.
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
I don't have a date. I don't want a date.
Everything.
There's nothing left for me to lie about.
It's only our first date.
Brilliantly moving.
Packs an emotional wallop.
A flat-out hit.
This building is not secure.
Mystery. Deception.
You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?
It's your best play, Nicky.
See, Daddy.
Two-all after six.
All right. What's been going on?
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
And you've been extremely patient.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
Alma Wetzel.
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
It violates so many trusts.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.
They're always winning. Until they lose.
Life is good.
Washed away.
One more out.
A thousand things.
You're hurting my head.
This could be it!
Life is real.
I'm at the door.
Go way. I'll call a cop.
Pop, will you let me in?
Where the hell are you?
Right here. At the door.
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
I could have grown up happy. A Yankee fan. A divorce lawyer.
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
Let's not start that again.
My back is killing me.
Where's your elastic brace?
I can't find it.
What do you want me to do?
Show him who we are.
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
How come you got the kid with you?
A grandmother. God bless you.
That's a simple subject.
What am I doing?
You're charming the boy.
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
It may be work but it's not honest work. Faith is the real work.
Life is good.
Speak it like it's real. Matthew.
Matthew.
Because life is good.
Because faith is rewarded.
It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
This could be it!
Why does it matter?
They're my team.
appreciate that, Sidney. But our leading man can't remember his lines. And his understudy can't carry the play.
You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
How come?
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
Eleventh inning. What else?
You're not making sense.
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
I was educated by nuns.
Yes.
I think I remember.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
Oh. You know him.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
Engaging.
Say it again.
You know what.
Alla puttanesca.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
So do I. Over and over.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
Would you like to meet him?
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
The fact is, I have to get going.
Is what true?
He wears a disguise.
He's a very sweet man.
Where are you going now?
Home.
Someone waiting for you?
No one's waiting.
I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
Never mind.
I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
I'm going home to my machine.
They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
Yes -- I can't talk like this.
It is the work of untouchables.
All the more reason.
There's no room! And the air is lovely.
Eleven.
"I will follow close behind you and help to serve the people."
"I will follow you in all our vows and duties."
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
What do you expect when you talk like that?
I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
One more.
Going nearer to God!
I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
What was he like?
He said he's in charge...
No, no -- just a moment, please.
We must end the campaign.
You will respect the law.
There are unjust laws -- as there are unjust men.
I hope not.
A great deal.
An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.  We must stop.
There is nothing I can give.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
It's split the Government.
Well, that's one victory.
Thank you. No.
I dined at the prison.
Ahh.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
Oh!  Neither have I.  I'm awfully sorry.
No -- but I think I'm going to.
Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
Who are you trying to convince?
Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.
It would be five thousand more.
No?  What's keeping you?
I guess I'm a slow learner.
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
Something's not right.
He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.
Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
Where do we start?
We'll vacuum these streets if we have to.
Where did you get this?
What a relief.
This time I will supervise each test personally.
Jerome--?
Hello, sweatheart.  Come on up.
It's about the Director.
Again?
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
You have more in common than you know.
He's too tall.
Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
You had to be a right-hander.
Noone orders southpaws anymore.
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent.
The Mission Director.
You wish.
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
So what?  You didn't kill him, did you?
You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.
Keep going!!  Keep going!!
How long do you stay up there before you go?
You know I'm scared of heights.
It's okay, Eugene.
I'm proud of you, Vincent.
We can't stay here.
What are you talking about?
They think I offed the Director.
They found my eyelash.
Where?
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
I'm sure I could have.
If you say so.  The stripe.
Good choice.
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
Michael's.
You may as well invite her here.
Will you be okay?
Not bad, Jerome.
How the hell did you get here.
I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
No, but you might need them when you get back.
In case you get back before I do.
Where are you going?
I'm travelling too.
We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".
German, is that you?
Vincent, come down.  I've found him.
Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
There's a way.
You worried about the cost?
Not that.
No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
Yes.
Why would we do that?
We were just looking.
Friend?
They found an eyelash.
Where?
In the South Wing.
Does it have a name?
Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
You celebrate, Jerome?
You're angry--
You'll be next.
I guess somebody beat me to it.
Those checks take forever.
Let's walk.
Who are they?
Come on.
We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
We could go together one day.
Not so long--just once around the sun.
New policy.
There's a problem, Lamar.
I can't do this.
I'm not doing it.
Honey, you've made <i>one</i> mistake--
Antonio--
I heard about you. You work with Miller.
Stay clean.
Beynon.
News said two persons killed.
And you got him...
That's right.
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
No way. I always do my own work.
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
Hi.
You okay?
My license expired, let's get out of here.
I want to take a walk.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
I've been there every day for the last four years.
Small town, small bank, big money.
I've been doing my homework.
Just like old times?
Better than old times.
Where did you get them developed?
Assumed name... Houston.
Good.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
What do you want for dinner?
Whisky and a peach.
Just the way I remembered.
Fatter... some things never change.
Boring.
That's not all of it.
No. It's been a long time.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
I'm still here, Doc.
It's all right.
It's just been a while.
Really.
Better than I remembered.
Is he straight?
You got the parole, didn't you?
Yeah... I know.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
I didn't. I just waited.
Want to cry now?
Usually on the right side as you go in.
My mind's not on guessing games.
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
I mean it.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
I see it...
There are three men dead.
Do it my way.
Do it my way.
There wasn't any way to explain it.
You sent me to him.
She's on TV.
If you don't start telling the truth... 
We keep going.
And switched keys.
He must have.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
Sure?
I can handle it.
I'll bet you can.
I mean it.
Why, there's nothing on the news?
I didn't mean police.
I think you liked it with him.
When are you going to learn?
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
Let's do it.
El Paso.
Twenty eight hundred.
Not now.
No scars.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
Sure...
I don't want to hear it.
Listen to me. It's hard enough.
You want to try with me?
Things can't get much worse can they?
I don't see how.
That's all I want... It's the only thing I have ever wanted.
Yeah.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
Whatever you say.
Who was it?
Just get your clothes on...
Where do we go from here?
I don't know, airport I guess.
Pull over.
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
I guess we are.
We walk.
Yeah... I guess it does.
I never have any luck.
I really hope you have a nice trip.
Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
Gonna knock down a wall?
Might try that.
Chicago.
You were with him?
Yeah. I got out.
What about you?
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Okay. How many bank exits?
Two.
What about the vault?
I'm good at that.
What do you have in mind?
Right.
Then you do it.
Can't leave the desk.
Suit yourself.
Just fine.
Where we go in1?
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
Come on. How much?
'Bout five thousand.
That's what I want.
How about twenty thousand?
Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
Just... tell us what you want.
A Ford... We have a Ford.
You can trust him...
How long have you been married?
Two years.
That's what matters, isn't it?
I'll tell you when.
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
Yes.
How?
When did you find out?
A couple of weeks back.
How?
Nothing. What could I do?
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
Yes. I told him.
What did he say?
'Good.'
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
What happened to this car?
What's it got to do with you?
This is my brother's car.
Oh ay?
Yeah.
Was the steering faulty?
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
How'd it happen, then?
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
Well?
What?
I made a mistake.
What about?
Never mind.
Christ, what...
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
Good evening.
Confidential, like.
I can't Jack. How can I?
Yes you can.
Who sent you, Thorpey?
Brumby!
He's got a new place at Burnham.
Doreen.
Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
I want to talk to you later.
Tomorrow morning, then?
He was all right to me.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Nicer than most.
Though nicer than most?
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
Why'd you see him so regular?
Once a week?
I call that regular.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
What?
You know Sid Fletcher?
I work for him.
Do you?
Who?
Sid Fletcher.
Oh, do you?
Yes.
No, do you really?
Go on.
Really?
Yes, while he was here.
While he was here. You went about together?
He was here for four days.
Was he?
Could you do me a favour?
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
Could you please put my glass on the table?
So where are we going, Princess?
To the demon king's castle, of course.
Of course. Where else?
We're there now.
Is he coming here?
He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
What kind of entertaining?
Especially when I play the lead.
Sure I'm sure.
You've been watching the film.
Tell me about the girl.
What girl?
The young girl. Who pulled her?
I don't know.
Was it Albert?
Shouldn't think so.
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Who set it up?  Eric?
Yeah.
Did my brother Frank find out?
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
And you didn't know her last name?
Nice of you to come.
No. Frank was a good bloke.
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
No. It's all right.
Thanks for coming.
Yeah.
They said he was drunk.
I left last year.
Oh, what you doing now?
Working at Woolworths.
That must be interesting.
Yes.
Yeah.
You coming to South America?
No.
At me friend's house.
Where's that?
Wilton Estate.
At the Half Moon.
That's what I was wondering.
Since when did he drink whisky?
Don't know.
Yes.
Where would I find him?
Today? At the races. He always goes.
Large Scotch.
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
That's what he was saying about you.
Good lad.
Where you off to?
Las Vegas.
Four of them.
Cliff Brumby. Ever been to Westsea?
How'd you find me?
No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
I'm staying with a friend.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
It's not like that, luv.
It never is.
Definitely.
Will this do?
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
My brother, Frank.
Is he staying the night?
Funny.  Can I phone London?
It'll cost you.
You don't look it.
No. Really, I am.
Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
No, you won't.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it.
Ta-ra.
They came back?
No.
Don't ask me.
You're lucky. They kill as well.
And what about you? Did you kill Brumby?
That little shit!
What about Keith?
What about Keith?
What you going to do?
Pension him off.
You're a bastard.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
What's that supposed to mean?
Think about it.
No.
Do you want breakfast?
Yes, thank you.
No. I'm not tired,  Do you eat breakfast?
What, and get myself beaten up again?
No chance of that.
Not much.
They're friends of mine.
And that'll make me feel better?
I don't want to get rough, do I?
How could I stay away?
Jack Carter.
Eric. Eric Paice.
What you doing around here then?
Didn't you know this is my home town?
No, I didn't know that.
Funny, that.
No. I'm visiting relatives.
Oh, that's nice.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
That's all right, Eric.
Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Oh, you've been watching television.
Yeah,  Come off it, Eric. Who is it?
That's not always a healthy way to be...
And you should know, if I remember rightly.
Still got a sense of humour?
Still got your sense of humour.
Piss off, Ray.
Nasty way to go.
Yes.
I have to. Things to see to.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
He said it'd be doing him a big favour.
Shut up.
They do that up North.
Knock it off, Gerald.
What? And get the clap?
That's right, Harry.
Your hundred, and another hundred.
Three hundred altogether, Harry.
Ha.
That's right.
You're not seeing me?
...Polacks...
Deadbeats all.
...they hold on to their money...
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
Where am I going to work?
You had to, yeah.  Why?
To get on the...
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
You ever get 'em?
Well, I think I had one once.
I...I don't know.
Well, they fucked it up.
They killed the goose.
They did.
And now...
We're stuck with this...
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
...this shit...
It's too...
It is.
It's too...
Some contest board...
I...
It's not right.
No.
Eh...?
That's right?
Eh?
No.  That's absolutely right.
...cower in his boots...
He's doing very well.
Yes.
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
Starting up.
What hard part?
Just the act.
You...
You...
You build it!
That's what I...
You fucking build it!  Men come...
Men come work for you...
They...
They have...
When they...
What do you mean?
Yes...?
Yes.
How?
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
You haven't talked to him.
We're just "talking" about it.
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
Yes.
Talking about it as a...
No.
As a robbery.
Well.  Well...
Hey.
No.  Not actually.
Did you?
What did you say?
That's right.
Have I said that?
Is that what I said?
What did he say?
What did he say?  He'd buy them.
What will he pay?
A buck a shot.
For five thousand?
Is that what I said?
He'd give me a job.
He would take you on.  Yes.
What?  What?  The leads.
You have to steal the leads tonight?
I'm sorry?
You.
I...
Yes.
What does that mean?
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
Why would they come to me?
They're going to come to everyone.
Why would I do it?
Are you sure?
Yes.  I'm sure.
...and rob the place...
...I thought that we were only talking...
Absolutely.
That's ridiculous.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?
In the abstract...
So I'm making it concrete.
Do you need five grand?
Is that what I just said?
You need money?  Is that the...
Yes.
Because you listened.
How ya doing?
Uh-huh.
What do you care...?
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
Huh?
Yes.  They are old.
They're ancient.
Clear...
Clear Meadows.  That shit's dead.
It's a waste of time.
That's...
Everything I...you know...
They stole the...
To the cops?
Yeah.
A waste of time?  Why?
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
Yes.  The cops.  No.
They aren't?
No.
Why don't you think so?
Where was I?
Yes.
Yes.
No.
You have nothing to hide.
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
Yeah.  You know who doesn't?
No, who?
Thieves.
Why?
They're inured to it.
You think so?
Yes.
Where did Moss...?  I...
Will you excuse us please?
You understand?
Did they catch...?
I'll be at the restaurant. </pre> </html>
Fuck.  I had them on River Glen.
You...
That's great.
Thank you, George.
We had a robbery. 
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
I didn't rob...
In school.
That's right.  You want to go out today...?
I want to work today, that's why I came...
The leads come in, I'll let...
Just go to lunch.
I don't want to go to lunch.
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
Excuse me, sir...
...did they...
Would you excuse us, please...?
You call them again.  Mr. Williamson...!
You're done, come down, and let's...
Would you come in here, please?
What two?
...then...
...I only...
Under him?
Moss.
...you talk to Murray...
Yes.  I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.
...let me...are you listening to me...?
John.  John...
I'm out.
Yes.
The leads are assigned randomly...
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
Then put me on the board.
You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
And what if you don't close.
I will close.
And fifty bucks a lead.
Good.  Now we're talking.
Now.  Yes...When?
Because I say so.
Somebody broke in.
Get 'em to me!
Yes, I am.
What are you trying to tell me?
What are you talking about?
No.  It hadn't.
You robbed the office.
Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
Who kept the other half?
That was easy, wasn't it?
Was it?
Abso...
Forget it.  Frame it.  It's worthless.
Call up the bank.  I called them.
Why?
Because I don't like you.
Fuck you.
Eighty-two thousand dollars.
Hey, I don't want to hear your fucking war stories...
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
"Bruce, Harriet...Fuck me, believe in yourself..."
And did they steal the contracts...?
Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
That's right.
Shelly...!
They took the phones...
They...
Last night, this morning.
Mmm.
Guess who?
"I want to tell you something, Harriet..."
From the store.
Fuck her...
Kenilw...
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
My wife told me to look into...
Home...
Home cooking...
The monthly interview...?
Oh!  For the magazine...
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...
Kenilworth...?
I'm sorry...?
Kenilworth.
Yeah.
Mm.
I think I'd better stay here for a while.
Yes.
I don't know.
Yes.
To...you know.
To change our minds.
Of course you have three days.
But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...
Three business days.  They mean three business days.
I don't understand.
I'm not.
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
If we wait till Mon...
When did you write the check?
What was yesterday?
Tuesday.
I don't know.
It's not me, it's my wife.
What is?
I told you.
Tell me again.
Tell me again.  Your wife.
She wants her money back.
We're going to speak to her.
We'll speak to her, Jim...
She won't listen.
No, Jim.
That...
What...?
I...
What...?  Say the words.
The power to negotiate.
To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?
What, "this"?
She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...
And the check is...
It's nothing.
What are the police doing here...?
Not to my knowledge, no...
Fuck the Machine.
Mountain View.  Eight units.
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
Eight units.  Mountain View.
You did that?
Guess who?
When...
Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
They took 'em...
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
I'm going home.
Your farewell to the troops?
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
Have a good trip.
They--excuse me...
Did they...
They got, listen to me...
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
Yes.
You did?
Yes.
Aren't you going out today?
With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
I have the stuff from last year's...
I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift.
I'm giving you three leads.  You...
Three.
Yes.  Please.  Please.  The police  can be...
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
Did you like your party?
I got lots of presents.
Do you like them?
No, where is it?
I know.  How long will you be gone?
Just a few days.
Will you take me?
To do business.
I can help you.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
At first, like everybody, I was a soldier.
Oh yes, the very best.
She couldn't decide.
 He's going to kill Fanucci.
How are the kids?
Bought at the airport.
Why do you come to me?  Why don't you go to a travel agent?
Then why do you come to me?
Because I need MONEY!
No.
The children can stay.
A hundred years...it's a toast.
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
These Eye-ties are really crazy when it comes to their wives.
I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns!
Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
You would risk your life for strangers?
Not for strangers; for my country.
He is weak.
He will grow strong.
The child cannot harm you.
Let's go.
Forget it, just go take care of her.
Mio fratello.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
We're making an investment in Havana.
I never met them.
That's what I'm here for.
Wait'll you see!
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
It was hard to have him killed.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
No.  I mean, are you sure?
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
The old man will never bring in the New Year.
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
I know they get Pentangeli, that's all I know.
A pig of a Neaponitan. 
Beautiful.
I know.  That's why I brought you with me!
Chi?
Within the compound will be fine.
I'm going to see my parents.
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
Am I a prisoner?
That's not the way we look at it.
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
I can feel it in the way he talks to me.
She's gone, Tom.
I don't know.
Yeah, give me a minute.
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
If I'm wrong...
I took care of it.
What was it, so I'll know.
Wait... there's something else.
Alright.
Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
Mike, at three and a half...
And Kay...she's all right?
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
I want it met.
Twenty-five this time.
Mike wants it.
No questions.
How do I know you haven't gone into business for yourself?
The room has a bug in it.
I'd like to go outside with him, in the open air.
Did my brother go back?
Yeah, but don't worry.
Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to dinner.  Just wanted to go home.
Tom, what do I do now?
Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.
Do you owe markers?
Maybe two, three thousand dollars.
Our mistake.  But what does it matter; it was our money.  We don't even expect thanks.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
Is he related to the witness?
He is, I believe, a brother.
This meeting is adjourned.
This committee owes an apology!
The committee is adjourned until further notice.
Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.
Sleeping inside me.
Does it feel like a boy?
Yes, Michael, it does.
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
His brother came to help him.
Goodbye, Michael.
You haven't heard me.
Who's asking?
Where can we talk?
Right here.
You said you were Klingman.
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
There are still things I have to do.
No, I meant lose his family.
Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
Of course you must keep control of your family.
It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
So, that occurred to me.
Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.
How is his health?
Not good.
After dinner.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
Says who?
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
He did business...but he never trusted him.
I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
Trust me; do as I ask.
All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.
It's important.
No, she's here.
Sitting right behind you.
We worked it all out beforehand.
Are we going to eat or what?
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
Don't I look like I'm listening?
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
What if I say shove it?
We got no choice.
I'm talking about Italians!
What about Michael Corleone?
He supports me.
Maybe, yes... maybe no.
Eh...  Five dollars more.
In fact, reduced, bu five dollars!
I won't keep you another minute...
Just thinking out loud.
Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
Weird.
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
I didn't mean to...
Sure.  I loved it.
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
The Master is waiting for you.
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
I'm not married.
Why?
A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
Of course.  I am married still.
He is dead now, twenty years.
Then you're as single as I am.
Yes!  You know?
Well...no, not really --
You and he are not doing things?
Yes.  I trust you.
What do I do?
I put him to bed.  He's not there?
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
But I didn't do this!
Mornin'.
And your name is --?
The Marines.  Good for you.  You must have served in Korea.
No.  Iced tea's fine.
Splendid.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
Nothing serious.  A touch of stroke.
You mean, like posed for pictures?
What's to sketch?
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
Football in college.
You went to university?
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone.  I can assure you of that.
Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.
"Bride of Frankenstein."
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
That's exactly what I intend to do.
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
Go ahead.
This David's a friend?
I liked it.  We all did.
Did anyone laugh?
No.
I don't like to talk about that.
All righty.  I understand.
No.  At least not in the legal sense.
Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
I never thought you were.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
Of course.  I don't want to scare you off.  Not before I'm finished with you.
Why not?
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
Oh no.  I never swim.
Everybody has stories to tell.
Not me.
I told you.  I don't like to talk about that.
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
I was an officer.
Of course I remember.  Do you think I'm so senile --
Do I look okay?
If that's okay?
Nothing would please me more.
I don't hear anything.
Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
Neither of us really belongs here.
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
Monsters?  The only monsters...  ...are here.
Can't you see?  It's raining!
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.  I believe I promised you some clothes.
You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
Very sporting of you, Clayton.
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
But you said --
That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.
Not at all.
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
James Whale.  This afternoon at the party.
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
Your friend?
You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.
You are much too human.
What did you expect?  Bronze?
Don't move.
There are straps in back.
What was that?
It's too tight.
Did I hurt you?
Nothing I didn't deserve.
Need some help?
Pray you, undo this button.
All right.
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
Fuck off!
You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
I think I'll hang around.
Have a drink?
I just want to watch it, okay?
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
You remember how a production eats up one's life.
Goodbye, Hanna.
I was, until last night.  Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for today's reception.
Oh, David, stop being a nanny.
You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
No.  I never could.  You must regret having had the invitation sent.
Then who did?
Boris?  Do I look a fright?
Elsa?
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Don't be daft.  It's just a student from the university.
Yes?
Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black.
She is beautiful.
I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
Good night.
Of course.  This afternoon.
A visitor.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
No.  But someone you can talk to.
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
Of course.  How is the old boy these days?
It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
I know.  People's movies aren't their lives.
Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
Everything.  Start at the beginning.
No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
Quite.
Then the rumors are true?
What rumors might those be?
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Will you tell me everything you remember about making "Frankenstein"?
Of course.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Righto.  Let me see.
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
Don't go away.
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
Splendid.  Now that I know you're around.
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
Six years ...
A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
Who do you think?

Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
She soars -
Not really -
Excuse me --
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --
Checkin' it out
Shit all looks the same here --

Son of a bitch. Get over here.
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
No. No. The guy from downtown.
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
Anybody!  You understand?
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
You treated me like shit.
They don't feel like you're in construction.
What are you gonna do?
Get inside!
What bag?
That again.
What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.
What are you talking about?
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
Hello!  Hello!  Have a good flight?
What did he say, exactly?
Just get me out.
What are you talking about?
You know. The stuff I left.
I flushed it down the toilet.
You what?
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
I got seared.
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
I got scared.
Yeah. What about the kids' school?
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
We only have to shove'em over the moat.
I gotta talk to you.
Have a drink first.
There are cops all over the place.
So what?  Where are they gonna go?
Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
Nah.
I better call again.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
He heard.
I can't make any more deliveries.
My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.
They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
So do I.
Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?
He's okay. They sobered him up.
Did he say what they're asking him about?
He's with his friends.
What kind of person doesn't call?
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
Look. He's got the whole house in an uproar.
We'll pick it up.
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
Please?
That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.
Suck my cock!
Oh, Morgan!
All right, then.
Watch what happens.
Oh great, tell her that! Now she really thinks we're problem drinkers!
We're not goin'.  I don't even like "Kelly's."
Jesus Christ. Not even close.
I don't know yet.
Next week.
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
You're fuckin' good.
No one. I didn't have the number.
I don't know.
What do I look like, Al Cowlins?  You want to take my car, drop her off?
Gone.
What?
Some shows are worth the price of admission, partner.
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
It's a way outta here.
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
No, I had to talk him down.
Why didn't you yoke him?
Ah, history I think.
How you doin'?
Good.
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
This is your house, right?
You could put a pool in that backyard.
What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
How much money you got?
I told you, I just got change.
I think you should establish a good line of credit.
Shut up.
I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'.
Yah, that was different. Management was restructurin'--
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
I don't have a VCR at my house.
Shut the fuck up.
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
I have about seventy-three...
Will you take a check?
Good, it was all right.
And what do you see?
Somethin's in my room.
What is it?
It's touching me.
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
You don't have to be nervous, Will.
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
Yeah, can I help you?
Well, he didn't show up for work today...
What're you doing?
I'm sorry.
Well... I'll be speaking to your supervisor.
Fuck do you want?
Yes. Under two conditions.
What're those?
Okay. How?
It's an integer proof.
I happen to know so.
Half-red, half-black--
--that?--
--Half-red, half-black--
--That edge!
An integer.
C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
I don't know what it's called.
It's right.  Take it home with you.
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving.
Hey, how you doin'?
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
Yes.
Who proved the theorem.
Pleasure to meet you.
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
Yeah, cured polio.
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
So who won the bet?
I did.
Good to see you.
Is there someplace we can talk?
I've been busy.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
I got your card.
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
My kind of background?
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
Just meet with the boy once a week.
Can we do it at my office?
That would be fine.
It's on the college.
I'll be okay.
Tom.
You too, Gerry.
Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
Not at all.
You moved?
I been here a couple years.
I think so.
What don't I understand?
Who?
Well, you're the only one.
Now wait a minute, Gerry--
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
--And confuse him--
--Gerry--
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
Come in.
Sean...
Me too.
I don't know. India maybe.
Never been.
You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
Sounds good.
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
What do you want to do?
There is somebody...
Who is he?
He was my roommate in college.
You guys are fuckin' sick.
Let's hit "Kelly's."
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
Had one, now I'm fucked again.
Will, your not getting off that easy.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
What did you think?
Yeah, it did take me a long time.
Whatever blows your hair back.
You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
Nautilus?
Oh.
No.
Crayons?
Tell me what you really think.
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
--Well, maybe that means you.
Maybe what mea--
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
Watch your mouth.
You've never been out of Boston.
Yeah, I went on a date last week.
Fine.
I don't know.
Why not?
Haven't called her.
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
My wife's dead.
Hence, the word remarried.
My wife's dead.
Why not?
What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?
They could see that I meant it.
You're kiddin' me.
Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
Gerry says the meeting went well.
What did you think?
What did I think?
What?
Define that.
Not to me, they're not.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
Don't give me you line of shit.
I didn't want the job.
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
--No, have you had any experience with that?
It sure ain't good.
Cause fuck him, that's why.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
Don't fuck with me.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not...
Yeah, I think so.
Good for you. Congratulations.
Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
We're done. You did your time. You're a free man.
You're Welcome, Will.
I'll keep in touch.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
Only if you grab my ass.
Here's my number.
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
So you just want to use me and go?
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
Yes you were.
Then why don't we just get it out of the way.
Not far from here, South Boston.
How was that?
Pretty boring, I guess.
You know, nothing special.
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Not a chance.
Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.
I swear to God.
Your house must have been a zoo.
'Course I do, they're my brothers.
We'll do that.
I'm sorry, I been real busy.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
If you bring the caramels.
How the hell did you do that?
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
I've never seen your place.
I think I can make it to South Boston.
Aah, it's kind of a hike.
Fine.
Some, a little.
Just for fun?
I guess so.
Come one Will. I just want to know.
--When it came to stuff like that I could always just play.
No.
Come with me to California.
What?
How do you know that?
I know. I just do.
Yeah, but how do you know?
I don't know. I just feel it.
And you're sure about that?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Why not?
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
Then what are you afraid of?
What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
What about your twelve brothers?
No, you don't want to hear that.
Yes, I do, Will.
Goodbye.
Well, I'm contracting the land.
I never knowed they was anything like her!
Let 'er go, Gallagher!
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
I'll get Rosasharn.
Don't hold me so tight.
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
You're *ticklin' me!*
Now I can't breathe.
Naw. They paroled me.
Oh.
People done it. If they could, we could.
Lots must a died, too.
Well, we ain't out a it yet.
Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.
Fan-belt's shot.
Gallon or two?
She got to make it.
Okay. Go on.
What's it to you?
Them was nickel apiece candy.
Joad.
How many men?
Four.
Women?
Two.
Kids?
Can all of you work?
Why, I guess so.
Two and a half cents.
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
Got a warrant?
How many of you?
An' you say no cops?
No cop can come in here without a warrant.
Government.
*You* find out, I can't.
Anything like work aroun' here?
Crate fell on me.
Yeah. On my way home now.
I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
No, I never. What?
I been in the penitentiary for four years. 
Excuse me for asking.
Shore it is. It always is, this time a year.
Just around that next bend.
They never wrote you nothing?
No. They wasn't people to write.
What you figger to do?
Casy! What you doin' here?
Thought you was in jail.
But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
Lissen, I heard that before--
Sure do.
*Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
Yeah.
Get to what?
I stay in my own yard.
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
I didn't mean nothing.
That's where I get off.
What you mean?
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
Sure. We made a buck since midday.
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
Didn' you have no breakfast?
Take her with you!
California.
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
Got any plants?
No plants.
Sure. We aim to.
Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
You mean I can't even get outa here?
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
But will it--hurt the baby?
This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.
No'm.
Stand by the door.
No--an' look what I got for you.
Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
She'll be awright.
Sometimes they do.
I'm ready.
That's right. And douse some in it.
Ya say we're acrost?
Look, Ma!
Didn' you get no sleep?
No.
Was Granma bad?
Granma's dead.
When?
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
They know he got hit in the face.
Don't know--but it's better'n this.
Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
Good-by, Tommy.
This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
Go ahead--Bert says take it.
There, them stripy ones.
They gone.
That's what I asked you, ain't it?
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
It ain't nobody. It's a company.
California, here we come!
Give 'im a fryin' pan. 
We gonna stay, ain't we?
We gonna take whatever they got.
I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off.
Maybe he'll be back. We'll leave word for him. Jus' don't cry. 
I wisht it was day.
Won't they ketch us?
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!
Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?
I seen 'em b'fore you did.
What's this?
Now don't you go monk'ing--
Morning.
You people looking for work?
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
Can you pick peaches?
We can pick anything.
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
You ain't to hurt them fellas.
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yes I do.
You don't...
In the corporate offices.
Oh... really?
Yeah...
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
It's what I do.
You're so funny...
I'm Martin Blank.
Don't say that.
Whatever I can get away with.
What?
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
Computer guy.
What?
Really...? So what?
Okay. See you later.
Fine, Bob. How are you?
Really?
What do you want to do?
Overflowing with love.
It's nice to see you again.
Not much else.
What's your business?
I'm a professional killer.
Professional killer. Do you get dental with that?
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
Yep.
Well, there's not much to tell.
You met people.
Bad people.
Bad television.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
Unbelievable.
Seven it is.
Yes.
As long as I get the laugh.
Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.
Okay... Hold on...
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
What?
Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
Like love?
Not the other way around...?
No.
It's something I do...
Get the fuck outta here.
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
You never could have kept this from me.
That's probably a good idea.
I'm staying here.
What if I come back?
I'll hide.
Tell me about your vision of the reunion.
I just know.
Say more.
Mmm.
Out Loud?
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
It's only natural....
Like a club. Work less, make more.
Thank you, no.
A little misunderstanding among my associates.
Hard to get good help these days.
Excellent. Here they come.
Hello Martin. How have you been?
Not bad. You?
Hey, Bob.
That sounds pretty interesting...
Those all seem kind of related...
Nope.
In Portugal, yes.
It was the PLO.
Whatever.
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
He using her.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
One cannot love and kill.
I love. I kill.
If he does our job, he's our job.
Patch him through....
This?
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
I'll pay.
They blame you for the compromise.
And they want me to make up for it.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.
Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one.
Never enough.
I'll do it tomorrow.
It's fine.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
I've looked at it.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
That's wonderful, Mom.
What's a revival tent?
It's a place where religious people--
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
Jim?
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
Nature made him then broke the mold.
I have a headache. You have a headache?
No, I don't have one.
You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
Yeah. I guess we did.
Of course you will.
I have always thought about her and missed her.
Paul?
You're leaving me hanging here...
You too.
No. You drove us here.
He sold me this bad boy.
Mein Dealer.
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
As long as you had a good time.
That's too bad.
How did you get this job?
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
How are you? How's business?
That's good.
I am very sorry, ma'am. Goodbye now.
You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
It is cocktail hour yet?
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
You lived in Chicago?
You were married to a woman in Chicago?
Just who's been laughing at who here?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
I don't sleep all right anywhere. But the house is fine.
I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
You too.
Need a lift?
I can handle it!
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
Feel good?
Five years. My son was born here.
I am comfortable.
Huh?
Tom.
Ssshhh...  Stand still, Annie. Takes what we've got, just for now. Can you do that?
Annie!
One more time.
How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
I brought it to you in the hospital.
What about him?
Yeah?
Whatever you want.
Fine!
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
I didn't know I had to.
I don't care.
I don't care.
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
Then why do you want to leave?
Little.
Don't they believe in signs here?
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
I think they call it a pasture.
You already did.
No. I just thought... forget it.
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
I'll take care of it.
Did you go riding?
Well...  So you tried riding again?
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
My period.
When? Tonight?
What?... Oh baby...
Why should they?
So do you.
How's everything?
Good.
Hi.
Go ahead...
Who's there?
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
Did you speak to Farlow?
Yes. We're suing.
All right. Speak to you then.
Hi.
Hi.
I should be in by two.
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
Sure... What's Grace up to?
Riding with Judith.
Tch. What are you --
Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
No, let me go.
The funeral's on Friday.
Oh. Right. I'll call him.
I love you.
Do you? Do you really?
Doing what?
What did he say?
No.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
She will if you think she should.
And you think it's best if I don't come.
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
I know. We miss you too.
Good night.
Huh-huh. You?
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
Let's not talk about that now.
Yeah, what?
Take your time.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Tubab means white man.
You want to take a walk with me?
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
No. He had the choice.
What choice!!?
Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah.
What was it like?
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
Yes, it does.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
You too, Diane.
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
Well, of course, right...
- See, what you can do for him --...
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
What?
It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?
There's a kid at school says we should've imprint-trained him.
Weekend after next...
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
You know her?
Yeah.
And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
Because it fits my head. You want to try it on?
Have you talked to Tom about it?
Of course I have.
You know, you're a good kid.
She's an editor.
Mmm. An editor.
You're catching on.
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
It's never too soon to start.
I don't have all day.
Well, there's only one way to find out.  Give it a little gas.
Sure.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
I thought your mom's coming up?
I just could never say it!
Why don't we just cut through the woods?
I'm okay... I'm okay.
How's Pilgrim doing?
OK, OK.
No, I'm just not that hungry.
Maybe... look -- just...
I want to see Pilgrim.
I know. Amazing.
Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom?
YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
You just showing off for her!
You shut up, stupid!
We still have a way to go.
How much longer do you think?
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck.
How long were you married?
Does a horse miss a saddle?
What stuff is that?
Cool?
Yeah, cool.
You think it's cool?
It's cool!
Don't move!
Hack the Planet!
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait!
Waste the dude.
Devil book. The Unix Bible.
Dragon book. Compiler design.
Shh!
The sensitive type.
Super hero like even.
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Looks like a hacker wrote it.
Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!
Yo, brain dead, the manual!
...as they snoop onto us.
Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?
Do you think he could hack a Gibson?
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Difficulty rating?
Yeah?
Go fix the phones.
Roger.
Curtis.
And what's he do?
Yeah, mom?
Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy birthday.
Up all night again, huh?
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!
Hmmm.
No. No one special.
I told you, I don't play well with others.
Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a file.
Give it up! Just give it up.
This is the end, my friend.  Thank you for calling!
Never heard of you. Done anything?
What's going on?
Razor and Blade.
What's this one eat?
It nibbles. You see this?
Joey's getting stupid busy.
We did it!
No, you're not in my class.
I'll give it a shot.
Pool on the roof must have a leak.
I said give me time.
He's not enrolled in this class.
I'm Crash Override.
It's cool, I'm just looking.
It's too much machine for you.
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Yeah. RISC is good.
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
Are you challenging me?
Name your stakes.
Make it my first born.
Make it our first date.
You're not gonna win.
And you have to smile.
Okay. I'll copy it.
Okay, thank you.
Uh, hold on...
I have to tell you something.
I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
I'll make it up to you!
I'll hack the Gibson.
It's my subway defense system.
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
They're elite! Let's get 'em.
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
Yeah.
Alright, let's boot up.
Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
I'm trying to help you.
What?
Yeah.
You would have looked better.
Wanna go for a swim?
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
I think we've got something.
Good.
Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?
My name is the Plague.
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
Let's echo 23, see what's up.
Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!
Joey, Joey...
What? whatwhatwhat?
You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
Love, secret, and uh, sex.  But not in that order, necessarily, right?
I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
Hey, it's me.
Phreak?
Virus?
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
Sh, sh sh sh sh.
You said the worm was untreaceable!
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me.
Nonono, thank YOU!
555-4202.
Just one moment.
Thank you.
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
I'll take you down there.
All right.
So?
When did you find this out?
This morning.
I'm not angry it's just
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
I don't know Brady.
Okay, I guess. I'll call you later.
You don't owe me anything.
No, you don't understand.
We've been better.
What's going on?
Michael Myers.
Who's that?
10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
Look.
I don't know!
We're trapped in this house.
Get back!
Brady!
Brady! Come with us.
Go!
Brady!
Get up there Rachel!
Get up there Rachel!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
Go!
Yes, sir.
Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
Its too late.
You guys always look great.
I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.
Because the lights are all out.
About what?
I've said this before. I think your the one who needs medical help.
How many people in the bus?
How many bodies did you find?
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
Has he been prepped?
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
Outside.
Check him out.
Yeah.  Well I guess your happy to see him go.
Drive Carefully.
Okay, out.
I can't sleep.
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
Like a real sister?
Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
In a second.
It was the nightmare man
What?
Coming.
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
This is great Rachel. Come on.
Forget it kido. We're home by eight o'clock.
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
Oh Rachel!
No.
Come on.
Well try dammit!
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
Then we'll be safe?
Yeah.
Just do it.
Hi Jamie.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
I don't want to look pushy.
You won't look pushy.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Okay, bye.
Its not over yet.
Where are you going?
The state police won't know how to stop him.
You look sharp. You understand?
No problem, Sheriff.
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
Go get it.
What are we doing?
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
If you'd seen that police station you wouldn't even ask.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
He's here, Sheriff.
Why?
He's been here.
How do you know?
Dear God.
They didn't know what they were fighting.
Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
Be here in a minute.
They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.
Sort of.
What's going on?
Now you understand?
Uh huh.
Don't touch him Jamie!
Hi, Dad. What happened?
What?
You blame everything on kids.
He shouts, too.
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
That's not true. Here I am.
We just talked.
Sure.
Fun-ny. See you.
I forgot my chemistry book.
Look where?
Behind that bush there.
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
Annie, was that you?
Of course.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
Bye.
I wasn't spooked.
Lies.
He was watching me.
That's probably all he can do.
You guys will make a fabulous couple.
Yes, you can.
Here, Lester.
I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
I want to stay here and watch this.
Come with me.
Just answer the damn phone.
Yeah.
Want a beer?
Yeah.
Is that all you say?
Yeah.
Go get me a beer.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
Michael's around someplace...
Will you call me tomorrow?
Promise?
Yeah.
Lee Brackett.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
He isn't a man.
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
You all right?
Sure...
I found the car! He's here!
It's your own fault and I don't feel sorry for you.
I don't think so...
Have a good time.
Hi, Tommy.
Same time, same place.
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
Just watch.
But king Arthur was always your favorite.
Why are they under there?
Mom doesn't like me to have them.
After the movie.
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
There was no one outside.
There WAS.
What did he look like?
I promise.
I saw him...
Tommy, let me in!
What is it, Laurie?
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
HURRY!
Yes.
How?
I killed him...
But you can't kill the bogyman.
No! Do as I say.
Will you get her for me?
She's washing her clothes.
Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
Of course not.
I've given them his profile.
There's nothing else I can do.
I'm wasting time.
Thorazin.
That's the idea. Here we are.
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
Only minimum security.
I see.
What does that mean?
It means... I see.
Shouldn't we pick him up?
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."
Mm-mm!
Come in, come in.
I can't believe it!
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's.  I do the, uh, crpes caviar.
Oh.
Are you really interested?
Yeah.
You want to see some?
Oh, yeah.
Well, let's do it.
Great.
Look at this.
Uh --
Great.
I mean, I've looked everywhere.
Oh, it's magnificent!
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
It's really terrible.
Okay.
Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
I mean, it's jammed.  If we went... um...
No, he called late last night.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
And you, you-you're going?
No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.
Hmm?
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
Is this your first job?
Really?  Is the food that bad?
Oh no.  Not at all.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
I'm an architect.
It's terrific!
And it ruins everything else.
It does.
Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
This time I really think I have something.
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
Let's take a look.
When did you first notice this?
It's nothing.  Will you trust me?
Yeah.  It's kind of a weird place, actually.  A lotta wall space. 
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Hi.
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
Ed Smythe, yes.
Could you--
...with the affiliates.
Yes, but you name names.
...cannot go on the air.
I don't know exactly.
Oh, Elliot!
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Oh, what, in this section of town?
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
You're out looking here?
How about you?
Oh.  Well, I live--
Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
Where are you headed?
Yeah, you would.
Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
No?
Uh, yes!
Yes?
Everything's okay? 
I'm...all right.
How-how's Frederick?
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
Oh, that's nice.  I'd love to see her wind up settled.  She's a tense one. 
Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
What are you doing?!
Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
Why, you know the situation.
What do you expect me to say?
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
But not over me?
Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
I almost didn't.
Lee... uh...
No, no-no-no, I'm sure.
I know it isn't.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
Oh, all the time.
Is something wrong?
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
I care a great deal about him, yes.
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
I know.
That's where your talent lies.
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
But, you got four children!
I want one with you.
No!
Are you in love with someone else?
Get his wine away.
I am glad to see you.
Always.
Oh, honey!
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
So?
That thought doesn't terrify you?
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!
How do you know?
Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
No, thank you.
No, nothing.
Absolutely.
Hmm?
Yeah.
Based on what?  You never even see him.
They're in the basement.
I can't take this anymore.
Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!
Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
What are you going to use for money?!
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
Oh, yes, you have!
You've been with someone!
Stop accusing me!
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
You know... 
Yeah?
Hello?
Like-- 
I can't keep my mind on the show.
But there's nothing wrong with you.
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything...
You've outdone yourself.
You look so beautiful.
Come on.
Doesn't she look pretty?
I bumped into your...
Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
Oh, me, I'm okay.
Do you miss Frederick?
No.
I'm okay.
Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
Oh, now-- 
Yeah.  I'll get some ice.
I know...I know.
Glad you could put in an appearance.
I got two minutes.
Very good.
Here, you guys.  Open them up.
Yeah?
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
You know, he's been wanting a mitt.
Mh-hm.
That's a beauty!
Isn't that great?
Oh!
Go right over there.
Football!
Is there no chance?
Hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies?  Jesus!
What are you talking about?
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
Just think about it.  That's all I ask.
...from Mavis, also.
He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
No, no, we decided!
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts.
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
I know.  H-how much do you need?
Uh-oh.
She really does, though.
When does Frederick ever come with her?
Oh, your kids are so adorable.
It's, uh, you never know--
He's such a loser!
He's not a loser at all!
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Here.  Be careful with those.
Oh!
Oooo.
Yeah, can you believe it?
No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
You know.
I know, no--  I know.
Easily.
I hope.
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
Tch, well, I sing!  For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!
So what's new?
You got it.
You're too demanding.
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
I'm real upset about what you wrote.
Oh, so loosely.
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy!  The room's alive with positive vibrations!
You want some?
No!
My--uh...
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
God!
Yes, you do recall, right?
I recall you.
Good.  How are you?
I'm fine.
You look wonderful.
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
It was a terrible evening.
Yeah, it was.
...in a really horrible way.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
Well, I hope you've changed.
I'm okay.
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
Well...
Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?
No, well...I've been trying to write.
Yeah.
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
No, you can tell me.
Come on.
No, I am.  I am.
Really?
You've always hated my taste in the past.
You have.
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
Oh, well.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Hi.  How you doin'?
When'd you get here?
Oh.  You look so beautiful.
Mmm, what?
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
Oh...
...which I did not get.
Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
Uh-huh.
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?
...you don't have to think.
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
I'm going to tell you later....
A reward for what?
Some museum director disappeared.
And?
They're offering... 
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
...<u>please</u>...
I <u>swear</u> to you...
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
I hereby acknowledge that...
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
It wasn't my day.
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
...how are things at the Hospital?
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
Yes, I presumed it was about him.
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
That would adversely impact my income.
...aren't you afraid of me...?
You want me to be?
I'd prefer it...  But it's just a vacant exercise.
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
...they did it for a lark.
Oh, Good.  The ornithological leitmotif...
Rich, comic book freaks.
And why is it a vacant exercise?
Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
Who would that be.
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
And have <u>you</u> found Peace..? 
All y'got to do is <u>ask</u>... 
I'm not.
That's what <u>you</u> think...
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
...the whole world's out to get you...
M'I gonna see you tonight?
That's right.
Then I'm doing fine.
What's new onna street?
...these guy'll back you up.
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
What's up...?
Their family owns...
Impossible.
...what a world.
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
First things first.
You take this much time over everything?
That's why my wife adores me.
Why did he come back?
...Let's see the pigs, please.
Somewhere in Italy.
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
Have the child taken to bed.
No.  And...
I like Popcorn...
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
You give me whatever I want...?
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
...they're from Baltimore....
I've never heard that he...
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
Exactly.
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
Try Barney Clark.
He is...?
And how would you know that?
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
No, no, of course not.
Tell him to give it to an orphanage.
...here's to child abuse!
Mmm...
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
Yes, I did.
....what...? 
Let the girl go.
Why?
For a consideration.
'fraid it's too late.
Shut up, Starling...
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
 He once made me an improper suggestion.
You seen John Brigham...?
A fellow with five fingers.
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
Reinstatement to <u>what</u>?  There ain't nobody there...
...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
What is that supposed to mean...?
I think its meaning is clear.
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
That could be.
I'm an orphan.
I said sometime it gets so...
How's your <u>child</u>?
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
Waal...
'bout time you <u>learned</u>...
You know it?
I have had many excellent meals there.
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
...should love to correct your error. 
Well, perhaps sometime we...
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
That, that was <u>business</u>...
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
I'll have them picked up.
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
My scar is a war-wound.
The commissioner is going round the Cafe...
Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?
...yes, yes, yes...
Yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. I won't be a minute...
Where do you live?
With Mama and Shirley and Stringbean.
Yes.... yes...
Oh, no, no.  It won't be <u>that</u> long.
Sir, with all due respect....
Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
Thank you, that's not responsive.  How did our Miss Drumgo get...
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
I realize, you're under a lot of....
Let's get her <u>out</u> of here....
<u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
What is that that smells so wonderful.
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
Indeed we were.
...and my need for The Institution...
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
And how did he do that?
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
...you have to <u>eat</u>...
...but will that satisfy you?
Why should <u>you</u> care?
<u>Yes</u>.
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
You're <u>free</u>...
...which of us is free...?
No, that is code-word material, that's what <u>that</u> is....
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
Yeah, but who would marry friendless <u>me</u>...  Howabout you, Romeo...?
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
...what?
N'not <u>that</u> sad.
Every suicide kills two.
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
What would you guess, Ardelia?
You goin to shoot yourself? 
Don't shoot yourself.
Why?
...<u>what</u>...?
They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
...and that is what you need to expand.
Because it is exclusive... because <u>everyone</u> will be here...
Then we cannot go.
Because...?
Because we cannot <u>pay</u>...
....because we don't have any mmm...
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
Oh, my <u>program</u>...
Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
...get me a cigarette.
I know where he is.
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
I know where he is.
And why should we believe you?
I want the money.
What shape is the scar?
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling.
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
Or clear your windshield with it.
...what a lovely perfume.
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
Dottore Fanelli...
It would seem.
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
...I feel that...
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
Then what brings you back?
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
What does <u>that</u> mean?
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
...would you use a small word?
For approval.
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
...yes...?
Yes.
That's when you went to the Orphanage...
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
I can be a good pig. Babe. Charlotte's Web. Good pig. Watch.
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
Did you wait until you were 18?
I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
I'm not really a--Does it count if...
Wha-at?  What is it?
Everything.
Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.
Your Secret admirer?
That wants to be a Yes.
Why do you even like me?
Uh-huh.
The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.
Clever observation. Go back to Wichita.  Oh that's right, you can't.
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
That's not what I was worried about.
Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
Talia's a rock. She'll be fine...
I think your condescension is even better.
It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
Talking while kissing.
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
Do you really think I care?
Something more interesting than that...How could you?  How could--!
Thank you, my love.                                         ]
Betty Finn. Gosh.....
Don't get cocky, girl.
Shoot.
Nice guys finish last. I should know.
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
Hey, don't run away now.
Let's do it on the coats. It'll be excellent.
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
All right.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Oh yeah, that's it.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Oh yeah, that's it.
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
Uh-huh.
Don't think.
Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?
You goddamn bitch!
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
Did we? How the hell'd you get in here?
I made your favorite. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
Color me nauseous.
He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.
Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
Yeah, maybe.
Heather.
Jealous much?
Yeah, I just got back.
Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
Give it up girl!
Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
Uh-huh.
Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
Suicide is a private thing.
If everyone jumped off a bridge, young lady, would you?
Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University.
I don't really like your friends either.
Killing her won't solve anything.
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.
Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
You're not funny.
No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own.
That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
That's good. Have you done this before?
Next channel, darling.
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
You can't be serious? Hey listen, my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over.
French.
Did to.
Did not.
Did to.
Did not.
I was just making it more special.
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
You kids are making too much damn noise.
Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you.
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
This knife is filthy.
No-o!
I thought I...you..
Let's kick his ass.
Let's kick his ass.
Cool off, we're seniors.
Goddamn Geek!
I think so, man.
Any contestants worth mentioning?
Superb.
But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
I work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.

Come on through.

Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.

Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
What does old Stew want?
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
You have to let me go!

Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.

I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
Oh-what a nice outfit!
Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
I put on a lot of weight over Christmas.
Mummy!
Somebody's got to help us!
It doesn't matter.
Of course it matters! It's Mario!
Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
He . . .
This . . .
That . . .
It's so beautiful!
What???
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
What??
That idiot boarder?
Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
You mean travel by ourselves?
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
Just a couple more . . .
That was what we were led to believe . . .
Too right . . . but he doesn't have a show! Nobody gets into Mother's draws except Daddy!
I need my sodding parents' consent.
Yes . . .
Mummy!
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
Your wife...?
No wisdom, no insight, no plan.
I miss her. I miss my wife.
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
The way you just looked at me...
I know, my bedside manner's horrendous.
I'm stumped.
It's inside a moving car.
Second most common?
Skin cancer.
Eighty third most common.
Pitbull attacks.
You just made that up.
I did more then that.
Well?
Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
I have my connections
Really? Do tell.
Gwen.
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
I quit. Today's my last day.
Someone special.
Ambrose. I know.
I've been in here before.
Allison Dormere. Your intern.
I said she's been missing for-
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
Zero's a number right?
Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
What?
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
Eighty four.
But... I thought...
I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?
Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan 
I only married you for your body.
For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
Okay then. Here's the scoop.
No please make yourself at home.
Music to my ears.
Who the hell are you talking to?
Can you follow them?
Wow you are out of it.  
You should always listen to your subconscious. It's trying to tell you something about your waking life.
I surrender...
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-
What do you mean?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
You.
It's getting hot in here.
Well now there's a compliment.
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
I know a guy who only has one leg.
In private.  They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones.
The bathroom!  For two days?
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
Lighten up, John.  You think <u>you</u> got problems for Chrissake?
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
I got your bail continued.
Bail, for Chrissake!  I'm innocent!
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
How recently?
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
Were you in it?  In the war?
You never saw that picture, huh?
What picture?
Thanks.  Thanks, pal.
All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
Uh, actually... yes... I... should never have come forward and presented myself as --
No, I don't have the right.  You're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!
Goodnight, John.
Read it.  It'll be fine.
You do?
I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
This guy LaPlante won an award?
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
You're sitting on your ticket.
Apparently the guy who pulled you out wasn't a passenger...
A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?
A Silver Mike!  You're covering us in glory!
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
Said he's not an actor.
She can't quit.
What?
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
I... I saw him out the window.
Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
Dad!
Never reach out!
Hello, Mister Wallace.
You didn't... get it on with him?
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Reporters don't have hormones?
I didn't ask him.
They're really white.
Whoa, check it out.
Let's watch some TV.
Where are these toys of yours?
I'm looking for some perfume.
Any particular brand?
Well, it's for a woman.
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
-- institution.
Oh, good -- well, I hope you'll have more to tell me next time.
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
A sense of proportion.
I should.
Maybe I could take a look at it now.
Do you do washing machines, too?
Just show me the way.
Isn't that always the way?
So, you're just kind of a roving --
It's a living.
Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
About us.
I'm thirsty.
Aw, okay.
A man scared me.
A man?  Was it a dream?
Uh huh.
Did Daddy tease you?
I've asked him what's wrong.
And?
He'll never appreciate it more.
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
Here, take this out to the table.
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool.
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
Stop knowing me so well.
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
But it's what we want.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
It's a nice pool, isn't it?
And it's a shorter commute.
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
Good -- that's what I was trying to project.
What?
Honey, are you okay?
Huh?
Oh -- great.
<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
There's no card or anything.
All new houses have noises.
What next?!  -- A strange bra under my pillow!
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
Where should I hide the car keys?
Philip!  The senior partner?
His secretary just confirmed.
What?
There might be some extras in the garage.
Someone blew the whistle.  Someone hates me.
"Honey, I'm a zombie, I don't know whether I'm coming or going."
I'm having the floor fixed,
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
Look, I think we should work things out.
I think it's time I came home now.
That's not a decision for you to make on your own.
Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
How large is your brood?
Two -- three if you count the husband.
Shut up.
What for, dickweed?
It's fun.
Grow up, Dreyer.
Do you have enough money?
Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
What did the thermometer say?
The thermometer's broken.
Can we keep him?
Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
No.
Get on the other side of that.
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
Right over here.
It's a double.
Even better.
Even cosier.
Would you?
Uh huh.
Really.
Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
They appear to be authentic.
Yes.
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
We don't have any proof of that.
I don't need proof.  I know it.  Send it out.
I think it was England.
Why?
What?
Lieutenant.
Congratulations.
A few days ago.
I already told you.  I took a walk.
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
Central Park.
Where have you been for the last seven years?
And Brenda?
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
You sure?
Get outta here.
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
What?
Sing.
That's all?
Yes.
I see.  You don't care about life anymore.
Leaving what?
And what do you think you will find in another land?
Then it's worth the journey.
As friends -- always as friends.
If it came down to it what would you do?
How long is the voyage?
Living.  Remember?
She's the King's cousin.
Then she should be an excellent dancer.
What worries you?
You.
The only thing you can do.  You must end it.
It's done.
No -- I will.
I stood up first.
That doesn't matter.
You always get to go first.
No -- after you.
Can you really tell from doing that?
What do you think?
I think you just like to eat dirt.
She's a treasure she is.
She'll soon be of age.
Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
How?
I lied.
The past?
Sometimes.
Because it's the past -- and things that are in the past are best left there.
Why not?
I'm leaving in the morning.
You'll no see me again.
I cannot explain.
Do you love me, Conner?
Aye.
Then take me with you.
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
Why are you doing this?
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
What do you want?
To talk to you.
A lucky guess.
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
You got me.
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
Why?  What's going on?
I'll be fine.
Then who's Russell Nash?
I don't know anymore.
You remind me of someone I used to know.
Who was that man last night?
I don't know.
Then how did he know your name?
New York is dangerous place.
Have you ever heard of the Calan?
You look like you have.
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
Why?
You're twenty minutes late.
Sorry.
I know.
I've lived all over the world.
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
I wanted to get to know you better.
Yes -- it is.
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
Why don't you tell me.
Why not?
--for three hundred years.
I've seen it.
On the back it has--
And the other one -- he is like you?
It will end tonight.
Must you fight him?
He will not stop until it is over.
Get out.
Conner?
What's that next to him?
And this?
I was working on the cataloging.
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?
Perhaps -- but it comes off none the less.
That's what the Kurgan said.
The Kurgan was a pussy.
How can that be?
No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
Aye -- that I would, lass.
It's not for me to decide.
Yes.
What will you do?
You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.
And now it's time to come out of the shadows.
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
I think he's dead!
Don't shout, Larry.  I'm three feet away.
The mother is in Florida visiting her sister.  The father works at home, so he's probably inside.
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
Get to work.
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
I'll make the call.
I guess not.
Am I talkin' raghead?!  I want your car! <u>Gimme the goddamned keys</u>!
You're not goin' anywhere!  Get on the fuckin' floor!
You won't die if you let me help.
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
Because if you don't take the chance, you're already dead.
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
What if he's dead?  What if you killed him?
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --
Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need anti-depressants.
That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
Not if they're looking at something else.
I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
Kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
I'm not going to die for this!
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
How about the cop?
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
I got these people!  You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
I'm here.
That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
Let me come get him.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
My father.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
I'm getting a doctor!
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
You can't run with suitcases.
I got the gasoline --
We don't have time!
They'll cut the power.
Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --
I don't eat junk food.
You fucked up, Glen.
An hour, tops.  Might be sooner.
What do you mean?
Canyon Country.
I think you got no choice.
You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
Close.
We'll see you in a couple of hours.
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
But they're not here yet.  Tell me about <u>you</u>.
I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
That's okay.  I love you anyway.
Be quiet!  Listen!
That big asshole nailed my windows.
Mine, too.
Shh, they'll hear you!
I don't drink beer.
We can't make the microwave work.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.
Mars?  What are you doing?
Whatever.
He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
He said something about a girl --
What are we going to do about Mike?
Keep your head down.
Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.
What are you doing?!  Stop that!
He.  Can't.  Answer.
I need to talk to him.  Alone.
Another minute.  Please --
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
Go, Chief.
Go, Chief.
Tell her I'm almost home.
Go.
You have her cell number?
She didn't answer.
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator --
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
Then I think we should wait.  Do you agree?
I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
Goddamned small town bullshit.
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
Go, Mickey.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
Go, Mickey.
Don't be funny, Chief.  You can't afford it.
What?
Not until the man calls.
Where's the office?
Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
We're okay.
Where are you right now?
In my room.
What do you want me to do?
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
Look for names.  Does it say whose taxes they are?
Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
Charles G. Benza.  They're coming!
No!  They're right here --
They're still in the house.
Yes.
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
Smith will know.
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
You don't want another dead child on your conscience.
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
I'm sorry, it's a private function.
A delegation.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
Let me see your identity card.
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
No. I work at the Mille Collines.
Let me explain.
There is nothing to it.
Name a price.
Ten thousand francs for each one.
Six.
And four children?
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Yes we have.
What was the response?
We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
Canadian Club?
Excuse me, Colonel.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
I can't, I don't have the men.
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
Watch everything? How? They are gone.
And what will they do with these satellites?
Well rewarded Those were his words.
You said you had no whiskey.
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
Bring back your policemen...
Get in.
Your police are at the gate?
After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
Listen, you need me.
How so.
When the Europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists.
You think they will believe you?
You will tell them the truth.
I will do nothing unless you help me now.
Business is good at the hotel?
Very good.
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
You have no whiskey?
Why not? We are half way there already.
We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.
What is it?
Oh my God!
Fuck you.
Just give me a moment to get your keys.
Good. I'd like to book a massage.
Very soon.
Thank God.
Give me the phone.
Gregoire, what are you doing here?
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
The fog is too heavy, sir.
Just drive, Gregoire.
I saw the sign.
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
Promoted. House Manager.
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
This goes out live?
I know that, Paul. I'm sorry.
Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
Why sir?
Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
I will remember that name.  Let's go.
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
The commander is not here.
He will be here.
Show me your ID
What?
Our cards, please.
What cards?
You have our cards.
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
Of course.
The third floor are low class rooms.
Also, this is your bill for the last week.
Yes, with Fedens and the children.
He wants your wisdom.
Let's have dinner first.
Of course.
What?
We must do something.
You could have asked for a favor.
Murdered! By whom?
I sent them home. Go and call them.
I tried already. The phones do not work.
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
Dawn. Then they go.
Where are you hurt, son?
Stay with the children.
Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them.
It will do just fine.
No, Odette says he's in shock.
How can we help him.
No. They are not dead. Stop this.
What are you saying, Tatsi?
What for Paul.
So where is the lamb?
Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
Tell me what it was.
A car.
I want to know.
A Volkswagen!
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
Please, please try one more time.
No.
No! Sit down now.
I will follow on the next plane. Go.
Paul! Then another voice.
We are almost out of everything.
What sort of plan?
What's wrong?
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
What's wrong?
You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
Many times.
Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi.
How dead?
He has taken the presidential suite.
What! Paul storms off.
The lieutenant wants the register.
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
Many beers.
As the trucks go.
It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
The staff, the guests.
The staff and guests! How many?
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
No, I don't want you going on the street.
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
Who is this Simon?
Where?
On the street.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
What is his room number?
I don't know.
Go downstairs, I will help you.
If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
It's complicated. But don't worry --
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
Not at all!
Oh dear.
More to the point. Where's our host?
Ms. Marr!
Is she alright?
Excuse me?
I don't know!!
As a tumor.
If this is someone's idea of a joke --
Yeah, me too.
And I think that's case --
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
You sure? You'll be alright by yourself?
You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
-- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then.
Nothing.
Left, goddamnit!
Yes.
The...Fourth of July.
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
Poor Mr. Price --
What?
It's not going to let us out!
Me? You've gotta be kidding.
Up here --
Over here!
Take the gun.
Prove it how?
I thought she was dead. For sure.
Don't push it.
You need to get out more.
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
Why not?
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
-- that's the fact, bud --
-- where the hell were you?
-- listen to the man --
Let's try down here...
That's crazy!
What about that other guy?
It'll have to do.
He's dead...?
We're safe?
-- was that??
For chrissake give me a hand!
Run.
What --
Jesus!
So where's the party?
Oh, I think we're going to have several.
You're hurting me.
I know.
Really? Well, let it rip.
-- in the act.
Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.
Stalking the wild poltergeist.
-- and who's next on your list?
-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
-- thank you! All the cards finally on the goddamn table!
Question answered.
-- what...are...you...going...to --
Steven??
Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
You didn't think to ask?
I was in the middle of --
-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
No, no, it's just --
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
And here's your goddamn severance!
My wife. Where were we?
Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.
I think it's something better experienced then described.
Maybe if I --
Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
I am.
I'll try not to remember to warn Evelyn.
Something with the power, I don't know!!
I think I'll do what I damn well please.
I never saw you --
Well, I can't, sweetheart.
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Please! I need your help.
Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
Rewind that.
No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
He must've beaten us all here!
I can't comment until I get paid.
What's going on?
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
Hasn't been a telephone in this House in over 60 years.
Why not?
Excuse me?
Oh, dear.
He must've unsealed the room!
How, he's supposed to be dead!
-- ten.
Over here.
Melissa...?
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
Keep talking, I'll find you!
Something....happened --
-- I'm coming --
-- something horrible...I don't understand --
You say you saw some activity here?
What's the matter?
Colleen.
We don't have proof of that.
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
Why don't you pass me your plate?
No!
A few years older, perhaps.
How's your arm?
I'm sorry.
There's no need to be.
Good-bye.
I don't understand.
Well I bet you they're happy.
I didn't do anything, mommy.
Well then who did?!
Maybe it was Colleen...
Who...is Colleen?
She talks to me.
I'm scared!
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
We're going to go someplace new.
What about all my other stuff?
We'll get it later.
What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
Where is she?
She's here.
Where is she now?
She's hiding.
Take me to her.
Sure.  Did you see the others?
I want this one, daddy.
He's blessing the house.
Why?
That's great, honey.
Don't be afraid!
Daddy, please!!!
Daddy help!
Well, that all depends.
Good night daddy.
What will Aubrey think?
Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
Whatever you say.
To our family.
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
I don't know.  That's strange.
Yeah, well I'll be joining you shortly.  I just want to...
Ok.
It was in the cellar.  Weird.
So what are you saying?
I don't know what I'm saying.
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
Well what do you think it is?
Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
What about keeping an open mind?
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
Are you ok?
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
A friend?
I think everything's ready.
Good.  I'll start bringing things in.
She's gone!
Aubrey?!  Aubrey?!
Aubrey!
Ok...
Know what?
I'm ok.
I'm all right...
She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
Maura.
You'll have to settle for turkey.
White meat will be fine...
Yes, I am.
May I come in?
Did you know her very well?
What!
Come back to us honey!
And you...are?
Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
Perhaps I'll see you in church.
The amulet...
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
It will not take long...
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
Not someone.  Something. I've never felt a presence that strong before.
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
Not at all, if it can help.
What?
There's something through that wall!
Well what is it!
I know what I saw.
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
Your apartment.
What happened to him?
It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
No.  No.  It's fine.  Come now.  I was having bad dreams anyway.
Why are you so interested?
Sorry.
What?
I'm trying to quit.
It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
Every day.
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
Sure.  Why?
It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
What on earth were you doing down here?
Buying some drugs, alright?
Oh, Terri ...
God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
You gonna buy?
I don't know.  Maybe.
You're JP Monroe, right?
Uh-huh.
A prize?  For what?
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
Don't do that!  Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it...
Wow.  Thank you.
No.  Thank you.
Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
But how in God's name ...
It has already begun.
Not quite.
JP?
Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
Yeah really.  I'm ...
C'mon.  It'll be great.
Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
I laughed, I cried.
Guards come exactly every three minutes....
My next word was gonna be "consciousness."  Swear to God... tubby.
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.
Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it.
There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
You're not...LISTENING!
Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
"He kicks up at anything he hears.
"Every day you meet quite a few."
Geez, Gates was killed.  Who do we send the thank you note to?
But I said I was sorry....
Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin thing is in Moscow, isn't it?
Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
Why not just go now?
Okay.
"Maybe we're ragged and funny."
Don't worry, we'll get it...
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
You can be lookout!.....  Take Alex's gun.
"But we'll be the same as we started...
You're a reed, man.  I gotta get Anna.  Hang in there...
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Get em....
Too-do-loo, babe.
Yes way.
It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
Last rites, sister?
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
You're supposed to be dead!
Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...
I never break a date.  Scout's honor.
I was the Warden?
How long were you in?
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
Uh....old badminton injury.
Oh, I'm so sorry...
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
Trust Leonardo....
Wha.....
Actually he never told us what it was.
Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.
I don't care.
So let's get busy.  Have some fun and make some deals.
But you're going to tell us anyway...
The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
Remember that shoe you lost...
Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.
For God's sake, chain this convict.
Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
Bastard!  If you were a true American.
Just shut up and hit me!
Employer?  The president?
I'm supposed to fall for that?
Shucks.  Guess not.
Tell me about it...
The Dancing Dingus!
The Jerky Circle!
Sharp.
Snappy.
The Shazzammeter!
The Hipster!
The Circle-o'-Gaiety!
The Hudswinger!
The Hoop-dee-doo!
The Hudsucker Hoop!
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
Lumbago.
A sawbuck!
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
On Norville Barnes!
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
Why yes, do you know it?
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
...Why don't I just type this up...
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
...You do?
You know, on farm route 17.
Oh yes! In Muncie!
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
Consider this my resignation --
Norville!
Huh?!
As a three-dollar bill.
Sez who?
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
It's about a dimwitted editor who --
He grins wolfishly.
Terrific.
Ya know, entry level!
Tell me about it.
I got big ideas, though!
I'm sure you do.
Nooo, I don't guess you will be.
Forty-eight years...
I thought you served misfits here!
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
What the heck they doin'?
This I know, Benny.
This you're familia' with.
...Geez.
It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too --
Huh?! But, buddy --
An example must be made!
Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Nah, that's all forgotten.
...It is?
But, Buzz, you know I never --
And Sid says you stole it!
But Buzz --
Yes sir...
Yeah?
Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now!
I --
Well, I'm a college graduate --
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
Well, I made the dean's list.
No, sir.
Not even behind your back?
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
But, sir! --
Get your feet off that desk.
Oh my God, sir!
But, sir!
Sir, my leg is on fire!
Oh my God, sir!
Yeah, tell me about it.
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
Ya get the special?
Fah from it...
There's one in every story.
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
She's looking for her mark.
She looks in her purse...
The mark notices.
Maybe he's wise.
He don't look wise.
Plan two: Here come the waterworks.
Old Faithful.
Hello, Niagara.
He notices.
...Her mother needs an operation...
...adenoids.
No, Bennie: Lumbago.
He don't look wise.
She is!
She's damn good, Lou.
Thank you for waking me.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
At the Houmfort.
That's nonsense, Alma.
If you say, miss.  If you say.
I'm afraid so.
Ti-Joseph?
Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
I've never heard of a cure.
Is this disease common in the tropics?
I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
Yes.
Where were you trained?
That's rather nice, isn't it?
My brother's wife.
I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.
It's my day off.
I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
Did you hear what he sang?
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
But she's not dead, Wes.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
Of course not!
I'm sorry...
Many people thought her beautiful.
And charming?
I've never given it much thought.
Good morning.
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
I often do.
Help me? How?
I hated her.
I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
Yes.
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
Betsy, tell them about the Houmfort.  Tell them what you saw there.
Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
Up the organization!  Bastard.
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
In Rhode Island with the folks. I'm a free agent tonight.
No thank you. We should be off.
I wasn't star--
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
Good night.
You want to go?
What do you think?
Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
So early?
Rough day. Good night.
I... I think I am...
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
Stuffed and baking.
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
That one.
See for yourself.
No advice from the experts, huh?
You think I --
I have no idea.
What's on your mind? Don't --
Don't be dim.
Elena, what are you're talking about?
I'm not surprised.
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
If you're going to insult me --
In the car.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
That this was going to be a key party?
I'm not.
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
We're not going anywhere.
Ben.
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Yeah. Well, we can just --
All right.
Classes?
Good.
Grades?
Fine.
Anyone special? You know...
Hnnn.
Thanks.
Stay out of trouble.
Libbets? What kind of name is Libbets?
Yeah?
Birth control.
Right. Gotcha.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
What are you talking about?
What?
Good night kiddo.
What you been up to?
What do you think we're doing, dad?
Yeah.
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
That's besides the point.
But what?
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
Darn it, Dave.
It was lovely!
And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
Yeah. You?
Phone's out. I hope the pipe's --
Who?
Nobody.
Mikey Williams?
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
It'll warm you up.
It's not a bother.
I insist.  Don't touch them.
It's really quite all right.
Of course.
It's not like we're too busy.
How'd you know?
Educated guess.
None at all. I'll leave it in front of your garage. Happy Thanksgiving.
No need to make excuses --
Forget what?
Forget how to ride a bike.
All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
That's right.
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
Now you are being rude.
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
I'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile.
Do what?
What do you mean?
Am I right or am I right?
Shit. You're not planning --
Moisture! Moisture!
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
One for you and one for me.
Major.
Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
You going to tell dad?
Would it matter?  And what's that?
Play with the whip.
The Idiot.
Hey, it's a sellable skill.
What is it?
Thanks for the advice dad.
Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
Who said so?
I don't have a girlfriend.
Yeah?
Geometry?
Sure, anything but this English.
I'm not good at math. Just geometry.
It's freezing.
Sure.  Twinkie?
I'm chewing.
Tell Sandy? What?
Then why'd you come after me?
I dunno. I --
I don't know.
You like him? He worships you.
Wendy!
Huh?
4:30 movie. When Worlds Collide.
Yeah. Yours?
You get in trouble?
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Charles, what time is it?
Is this Charles?
What time is it?
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
Hey Sandy.
Mikey was looking for you.
Yeah? See ya.
The ones you built?
What are you doing?
Just thought I'd stop by.
Are you his girlfriend?
No.
He wouldn't blow up. He'd just get all mangled or twisted.
Vodka?
You never tasted the stuff?
One more shot?
Okay.
That's nice. Are you drunk?
I don't know. How do I know?
I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down.
That's all, for now.
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
What's that, then?
Four unwarranted shootings, witness intimidation, and cocaine theft.
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
I had him!
It's only gonna make you crazy.
Too bad...
Actually...
Don't worry about him...
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
Do it again.
But there wasn't any...
Yeah.  All over.
Twelve years younger.
Five feet?  Seven feet?
Worth pursuing?
Byrd's dead.
Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
Where is he?
Anything.  It's important.
We'll get the other one, though.
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
Around twelve-thirty.
Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.
Has her books in it.
I told her to come.
What?
That's right.
What happened at that signing?
That boyfriend.  Randy.
Seven years.
You know what about.
That's right.
One word to I.A. and he walks.
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
What are we thinking?
I'm always all business.
That's not what he thinks.
What did he look like?
What is it?
Huh?
You heard me that time.
But she was seeing someone else on the side.
Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
What kind of stuff?
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
The other guy?
I told you I don't remember.
After that she left the party to go to him.
Ran like hell to go to him...
Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your fucking cop questions...
You don't know.
She didn't tell me.
Good to see you, too, Randy.
You're not missing much.
Best friend?
Since grade school.
That's a long time.
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
Long as it's fun.
Thought you wanted something fun...
That's what I said.
She wouldn't tell me!
But you were such good <i>friends...</i>
My arm!
What was it?
Brody...I don't know...  ...Something Brody!
The phone call.  The knapsack.
But she was an attractive girl.
I suppose.
Did you have sex with her?
But you wanted to.
I was a mentor to her.
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
Yes.
I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
He.  Well, he...
Told you I could write an ending.
There's nothing more to talk about.
But we work so well together...
Then so was mine...
Don't you pull that shit with me.
I didn't want to kill her, Will.
If you want it to be...
No back-up.
You're not following procedure.
Drop the gun, Walter.
Yes, and very beautiful.
Your lips, they didn't move.
If there were a leader, I would be the one.
Ah! You have questions?
What are we?
Nothing if not vampires...
Surely you know the one who made you...
You mean we are not children of Satan?
Perhaps...
Then God does not exist...
I have not spoken to him...
You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
Knew? You mean he is...
Listen to me.
No, my beloved, my child.
If you say so. You are innocent.
How he must have loved you.
Follow me - that way - through my cell -
I can't save her.
I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
You were their leader. They trusted you.
We are a pair, and that's what counts.
What night? What do you mean?
Is this my birthday?
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
And if I cut my hair again?
It will grow back again!
DID YOU DO IT TO ME????
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess.
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
No. Laudanum.
Louis, put me in my coffin...
I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
What have you done?
The way I learn everything. By watching you.
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
Why does he call you that?
Sit still. It's not finished -
Why not?
Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
The swamp...
I can't. Go away from me.
It is! Take the back stairwell -
Not yet.
Still my beautiful child.
Claudia, you torture yourself.
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
And no one knows but us...
Yes, and very beautiful.
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
You really believe that?
It's only mortal death.
Then my luck would have changed.
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
Why should I be?
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
Call him.
I can't do it.
You've just done it -
But why do you want me?
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
You asked for death. I didn't promise it -
Yes...
Sure...
I want a woman.
The crucifix -
Forget the crucifix. Take him.
You have fed. You were made for this...
You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
Read her thoughts.
I can't.
As did the one who made me.
Respect me a little then. I'm the only life you know.
I know. Let her alone.
THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!!
What are you saying?
You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine...
I didn't want to kill her.
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me ---
Are you mad????
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me?
It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
So shall we begin?  What do yo do?
Perhaps lucky for both of us.
Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
You can't look at them...
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
Can a vampire feel love?
You loved your wife, surely.
How could I not? She had to know.
And did you lose her? Did she go?
But it has. There is no more to tell.
My daughter...
Checking in...Karla Wilson.
Is that bad?
Sorry. Emergencies only.
What the hell would you call this?
Who? Who is here?
Phones went down a few minutes ago.
Stupid. What were you thinkng?
The guy looks dead.
Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
What are you doing in my closet?
No.
No means yes.
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
But, he said he'd try.
No, I'm the King of the World.
Where is everyone? I'll ask --
I also promised Tyrell.
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
I miss Ray...I tried to call him.
Don't even think about it.
Okay, I won't.
Yes.
Yes.
Not me...no way...
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
Just kidding.
Come on, Julie. You saw his room.
What do we do?
Come on, you can make it.
No, you're not.
...Nancy?
Is he?
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Ray, we're just friend.
Can't what?
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
It's gonna be great.
You know me to well.
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
Ben Willis.
I told you.
Wait, it's Nancy --
I'm fine.
You sure?
I'm fine.
You don't seem fine.
Right. Now I remember.
Are you sure?
What?
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
You can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand.
What do you mean, Julie?
He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
It's in my room!
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
Did you get help?
He's in it with Willis?
I guess so.
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
Rio, baby!
I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
I don't know, but I'm starving.
I said we start having fun. And that means now.
Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
How's Julie?
He's probably the only one who can help us.
Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
No. Yes?
How much?
How much?
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
Not anymore.
He leave you?
No. I shot him.
You stumbled into my hiding place.
Must have missed the sign.
Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
So why are you still here?
Crowded.
And do what with it?
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
What is up with that weirdo?
I'll go find him.
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
My friend -- what can one say --
I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
Maybe you're right. Help me get something to carry her downstairs.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
Sleep well.
I think not.
On my word! That's what they believe.
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
Closer and closer - until they bite into your throat!
I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.
Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
How old is she?
I was looking for you.
No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
They shall not hurt you
Thea is an orphan.
What is it -- what are you talking about?
You have forgotten my last name?
My last name is Pherides.
The General  you don't even know him.
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
Didn't you? But now -- what are you thinking now?
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
Wouldn't I?
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
I don't care who he is. He doesn't know.	He can't tell 
Theodosia.
Her family name?
She's not too well.
What is her illness?
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
Why -- no not before Thea came 
I'll only go as far as the shore and wait for you.
Oh, now  now look here 
I can't understand that.
The rider on the pale horse is Pestilence. He follows the wars.
But the war, the army  they need you.
We still don't know that it's the plague 
Dr. Drossos will tell us. We will know what to do then.
If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
I had a notion you had become selfappointed chaperone lately  why?
Listen to what I say --
When you make sense I'll listen.
I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
Everything's so simple. I like you.
You see? Thea believes it, too!
The General threatened me.
I can't.
Why in the world can't you?
He hates all my race.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
All I'm asking is thirty days more . . .
How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
All right  all right.
I'm hurrying.
Carter  bank examiner.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Suicide.
Well, who are you, then?
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
Angel, Second Class.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
Made what?
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
You're nobody. You have no identity.
Zuzu's petals.
Where's Mary?
Oh, well, I can't . . .
Well, keep your eyes open. See the town?
That's your problem, George Bailey.
A boy?
George Bailey.
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
They went out of business years ago.
I know. I know.
I know that girl!
Hiya, George!
Hi, Bert.
Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
All right.
Of course it's the place.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
Yes, but he's got the faith of a child  simple. Joseph, send for Clarence.
Mother? What do you want?
When'd you see him last?
Today, over at the house.
Well, what happened to you?
I won a flower.
Want to give my flower a drink.
Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
Give the flower a drink.
Uh-huh.
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
Hee-haw!
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
A cattle boat?
The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick?
I'm all right.
Please don't go away  please!
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Came back three days ago.
Nice girl, Mary.
Oh, stop that grunting.
Hmmm . . .
Hmmm?
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
Well, she's not crazy about him.
Yes, sir.
Yes  charge.
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
Aw, get going!
Yes, sir.
Don't hurt my ear again!
Oh, it's wonderful.
Hope you enjoy it.
Where's my insurance policy?  Oh, here . . .
No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
Okay.  What's yours?
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
Well, no younger than I was.
Maybe you were born older, George.
How's that?
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
Very funny. Very funny.
Come on, George, let's hurry.
Did you get a doctor?
Say, where's Mother?
Harry . . . Harry . . .
Do me a favor, will you, George?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
She was here first.
Hello, Violet.
Hello, Vi.
Nothing.
I know, but . . .
Yeah  yeah . . . sure I will.
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
Some other time, George.
It's important.
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
How do you do.
Hello?
Yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now.
We'll save them for seed. A toast!
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
They're not my children.
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
Have you notified the police?
I'll take chocolate.
I don't like coconuts.
Neither am I.
Okay  what can we lose?
You may kiss my hand.
Ummmmm . . .
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
Uh-huh.
Come on, tell me.
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
Have you made up your mind?
About what?
Where'd you get that dress?
Do you like it?
No, I don't want to be rude.
Well, then, sit down.
Don't you like her?
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
No, marriage is all right for Harry, and Marty, and Sam and you.
That does it  come here.
Please, let's not stop, George.
I'll be back in a minute, Mary.
Thanks for dropping around.
Hi.
You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
Yeah, just started.
Left them at the office.
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
The doctor? Was the doctor here?
Just a teensie one  ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
Going up to see Zuzu.
George, darling! Where have you been?
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
You have no idea what happened . . .
Huh?
You forgot something.
What?
Sure, sure I am.
Hmm? Well, I . . .
With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
What?
You going to the lighthouse?
Well, I don't know....
What the hell.  For you....
With butter, if they got any....
So's mine.
Soon, dark eyes, soon.
But of course.
I'm supposed to.
Someone pop your balloon?
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
I can't help it  it sticks in my mind.
Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
Stop paddling!
Swim for it!
Is she responsible for the punch?
Good.  It's terrible.
I hope that's the cousin.
They're moving pretty fast.
Yee-hah!
We better go back in.
It's not going to be easy.
I was counting on hours.
Mostly old garbage.  Today we found a '48 Hudson.
Lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.
Too hot in the lighthouse?
Oh, out a ways.  Maybe the lighthouse.
The Shark.
We'll take your supercargo.
You're betting what you already got.
Sean!  Catch it!
What the hell, we're steering for it.
Let's just go sailing, okay?
Want to talk about it?
Want to swim home?
You bet.  Hang on....
Anyone got another set of sails?
Over here!
The rope!  The rope!
Can you get us a line?
Oh, yeah.  Sure.
What is it?  What's there?
I need a hand here....
Aren't you off-duty?
Happy to do it.
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
In here.
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
You got it.
Not the drugstore!
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
You can't stop me.
Please.  It's my job.
No place special.  Just hanging out.
What else is there to do?
I'll be careful.  I'll see y'later.
Oh, c'mon.
You heard me.
Not till next year.
Yeah?
I kind of had plans....
Pop.  I'm sorry.
It's okay.  What happened?
At least you're safe.  What about the others?
What?
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
Okay, okay -- stand over there....
Sorry, I'm all booked up...  Come, m'dear.
Too late, it's written.
You're damn right that's what it is.
First things first.
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
The Shark's mouth.
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
That's it.
Okay, so that's it.
Is there one in these waters?
What makes you think there might be?
Sound?
Late.
My boss and your boss.  Sure.
Because they're playing our song.
And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
I did, I did.
Fooling around?
Home it is.
MMMmmmorning....
Door's locked.
Good.
Mrs. Silvera.
As far as the office.
Better yet.
So's a donut.
What're you guys doing today?
In the den.
For me?
Careful.  What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing, huh?
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
Oh.  Want to talk about it?
Terrific.
Sean's asleep.
That's great too.  Gorgeous.
What'd I say?
Going out.
Mike's out there.
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
Perfect.  Look at this ---
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
Brody?  This is Patrol Base.
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
Yeah?  Then what?
When?
Shouldn't he be at home?
No.  Find your brother, okay?
What's daddy doing?
You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?
Hiya yourself.
Dad!  Dad!
That's you.
I've never been supercargo.
Now I really want to see it.
Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
Shh.  Shhh....
It's all right, we're okay.
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
I'm not crazy about blind dates.
I want you to meet my cousin.
I will, I will.
Maybe.
Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
Help!  Help!
Okay, okay, coming....
Nope.
Me neither.
Who'd you ask?
Tina Wilcox.
You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
I know.
What's that mean?
Nope.
Give me back my hat!
Double nope!
What about sailing?
It'll take us to Budapest if you're not careful.
What're we going to do in the mean time?
I dunno.  We'll think of something.
And second?
Mmmmmm.
Anything.  Anything.
What Kids?  Who went out?
Anything?
Until we find something.
What the hell is it?
Power line.
Oh, great.
Now you're talking.  Let's get out of here before we do find something.
Is there something I don't know about?
I'll be right there.  Wait up.
It'll be fun, come on!
No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
I love it.
Coming about....
Might as well.
When are we going out?  You and me?
You going with Patrick?
Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
Coming about, then.
How was dive class?
Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
Yeah.
You're going sailing.
Maybe.
Take me.
No.
Quiet!  Shhh!
Michael....
Okay, okay.  Close your door.
I'm not in the way.  Andy, am I in the way?
Would you take him?
Oh, shit.
Maybe nobody will notice.  Let's get them back in the bus.
What the hell is he doing?
Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over.  We have to deal with the consequences.
Forget it, he won't listen.
No, I'm fine, thanks.
With those camera lights and...
Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
You buying?
Sure am.
Coming with us?  Overman's buying.
Yeah.  Down there.
No.
She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
Never know down there.  Helps to have a friend, sometimes.
How many sharks have you killed?
What is it, 97 days?
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Hope I make it through both.
You will.  I'll see to it.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
Pre-opening jitters.
I guess.
Don't forget you have your brother.
See you later.
Honey, I gotta go.
Okay, bye.
And what else is bothering you?
Yeah, you really don't like him.
I don't like what he does.
It's his work.
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
Get out of here!
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
I don't have a choice.
Take a deep breath and hold it.
That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.
Just put your mask on.
No.
Are you scared?
Yes.
Hi, baby.
They just wanted to say hello.
... Friggin' fish.
That's a lot of ground to cover.
Oh, yeah.  Very.
Let's not talk about that now, okay?
Up.
And leave me down here???
Make up your mind.
Yes.
After what happened to us?
I know I can capture it.
Kathryn, you're crazy.  Really crazy.  A suicidal maniac.
What's that?
Bracelets.
Yes?
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Why?  'Cause they're hungrier?
No.
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
How's your patient?
Recovering nicely.
Me, too.
You don't.
What's up?
... Mean through the tubes?
Yes.  It's faster.
No,  I'm not going through there.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
... He ought to put him in here.
It's too soon to move him.
So tell Calvin.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
Well, that's why you got it.
Hydrophobia...
I have to get out of here.
I can't take water, Kathryn.
Yes, you can.
So?
What do you mean, we don't?
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
You wanted to know about a cave?
It's all controlled from the Control Room.
Who's going to do it?
I am.  You're not.
But you --
I want that shark, Kathryn.
Only to myself.
I'm  fine.
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
Fine.  Have them do some.
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
Make this quick!
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
I can have them walk backwards.
No, no.  That won't do.
I told you, something's upset them.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
What in hell is that?
Let's hope he knows that.
Afraid I can't do that.
Should be coming out of it soon.
Just watch it when he does.
Not at all.
Why are you?
I like it when they wake up.
So do I.  But for different reasons.
And I like you.
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
Some miss all their shots.
And here I thought I was charming you.
Get ready to go.
Thanks to you.
How'd it get in here?!
The water ski show!  We have to get them out!
They still seem nervous.
I know.
And big for his age.
Ten minutes ago.
I should have never listened to Calvin.
'Preciate it.
He's missing.
Thanks.
Someone's looking for you.
How you doing, Kelly?
Better than catching Sean's herpes.
Yeah, from Boston.
'Course they're also so rich.
... Massachussettans aren't.
How long you staying?
I don't know, it depends.
You like Florida?
Well, wait till you see the rest.
I'm a water-skier.
Are you really?
Sure am.
Come on!  Check this out!
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
Why you sonuvabitch...
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
The one that goes underwater?
Yes, it's great!
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
No, think of something else.
I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?
Can hardly wait to do it again.
Now what's this do?
Goes up.
What, hon?
Take it up.
He's diving!
SEAN!
Hold still, damn it!
What're you doing later?
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
I am serious.
Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
Now what?
Don't you dare.
Can't help it... ahh...
What?
Yes, there is goes.
It's disappeared.
Calvin said it was all right.
Yeah, well I didn't!
Aww, can't I keep it?
What the hell's there?
Polar bears.
Polar bears in Georgia???
South Georgia, Antarctica.
Oh...
The world's southern most reaches.
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
Reach for the limit I always say.
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
Five hundred yards.
You have a man near it?
You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
No way.
It's not closing, Mike.
That's impossible.
Okay, okay... We'll get someone on it.
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
Look great, don't I?
Got a job for me?
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
So was Dad.
He needs a haircut.
Yeah, right.
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
Gee, it's good to see you!
I want to see Kathryn.
Something wrong?
We're in love.
Sure.
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
That bugger moves fast.
She is a lovely bit of crumpet at that.
Absolutely.  The audience will stain their drawers.  I did.
But you always let me....
Not today.  Come on, Thea....
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
I don't want to.  I want to swing....
Was Uncle Sean ever bad?  Did you ever spank him?
My tea set.  I got my tea set.  Thank you....
Yes, you can make sandwiches....
It's time for tea, Grandma.
Chicken....
It sure is....
We need milk....
I'll be right there.
Tell Matt he should be here....
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
Because....
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
I don't know...You...I don't know.
Then don't come any closer.
Turn it off....
No....
Off....
I have work....
They're at the beach....
What's wrong?  What happened?
Thea was attacked by a shark....
But it went away...We would have known....
It went away....
I don't know....
I like it.  Really....
You're not interfering, Ellen....
I'd be afraid of losing....
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
Whatever happens next.....
You make sure they come?
You have something to say about everything....
What difference does it make?  It's here....
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
We're going down.  All of us....
We'll divert it...We'll do something....
He knows what he has to do....
Stop what?
I'm not doing anything.
Can't help myself....
I'm hungry, Mom....
Adds flavor....
You check it....
I'm on the phone....
Good.
What's going on?
I'd like that.  I need to be away from here.
It's too dangerous....
Thank you....
Mommy lets me....
Who's coming?
The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
I'll miss you....
You guys must be starving....
You're damn right I'm serious....
I'm just getting started....
I don't want you in the water anymore....
Dad died from a heart attack....
Come on, I'll show you around.
Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....
Okay.
Mom, please don't start that again....
You could teach...You could....
I'm not going to quit now....
I am.
He's not chasing and I'm not running. And that's ridiculous....
You're not a pain in the ass....
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
Trying to write our report....
I have to get this finished.
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
There's nothing to worry about....
I'm your mother.  It's my job....
No.
Why'd you come out here?
Why'd you take the boat?
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
Promise me....
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
I always listen to my feelings....
It could have been an accident....
It was no accident....
Sure you can....
I don't know how....
No one does till they learn....
Where do I pull off...?
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
It's wonderful....
Nothing....
No, you're not....
I'm terrific... Come on....
A big one....
A big one....
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
Good.  I have two left....
I have my own little island.
I like to travel....
Won't you get in trouble...?
There are...I'm tired of one-way conversations....
There's nothing to be sorry about.
The whole idea is preposterous....
My vision is perfect....
Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....
Yes you can....
I have coffee in the thermos.
I'm too young for coffee.  Can I drive the plane?
The wind does that.  Ever been to the Bahamas before?
I'm the artist.  Like my mother.
Just like that?
We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
She said it was coming....
Hell, no.  What kind of pilot do you think I am...?
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
Will you get the bloody hell out of here....
Aye, aye, Captain....
I fly elephants for smugglers....
It needs more time to charge.
Tell Thea I'm sorry....
You don't have to say anything, Matt ...I know how you feel....
Still chasing fish?
Still tagging conch?
We'll be done pretty soon....
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
How's Ellen?
I wish there was something I could do....
She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....
Stop busting my hump....
Try the area around the wreck....
Will you leave me alone...?
You tagging them...?
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
I made them, man....
I stuck them on, man....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
They won't fight with me....
Put me down, damnit....
Where the hell's the beer...?
I didn't do it on purpose....
Money is money....
They put bombs on dolphins....
You're afraid of the competition out there....
You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
Stop busting my hump....
I've struck the mother-lode.  I'm counting... spade work....
Spade's a garden tool....
Down here....
Gave them the day off....
As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
When we got the grant....
When I got the grant.....
When I signed on....
When I invited you...
We got it together, Jake....
Okay...we got it together....
You don't know shit about anything. Time you learned....
Lots of times....
So far..
What she's got.  Nine knots....
Shit....
What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
As long as he's been here....
Hoagie.
What do you know about him?
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
I am...You must know something about him....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
Maybe the gear crapped out....
Maybe it's gone....
Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
What about Carla's gig?
I'm going down, Jake....
She's not going to like it....
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Funny, Jake...Funny.
Just trying to be helpful....
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
'Snuck up on me....'
I don't like the song.
Screw you, Jake....
Mom....
I've got to get to her....
You jump, you'll kill yourself....
It'll work....
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
My equipment doesn't crap out....
No way....
It's my fault...I have to....
Who grows more beautiful....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
More beautiful with each passing minute...
I told you....
Happy birthday, darling. ...
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
I'm training to....
Anything to do before I go home?
Deputy Brody will take care of it personally.
Yes.
The van?
Is it your vehicle?
How about any guys on your staff?
I hope I'm not intruding?
I think you're here all day.
O.K.
What does that mean?
Not too good in daylight ..
Because, don't get into it ...
There's nothing in the files?
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
Maybe?
Someone bet me a dollar ..
Because I dislike her too much ..
So am I. But where's my money?
Then give me that Zippo.
Why?
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
To throw out of the window.
I was wrong.
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
You looked like you did?
Car accident.
You don't really believe this?
No .. You didn't know that ..
I'm asking it.
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
I'm going up to the institute.
Hey ..
I guess by the bed.
It's twenty of three.
What d'you mean, "bits."
We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
You ain't going in alone?
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
Yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body?
Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
I'm talking, outside the girl?
Once.
No.
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
I am calm .. <u>I am calm</u> ..
No .. But we have a theory ..
Maybe he's lying to you?
Vehicle references.
Wrong cabinet.
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
No, it has a mind of its own.
My hands?
Yes.
What color was it?
No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
Hamlet. Have you read it?
No.
No.
Oh.
You just asked me to ask you questions.
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
No, Wordsworth .. Do you like poetry?
Pray?
I was married to her sister ..
How d'you know what I'm like?
Ross told me.
Really? What did he say?
He said that? What else did he say?
Which is what?
Fifty-seven .. I don't mind ..
No I'm not.
Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
It's not possible right now.
Why?
No .. not now ..
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
<u>Then explain it to me</u>. I got enough darkness, don't I?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
I can't identify him ..
He don't know that. I didn't.
Then why didn't he kill me?
I know about alcohol, John.
I'm blind because my father drank.
I wanna be near you ...
I don't want them to arrest you.
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
Yes, Sir.
Who sought the warrant?
The man from the F.B.I.
Yeah, I guess I do.
Two or three years ago.
What was she like?
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
Don't mix very well with beer.
I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
Even better.
She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
Well, that's who she is. Cept she can't run away.
I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
Got a handshake like a partially excited penis.
I'm already walking. Where is it?
No, Sir.
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
I think I've found a hand.
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been better. Never BETTER!!
I know about the bachelor party.
One of the accountants.
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
You are not a loser.
Let's go.  I'll drive you. _ 45.
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
Jerry!  Do something --
I have to finish my job --
Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --
Look, I don't want a --
No.
It's over --
There is something missing here.
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense.
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
Still going.
I see what you're saying.
Wait.  What do you mean?
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.
Bill, Rod, wait --
Oh, tell the story.
Now what did you lose?
Well, take care.
And have fun at your bachelor party.
No no. I knew.
Oh tsht. Yes.
Same to you.
Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
It's all going to work.
Happy for us.
Call me later, hon.
Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
Hi.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
I'm glad you're home.  That "alone" thing is... not my specialty...
Yeah, thanks.
Good idea.  Thank you.
We will be fine!
-- especially one like this.
And I am...
Sure.
What you wrote inspired me. _ 79.
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
Yeah, I did.
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
Good evening.
Actually he said "glad." _ 85.
Yeah, what happened there.
Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
Bye you guys. _ 88.
Good night.
Easy, easy --
Fine, I just --
And I appreciate that impulse.
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
So I'll see you this weekend.
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
Okay... I will...
Why do you love me?
What --
Tell me -- let me help --
You want...
I don't know --
...my soul or something. _ 117.
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
I think we made a mistake here.
So this break... is a break-up.
Come on, Jerry.  You know this isn't easy for me.  _ 118.
Of course, medical! _ 42.
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
He's in the living room asleep.
At eleven at night? _ 70.
Thanks.
You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go.
It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
I'll give it everything.
Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
Let's do it again.
I might call you later!
Very much.
No, I air-dry.
No, I'm saying to be --
Forget it.  Forget it.
No tell me. _ 84.
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
Good deal, man.
What do you know about dating a single mother?
Then you gotta have The Talk.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
What's that supposed to mean?
You don't want to go home, do you?
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
I'm asking you a question --
No, you're --
Damn right.
Beautiful.
Only 'cause my wife likes your wife!
Go.  Flee.
I missed ya.  What can I say?
What --
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
But wait...
Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
Not a chance.
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
What DO you stand for???
Don't be silly.
I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
I'm fine.  What's up?
I came here to let you go. _ 27.
Came here to fire you, Jerry.
I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
Dick.
Thanks.  May I offer you both a ride?
They do, my brother.
I'm not your brother!
Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
Yeah I know.  I did.
Funny.
Right up ahead, buddy --
It's in a cage.  Do not be scared of...
What'd I say?
Quiet!
This is how you play God.
What is it?
A bird cage.
What's a bad idea?
Nothing you haven't seen before.
People change.
So do you.
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.
Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
What?
Nothing.
What did you say?
Nothing.
What did you say!
Just drop it Paul!
I filmed this the morning they left.
Eric!
He's this way.
We have to help him.
When did you have it last?
I don't remember
Think.
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
You mean it?
He's not a kill, he's still alive.
Where is it?
DAD!
Just hold on.
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
I thought you were an expert.
Dr. Grant was.
It won't hold!
We'll be broke in four weeks.
Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.
They're here.
What?
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
I don't think so.
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
They never got that big.
Baryonyx?
I don't remember that on InGen's list.
Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
KEEP GOING!
NO!
I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!
Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
Really?  What do you do there?
My favorite.
I try not to.
To a degree we never imagined.
Goodbye, Alan.
Alan don't be afraid to evolve.
In Costa Rica?
On the island.
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
Yeah.
What did you think?
Are you sure?
Why?
No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
Something must've scared them.
You're right.
No we're not.
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
Sure you have. You wrote that book...
Back out! Move!
Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
Just a little bit too much, I think.
How do you mean?
It certainly does.
No.  I feel something.
Minimal.
Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
It doesn't matter what I think.
Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
-- my --
-humidity, I know.  Highest lead density on the market.
Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
Everyone, keep your voices down!
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
Kelly!  What are you doing here?
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
My vacation is over in a week.
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
Which one?
That was about a year ago.
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
That Richard.
Where does it say that?
Come on!
What?  Why?
Good lad.
To collect my fee.
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
Isn't it obvious?
The velociraptors.
Piss.
Operations building.  Far end of the street.
Why?
Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
You version of it.
It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
Piss.
Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
Oh, God.
She's nuts.
Oh, my God.
You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
Our chance to do what?
What do you think they want?!
No way.
No.
What are they?
I don't know.
Where's Kelly?
She's with Sarah!
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
I have to find Kelly!
I think she's with Sarah!
DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
What's that?
Why did you come here?
So that others would know about this place?
Because it exists.
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
Four, counting the one in the chamber.
Funded by whom?
John Hammond.
What?!
What?
These formations.  They're dried --
Birdshit?
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
You think this is all a joke?
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
I'm trying!
JUMP!
Where's Ian?
Can the kid walk?
It's not worth taking the chance, John.
So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
It could have been worse, John.  It could have been a lot worse.
The monitors are failing.
Where did the vehicles stop?
Uh - - about two million.
Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
'Bout thirty seconds.
Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
These are dilated.  Take a look.
They are?  I'll be damned.
That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
Pretty sure.
Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
Oh my God.
Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
They smell.
They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
The Cretaceous.
Anything else, you old fossil?
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
Small versions of adults, honey.
What kind of park is it?
The - - agility.  You're right!
We're out of a job.
Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!
Dilophosaurus.
Not just every six weeks.
Yeah, I know.
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
- - and swallows fresh ones.
Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
You can't hold it by yourself!
I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
The other car!
Alan!
They're not here.
Okay.
Stick to my heels.
Like hell it is!
I get ah - -
I know, it's very exciting.
And scary.
And scary.
Anti-nature.
Yeah.
Please - - chance it.
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. 
- - shut up.
Hola, bienvenido
What are we looking for?
Dilophosaurus.
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
People were gettin' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - -
In a box under my seat.
Are they heavy?
Yeah.
Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
I've never been a rich man.  I hear it's nice.  Is it nice?
Oh, yeah - - great.
Tim.
Whichever one you are.
I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
Maybe -- it's hard to say.
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
A Do-you-think-he-saurus Rex.
It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?
But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
Try to!
You have no idea.
Yeah, they hate me.
You want to talk about this?
I didn't say you were scared.
I know.
Fine.
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
Relatively.
What?  What can we do?
There's gotta be something - -
For today, I guarantee it.
John Hammond.  And I am delighted to finally meet you in person Dr Grant.
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
For a further three years.
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
Let's get outta here!
Who?
After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
That's not what I'm going to do.  Good!
It's safe.
It's safe.
No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.
Oh, I hate the other kind.
All night?
All night.
You're a beautiful big animal.
Please!
Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick!
Timmy!  Do as he says!  Timmy!  Do as Dr. Grant says, quick!
Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
I certainly have!  Very clearly!  Because of the behavior of the system in phase space!
Don't do that!
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
Thanks for the presents.
We love the presents.
Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!
Why did you do this?
I don't know!  I'm sorry!
What if we fall?  I hate trees.
They don't bother me.
Yeah, you weren't in that last one.
They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.
That means they only eat vegetables.  But for you, I think they'd make an exception.
That was great!
I'm afraid I am gonna fall!
Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
Ken, we've been through this...
Yeah?
I think we're lost.
You have a map.
You learn something new every day. Let's go.
I want to look at the rest of the house.
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
Where's Ken? Is he all right?
What about that other guy?
Other guy?
He... he's here...
Who's there?
Jas... Jason Voorhees... he's here...
What?
His camera... it's still recording.
_Krueger_...
Who?
Come on.
Compared to this guy... amateur.
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
He's fucking nuts.
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
How do we prove it?
That's open to debate.
He's my client, and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
Me too. I'm drunk.
Yeah, what is it?
Add it to the list.
So what do we do?
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
Then we're all in a lot of trouble.
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
About ten minutes.
Ten minutes...
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
Up there.
Yes -- that's us.
Yes -- we do.
Have you worked here long?
No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.
What was the matter with it?
You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society.
You were his friend.  One link is all they need.
Perhaps Eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced.
I don't know what you could have read.
Just what you've published.
-- In magazines nobody reads.
I read the one about the penal colony.
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
A man must eat --  And drink.
The <u>Castle</u> cemetery.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
Yes.
It's my last and final one.
Then its authority is in doubt.
A true friend would do it.
Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
No, I left it in his office.
Did you see him?
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
It's what I'm paid to do.
You're detestable.
And you're late!
Sit down, Kafka.
In a small way.
Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
Why would you suppose so?
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
One of you must be mistaken.
I've never seen you here before.
Have you looked?
Two or three months, that's all.  -- I seduced him.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
When I have no reason to doubt.
Tonight?
Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
Eduard wanted to marry me.
And you ...?
You won't have any trouble finding it.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
Why were you given notice?
They're not obliged to tell.
I wouldn't put it past him.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
Where you've been employed for seven years.
Eight -- and seven months.
Was he depressed?
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
What makes you think so?
... Just a perception.
What did she say?
You mean you've actually begun some?
It's a farce.
-- Oh, yes, it's mad.
Lying in the gutter where they belong.
He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
Oskar.
And we're upset too.
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
Ludwig?
Here too!  They're all in a dreadful muddle!
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
What's to become of us now?
Amerika for us!
Amerika!
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
Now Ann ...
All in due course, Ann. Our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to London.
Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
Do they have him on display at the weekends?
No!
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
I can't imagine you crying.
Leave it, Ann.
We're leaving.
Jack!...  Jack!
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
Oh my God ... Ann?
An ape ... some kind of ape.
That's your monkey, Denham.
Kong ...
How about Ann? Is she going with you?
Yeah.
Why?
Coz of something I lost.
Compassion.
What's compassion, mister.
Can't you see I'm strung out?  Please, we're waiting for it -- he's got to have it!
Did he come around often?
She was with you after she left Frank.
Guess!
Do you always have to repeat?
Look -- could I use your phone?
Yes indeed.
Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
Why isn't he locked up?
I guess he figured it was better.
What was better? I made better bait?
No, that's not --
-- We can talk --
-- Yes.
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
Will you let me go then?
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
I said yes, I see.
Oh no, I don't think --
My name's John Klute.
You said that.
Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?
What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
I can't say he was anybody!
How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
OK.
-- OK?
I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
Can't you get him?
Well, let's go down and ask him.
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
You said you wanted these.
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
I don't see anything, do you?
What're you gonna do next?
Try some other ways. 
You said it was!
No, I said what did you think.
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
Not much point to this, is there?
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
-- Then you don't need me.
But if it's someone else I do.
The same as Jane McKenna.
I don't get you.
Ligourin: How could you do it?
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
We did this before.
What am I supposed to say?
I was wondering what that was.
Hell there's nothing so mysterious about the square life.
Don't touch anything.
Go down in my room.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
How do you know how bad it was?
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
You're going back?
Mm.
I am.
I believed her, Pete.
I better keep looking.
Where, how?
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
Just send me a money order.
No, I'd -- like to be in on it.
I wanted to give it to you first.
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
Goodbye, Pete.
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
Town Police.
Then how are you involved?
I know Tom Grunemann.
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
We grew up together. Kids.
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
Yeah.
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
What else do you know?
No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
Yes?
Good.  I'll see him in there.
Not particularly.
What does?
Very well, I'd like to see him if I may.
I see you have people there. What are their names?
Oh, sure.  Here, this can be mommy.
Do you like to be with your mommy?
What do you like best about your daddy?
My daddy doesn't hit me, silly. Why would my daddy hit me?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
Show.
On earth.
Soon.  Very soon.
Right.  One O.J. coming up.
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
Will she pick me up after school?
You got a letter from mom.
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
Yeah?
I guess...
Uh huh...
We use the green and yellow.
That's okay.
I hate it.
All it is is onions and gravy.
I'm allergic to onions.
You are not allergic of onions.
Oh, for God's sake...Here.
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
Then eat around it.
No.
I want my mommy...I want my mommy..
Tough shit.  You're stuck with me.
Yeah?
I'm sorry...
Uh huh?
You mean for good?
Oh...
Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
See you in the morning light.
I love you...
See you in the morning light...
Sure.
Sure.  Lots of times.
It's my name too.
You like it?
Is that really your chair?
Uh huh...
No, she never did.
Are you going to get remarried?
I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
Boy, I bet you if mommy ever saw this she'd remarried you.
Uh, huh?
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Uh, uh...We didn't have television then.
Yeah, there was apple juice.
Was there Burger King?
What don't you understand, pal?
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Your mom.
Overruled.
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
Did you wish to?
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
And what is your present salary?
I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.
Yes.  Very much.
And yet you chose to leave him?
Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child?
Objection!
And did you have a close personal relationship?
I understand and I'm absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up....  ...after the first of the year.
Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--
A heavy drinker?
No.
Was he unfaithful?
No.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
I don't recall.
I...I don't know...
How long was that?
So, you were a failure at the longest, most important relationship in your life.
Yes.
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think--
No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
I'm not taking him with me.
I don't know...
So do you.
Fine.
You have?
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
Joanna, go fuck yourself!
Ted, do you love him?
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Ted, do you love him?
Only can I still see him?
No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
Jim, I've got to go.  I'm already late--
Yes, what?
Yes, I'll have dinner with you.
Kramer...
I'm going to take it.
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
Do you want the kid or don't you?
I lost him?  I lost him?
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.
I'll take my chances.
It's going to cost.
Don't worry.  I'll get the money.
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
It's beautiful.  It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.
Yeah.
Any prospects?
How the hell are you going to do that?
John, what if she kidnaps him.
Ten.
Mr. Kramer, there's--
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
Ted, don't be so hostile.
I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
You're on your own, understand?
I understand.
You're sure?
I'm sure.
Three.  And add some basil.
Uh, huh...Yeah...
What?
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
Any day.
Uh, huh...
Please, Thel...
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
A moment.
Yes. I am ready.
Yes, Holiness.
Kham, Holiness.
Again?
Tell me.
It is alright, Father.
Can I do anything I want?
But, I am in charge.
Are you? Of whom?
And you have horses? You love horses.
Will you buy the sheep for me?
Where will you keep them?
Here. We'll collect them.
I will buy them for you.
Can I free the prisoners?
Hmmm.
No!
We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
General Chiang.
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
Thank you. Please sit.
I have a copy for you.
The Sera monks have surrendered?
It is calm.
We did not.
I am afraid.
Time to study.
Yes.
Far, far away.
Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.
We do not know.
Do I have money?
What do you think?
Do you have money?
Not until you are eighteen.
Roughly five thousand men.
Is that big?
No. Not very big.
No. This war is almost over.
Will we ever be in war?
It is an island. American territory.
Where is Alsace?
I do not know, Holiness.
He warned about the future of Tibet.
When it is time.
What is the danger from the Chinese, now?
And, America?
In the Americas.
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
I had relinquished doubt.
The people will not allow it.
Good day.
Please, come in, so cold.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
You decide.
What do you think?
True.
You decide.
Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
I have smarter men.
As you say.
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
The Chinese.
Yes.
Ahh.
Where is Poland?
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
No, Holiness.
Am I running away?
You have grown up very good.
It may not be your decision to make.
You are unharmed?
Completely.
It is a difficult situation.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
Too young?
Much too young.
Oh, yes.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.
Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
It happens when I land.
Why are we landing?
<u>So</u> <u>why</u> <u>are</u> <u>we</u> <u>landing</u>?  <u>Hector</u>.
I need to see his habitat.
<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
I do <u>not</u> like you.
What the hell are you doing?!!
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
You're crawling around like a--
I'm laying a spring trap!
A spring trap!
This could end up saving your life,--
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
No crocodile has ever--
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
Yup.
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
It came from across the lake.
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
Then do it!!
I don't know!
Get the gun.
Bastard bit my chopper.
Hey!!
'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
That's actually the easy part.
You ready on shore?
We're ready.
You do?
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
You talk to Bickerman?
Just those two.
As if.  Will you miss me?
Are you sure?
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
Excuse me?
No.
Eh.  Fuck it.
Could we have intercourse?
Guess I finally got bit.
Yeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix it.
Yeah.  Thanks to you.
Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
Are we all museum bigots in Maine?
Never been to Maine before?
I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks.
What?
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
I'd be able to see something.
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
It's too dangerous for--
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
You flew up here because your boss--
Good.
'Night.
Good luck.
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
Um... y'know...  Yeah.
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
You <u>did</u>, you--
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
It's okay.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
Night.
What?
I heard something.
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
I'm not mushing it.
You're mushing it a little around the--
<u>I'm</u> <u>not</u> <u>mushing</u> <u>it</u>.
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
Really--
You calm down!
<u>Calm</u> <u>down</u>.
Look.
Good idea.
Well...
He's floating.  Take it home.
Hector.
You wouldn't?
Keep firing!
Take him.
I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
He heeds a tourniquet.
But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
Likewise.
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
I'll call the coroner.
White perch.
Are they feeding?
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
They look like they're jumping.
Obviously I was wrong!
I'll take it!
Hector.  <u>Do</u> <u>not</u> <u>move</u>.
You too.
Did he say anything?
Yes.
I'm fine, thank you.
This is a little different.
I can look at dead things.
Not yet.
I got nothing against--
Ever even been <u>in</u> one?
It's just that--
Sheriff.
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
I thought I saw...
It looks like a branch.
You threw it at me!!
I just let go of it.
I asked you to be nice to him.
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
Hector thinks you like him.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
You think Jack's handsome?
What is this?
Yes.
He said he knew Karate!
Look.
I don't know.  Back the truck--
Wait.
Kevin, hey.
You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
Yes, well...  famished.
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
I'm not even a field person.
Well on this one I'd like you to be.
No.
Liar?
Myra.
Shitbutt?
Never cock. Just squeeze.
I love it when you talk dirty.
Thanks, Ardelia.
Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
Why does she keep repeating the name?
Why not?
What girl?
But why? He didn't weight the others.
Hot damn, Clarice.
Agent Mapp! Thank you!
You're all right! Where is he?
Get me out!
Shut UP!  The other officers will be here any minute! you're perfectly safe now!
Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.
But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company.
Okay, Mr. Yow...
That wasn't me.
Oh.
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
Not yet! - just wait for me.  Maybe in about two seconds.
No. Wait... Was she a great, fat person? I may have seen her, I'm not sure...
I think we may be, yes.
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
Murdered...? How?
Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
You do until six p.m.
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
May I see your credentials?
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
Maybe they'll catch up.
I have no doubt of it.
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
Memory, Officer Starling, is what I have instead of view.
How many women has he used, our Bill?
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
No. You ate yours.
Reasonably so. Yes.
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Why? Do you know something about him?
Ahhh... Why?
Because you weren't wasting my time.
Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
Big through the hips. Roomy.
They all were.
Mmm. And what else...?
A moth... How did you predict that?
Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
How long did you live there?
Two months.
Why so briefly?
I - ran away...
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
Did he try to?
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
What was it?
Yes...! They were screaming.
So you ran away...
Thank you, Clarice.
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
Dr. Chilton... I believe you know each other?
Did you breast-feed her?
No fair! You lured him with produce.
Officer Starling. Welcome back.
We leave in the morning?!
Yes, miss.
Absolutely.
Well that is to be expected. My father...
Why did they turn back?
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
What would you have me do?
Maybe...
Alice?
I have nothing to go back for.
My letter...
What?
There was no letter.
I sent three men to Webb!
Aversion?  No... "Hatred"... "Loathing"...
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
Yes. Yes, I will.
It can be dangerous...
He delivered no such message.
I am sorry, Duncan...
What the bloody hell plan is this?
What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
...Fort William Henry.
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
Dark haired...
No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
Fort Edward, then?
No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?
Do not let gratitude get in the way...
Excuse me...
That is the truth!
We don't.
I don't understand!
: Only one or two loads.
I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
...No...Do not call myself much of a subject at all.
We'll see in the morning...
You're not coming with us?
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
Yes, sir.
The decision is final.
Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
Fire!!!
Sir!
Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
Wampum?
Yes.
For Munro children?
Yes.
The King? The King has mountains of gold!
Heart. Give Magua new heart.
Granted.
My colors?
Allow me to consult with my officers.
France.
Le mot d'ordre?
La victoire.
Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
I'm not a doctor.
For this...you don't need to be.
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
Intelligence may not be the right word...
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
What has?
Were, Doss <u>were</u>.
Can you fix it?
No way...
I am thinking, man!  You think I want to die!  I am thinking!  I--
No!
That's an order!
Fuck your orders!
I got hung up!  Try this!
Just get in yours!
Huh?  I...uh...uh...
What?
Still...you did the right thing.
Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
You screw around like that again and--
Good...It's going good.
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
The escape bubbles?
Seeing how my stock's doing...
How much time does that give us?
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
Where's Jones?
I can't see them!
Where's Doc?!
He's not at his station.
...I'd really have to show it to you.
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
What's your air reading?
Twenty minutes...
Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
Ahhhh!
Okay.
Not yet.
How's TransOcean doing?
I signed-up for the stock option.
Hook's on 24...
Russian.
...and a Russian grandmother...
It...almost got you.
What was it?
Itches like hell.
Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.
What music?  There ain't no music.
Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
I'm going to kill it!
Twelve hours!
Under there?
Two hundred meters.
We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
I'm going to try to remove it.
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
It's had a meal.
Like a leech.
Let's hope it holds.
Sixpack...
How is he?
I ought to smack your face!
DeJesus...It's got him.
Oh man, that's just great...
The good doctor signed our death warrant.
The air's stopped.
Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...?
Don't worry, darlin, I'm...
Seven hundred for the pair.
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
A traffic warden. Look, what's this?
The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
Well what?
I thought this was a pub.
It's a Samoan pub.
You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.
Like antiques.
You get the guns?
I don't know what you mean.
There were two old guns there; where are they?
I am not fucking interested.
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
Where did he get a hundred grand?
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
Fucking Northern monkeys.
Can I help?
Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
They were going to pay, then?
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
I am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John.
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
Just carrying a bag.
Let's have a look, shall we?
Try that one.
Well, put your seatbelt on then.
Sure is.
What can I do for you?
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
Jesus, I have heard about him.
The stupid bastards! Count it!
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
I didn't touch him, he just passed out.
Just give me the keys.
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
OK, open the gate.
How about you? All right?
There is only three of us here.
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Out the back.
And the weed?
Out the back.
Invitations?
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
What do you mean?
I mean it's fucking empty.
He means they're thieving dogs.
Why, what's up?
Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
Right as rain.
What do you mean, me?
. . . What?
I'11 meet you in the car.
I'll only be a minute.
A hundred grand.
Never mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that.
Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
You will what?
I will loan you the money.
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
For half a million?
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.
It's pay day, ain't it?
I like your bar.
Yes?
I want your bar.
And?
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
Lives and learns doesn't one.
Of course you are. All right, Ed.
You know how much it is, Nick.
And that does include the amp?
You know it doesn't include the amp.
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
Rory Breaker is standing by. You stand to make a lot of money, Tommy boy.
You've already been fifteen.
At what, exactly?
My van is half full.
So?
You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
You would take a pain n the arse full stop.
Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.
Er, well, twelve.
Er, fertilizer.
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
Leave your sister out of it.
--you're going to be on your own.
Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
They stole our land--
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
I-I can do the job, sir.
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
I am, sir.
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
Who's "they"?
The--the officers.
I mean, follow orders, sir.
Because it's a job?
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
You're dismissed.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
And you and Private Graves--
We were just dancing--
Sergeant?
I'm feeling okay--
September '97, that's all she wrote.
Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
Skinny?
That badge--
Everybody on the border knows that story.
You got a cause of death?
A .45--
He swore by it.  What?
Just wondering.
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
You're fired. You're outta the department.
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
Best part of the job.
What?
Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam.
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
Come on in--
If it's too late--
Come on in.
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
Uncle Al--
He never asked her.
Go out through the back.
He a Black man or an Indian?
Same as they done in Mexico.
But they were Indians themselves.
They were in the Army. Like your father.
You know who I am?
I got a pretty good guess.
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
Didn't have a father?
He's still pissed off about it.
"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"
No.
Yeah. He lives here, right?
Fifteen years in El Paso.
Made some money, came back here--
Something like that.
Lead mine.
It's a lead mine.
Right.
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
You going to get married?
Maybe.
Yeah?
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
We been through this before--
We should just do it.
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
Man's gonna retire in two years and he offer to quit. Big goddamn deal.
Masons been around a long while.
If the next guy's a redneck.
Yeah. I bet he would.
I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
That's where he fell.
You get much of that in here?
Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
Why would you want to do that?
Because I'm your father.
No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
Bandidos, Injuns--
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]
No te molestas. Tenemos a ella. [Don't worry. We've got her.]
Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
Buenas noches, Senora Cruz. Enrique walks in the opposite direction--
Quien es? [Who is it?]
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
I have some friends who have had a accident--
You have somebody else out there?
We was crossin' the river--
They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
I thought you were married!
Tipico.
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
Don't worry about it. He owes me some favors.
Hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
That Buddy was a cool breeze.
--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--
That's a matter of interpretation--
We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd.
Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
I haven't been out here for a while.
You go by your old house?
We found a body out by the Army base yesterday. Been there for a long time.
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
We have a murder?
Charley Wade.
Do you?
Hey, Sam.
Open late.
Buddy Deeds was a murderer.
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
Steve?
Your mother's family is Spanish?
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
The Sheriff.
You told me one time it was true love.
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
Right. When he was killed.
A little older than Paloma is now.
How come you never got married again?
I was too busy.
Nobody's too busy.
I don't mean Fernando.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
I never said that. It was just that boy--
"That boy"--Mami, say his name for chrissakes!
That's me.
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
You ever play one of these?
I've seen 'em.
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
He had the club out on the old trail road--
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
Not if I can help it.
You had to deal with him in running the club.
Okay? He's not here?
No. Is he sick?
He's going to wish he was dead.
And that was the last time you saw him?
Could of been. That was white people's business.
And when my father was Sheriff?
What was your deal with him?
What?
Yeah?
You gonna stay out here?
For a while.
What do you think?
It's Saturday.
You got in late last night.
Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
I only went for my last two years.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
Time marches on.
How much you got left?
Three months.
I got a bad stomach. It helps me digest.
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
They've got my Amado.
Got him here?
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
I'll see what's going on.
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
Most people did, yeah.
Weird what you remember.
Amado.
Nice-looking kid.
He hates me.
No--
They've got me. Different thing.
Pilar--
Yeah.
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
So what are we gonna do about this?
Two years.
I've felt that way, yeah.
Yeah?
What was your father's name?
Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.
Couple months before I was born--
Yeah--
Yeah.
I been working on a few things.
Gotta be in person.
Oh.
You'd do a good job.
How 'bout you?
Don't know if I'll still want it.
I didn't want to be going around your back.
I appreciate you telling me.
You don't need to cuff me.
Otis, apologize to the Sheriff--
No, Sheriff, I'm just--
And people better clear out of here! Now!
What's up?
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
You sell much out here?
But you don't see much competition, do you?
Me neither.
Name's Otis.
Otis what?
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
Uh-huh.
Why you think that was?
Been away. Up to Houston.
You going to tell him?
He doesn't need to know all my business.
He's gonna find out.
So? What's he gonna do, arrest us?
Thirty-five bucks.
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
You bet.
Nix.
Nix?
Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
Who is he?
It'll be something hokey.
You ever been married?
I love weird.
doorway) And who's that?
A Nix specialty?
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
Right.
Isn't that French for something?
That's so cool.
Why would I do that?
Beats me.
I told you --
All right.  It was...
I know him.  I saw him.
Death.
What about death?
It's an illusion.
I could scoop them out.
Don't.
I don't know.
Not yet.
It's him... it's him.
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
Maybe he'll show you.
Be ready.
He's with us... He's with us...
Yes.
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
Harry.
I'm no bodyguard.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
Why?  Because he had you?
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
You didn't marry him for love.
That's my business. Harry.
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
Yes.  You do that.
He was the real thing, right?
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
Some or it.
What then?
I'm here, aren't I?
Nothing you don't want.
Are you sure?
I'm sure.  He's dead.
I know.  I'm the one who shot him.
Yes.
Quaid and Jennifer--
It's okay.
Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
Hang on!
You can't.
I'm here, Harry.
Yes.
I... have... to.
I'm okay.  I'm okay.
I think so.
Harry-?
Good.  There.  Yes?
No word from D'Amour?
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
Sure.
Somebody killed him.
Oh God.
I just saw him.
--vanished.
Another fucking magician. Jesus.
I heard he was the best.
If he was so good why's he so dead?
I'd like to hear them.
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
He was a freak.  Everything he did was tainted.
Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
Mr. D'Amour?
Go away.
It's one in the afternoon.
What are you, my mother?
I'm here to offer you a job.
I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
Mine.
Somebody's been smoking in here for months.
You know of him?
I saw him in Vegas once.
Are you a gambling man?
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
Probably.
Are you a believer, then?
Swann's wife.
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
Why'd you come here?
Yes.  It's regrettable
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
What for?  You need to stay busy?
I like to know why things happen.
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
I'm afraid she's not in.
When will she be in?
Yeah, I know.
You want more money, is that it?
Shut up!
Was that Swann's idea?
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
Shit...
Help me.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
What about?
A Mister Quaid?
She has no real grip on reality.
Yeah.  You could say that.
Yes...
Who is he?
What?
That.
Harry D'Amour.
Sure.  Vivovich.
People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
For an introduction.
Well... nobody.
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
How the fuck do you do that?
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
He deserved it.
Oh yeah?
It's me betrayed him.
Will that do?  No?
Didn't know you read minds.
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
Yes.
Jesus!
Looks that way.
He's better off this way.
Nobody's better off this wav!
You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
In my time, and nobody else's.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
You didn't try hard enough.
I can't... I can't go any further...
Can you do it?
I don't know.
Try.
Call me tomorrow.
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
A couple of weeks.
What?
Who is she?
No.
What about Philip Swann?
I knew Swann.  He's a fucking liar.
Who's not?
Is he the Puritan?
Yes! Yes!
And he's dead?
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
Binding you.
Why would I want to?
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
Liar!
Bob, it's me.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
You'll do it?
Yeah, I'll stay.
Two years.
Try twenty-five.
What do you do?
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
What did you study?
Philosophy.
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
Not really. How long are you here for?
I'm here for the week.
I know, it's stupid.
I know. I don't either.
It's Charlotte.
I see them every morning.
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
Yeah, you don't remember?
No, you smiled.
I don't remember.
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
No, I was looking at you.
You're possessive.
I know.
No, yes, it does...
Yeah? But look at you.
That's ok.
And marriage, does that get easier?
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
We established that we have no communication.
No one ever tells you that...
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
You are.
How old is she?
Four.
Oh, she'll love it.
Fuck off.
We should get you to the doctor.
Yeah, look at that thing.
Working.
Do you ever see him?
Yeah.
Yes, but no, I can't right now.
I don't want to be.
A coke.
Around.
That lunch was the worst, huh.
Tomorrow.
I'm going to miss you.
That's what you said the other night.
Well, I mean it more now.
Hi, Bob.
That'd be great.
Yes.
Well... have a good flight.
Thanks.
Ok, bye.
I'll miss you.
Yes?
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Oh?
Can I enter?
Yes?
Do you like massage?
I don't think so.
Mr. Kazuzo send Premium Fantasy.
Take them.
Hello, darling.
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
Bob?
Hi, Lydia.
Is this a bad time?
Uh, no.
It's just carpet.
That's not what I'm talking about.
What are you talking about?
Is there anything I can do?
You know, eat healthier.
Alright?
Not all that pasta.
Fine.
Like Japanese food.
Hello, Bob, it's me.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
Fine. Is it going ok?
It's ok.
Do you want to- 
What?
That's ok.
When are you coming home?
Tomorrow.
Thank you, Mr. Harris.
Hospital?
One moment, please.
Hello, can I have room 5601.
One moment.
What?
Evelyn Waugh was a man.
Why do you have to defend her?
Good...I'm tired.
You wanna come?
Sure.
Ok.
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
What?
I got some hair stuff.
I don't know.
Ok, I will... later.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
I gotta go... and I don't really like champagne.
Are you sure you have to go?
It'll just be a few days.
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
Promoting that action movie I did...
No!  Hi! So great to meet you!
It's probably trivial.
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Uh...sure...I...what?
Sushi.
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
Now that you're on TV, you're a magnet for all the wackos out there.
No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
What happened?
When did they find her?
I can't believe Will killed him.
Thank God he did.
I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
I'm just temporarily off my game.
I believe in you.
I found them in your file box.
Must be a spare set.
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
Peter, are you okay?
Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
Yes.  It's exactly...
Eight.  That okay?
Quiet.  Real quiet...
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
You have to tell me who did it.
Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
It's the patient's request, doctor.
You heard voices, you know you did.
I hope so.
You have a sister in New Orleans.
Something he said, just before...
He spoke to you?
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
Just open the door, please.
What do you mean "don't worry?"
Yes.  We won, that's right.
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.
...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
Well I know he's come here before.
What's his name?
You just call?
I didn't know what else to do...
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
Peter Kelson?
Yes... and you are?
Thank you.  Do you work in the building? You coming from the party?
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
And also that...
Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
What if I told you I was a malignant narcissist?
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
I think you gave me the wrong one.
What do you mean?
You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
Peter, please...
The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
I'm going to look around.
What's the...OH SHIT!
When's your birthday?
What?
That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
What's the bible for?
Comfort.
We're going to do this.
You have to say that.
I was desperate.  I knew you wrote about murders.  I needed a way in.
Maybe that's my problem.
What are these?
And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
Not a lot.
Whish the circumstances were different.
I know who he is.
Maya?  What do you mean?
I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
A lot of good that'll do.
We need all the help we can get.
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
I'm not waiting until it's too late.
You are the younger of two...
Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
Goodbye.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
He can see you Thursday.
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
It's Detective Smythe.
We millionaires yet?
Of course.
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
Yeah, yeah.  I've heard it before.  Just be sure you spell my name right.  Nine o'clock?
He's looking right at me.
I'll quit, maybe you should start.
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
You got the right attitude, anyway, look, we gotta talk.
She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13.
Yeah, murder-suicide.
What happened?
She told me she killed them.
Nothing.
Oh, all that work.
I can't eat before a game.
Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised to see you.
He's still at the bank.
Need any help?
I can manage.
To that stewardess?
Yeah, you met her?
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
There you go.
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
The blue.
You sure?
Thanks, sweetheart.
Okay.
You want the job or not?
You're cold?
Careful.
That was two words.
Then I'll get you some punch.
Uh-huh.
Shh.  It's okay.
Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.
You could make a career by telling me where.
Gotta wait til the press conference.
I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
Yes, we appreciate that.
Get used to it, babe.
Four days.
No.
Mom's going to hate it.
Always on my ass, anyway.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
Just try and chill a little bit, alright.
I found you someone.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
I know...
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
This brother from my college.
He's in college?
And he's fine, girl.
How'd you get him to say yes?
You do.
Yeah, right.
Too many times.
They ever love you back?
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
I was just showing emotion.
Chances are there's still a chance.
Dad.  What are you doing here?
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
So how's the job going?
I'll take that as a compliment.
You were trying to make me look bad.
Didn't have to try very hard.
Just wanted to say good game.
What's up, Sidra.
How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian?
You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
I wouldn't know.
Lucky.
Uh huh.
I just can.
He works at a bank.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
I don't care.
Oh.
Okay.
For how long?
Five seconds.
My Dad always drives my Mom.
Man, forget you then, stupid.
I know this.  What do you want?
Your legs don't look broke.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
Guess "please" would be a stretch.
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
Your hot-ass temper.
Would you watch the damn road?
Didn't know you cared so much.
I don't.
Good.
Yeah.
You don't look half-bad.
You either.
Hey.
You having fun?
Yeah.
Guess not.
So you took Shawnee, huh?
Figures.
What?
I know, right?
What'd it say?
I can't be nice to a fan?
Quit.
What are we playing for?
Clothes.
What?
My court, I go first.
Plan to.
Right here.
I wanted you to.
Why not?
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
Quincy...
What's up?
It happens, right...
Nobody.
Who's nobody?
You want to go talk?
Not really.
Hey, what's up.
Woman...
What the hell's going on?
We're going to get some food.
Are you out of your mind?
Talk to your new girlfriend.
Least she had time for me.
Least you got your priorities straight.
I never asked you to choose.
Never had to.
Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me?  Go fuck Dick Vitale.
You don't think so?
Look, I'm entering the draft.
You're what?
Few days ago.
So that's it, just forget about us?
Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
What are the doctors saying?
I forgot, "Q-man."
We won the championship.
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
Kiss my ass.
Oh yeah?
What do you mean?
Who's this guy I always see her around?
So...how's the knee?
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
Maybe go back to school.
Why do you keep asking me that?
Cause I don't get it.
Something was just missing.
What?
We need to talk.
It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
Wrong.
What?
For what?
So you're gonna bitch up?
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
There's so many I just can't keep track.
Well, can you give him this for me?
I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.
Business folks.
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
Keep your voice down.
What's that, not great?
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
He tore his ACL.
Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
We still have to go?
Yeah.
Uh, your earring?
I've been hearing you.
Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
Yup.
Said he'd be home later.
Later when?
Sorry.  You okay?
I'm fine.
This is just about money, you know that.
I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
You don't wanna hurt your back.
You know, people.
I just told you.
Still is, so let yourself out.
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
And some things should never fucking happen!
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
Came by to check on you.
After five years.
Good.
And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
Oral surgery.  Corrective teeth surgery.
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
You ok?
ooohhhhhh no.
What's wrong?
Hello, Phil.
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
Well can you connect me to someone else?
Well what's the situation?
Does this sound weird?
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
Brain and Lung.
My mother had breast cancer.
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
Oh that's good.
It was scary though.
It's a helluva disease.
Sure is.  So why call me?
It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
GET OUT.
LAPD. Open the door.
It's the LAPD, can you open the door, please?
I'm coming!
Yeah, but I don't know --
You don't have a boyfriend?
No.
Who was it?
You just move in here?
About two years ago.
Bit messy.
I don't have a boyfriend.
That's great, thank you.
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
You take cream or sugar?
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
I don't have a boyfriend.
The gentleman who came to the door --
yeah, good, ok.
Bye, bye, Claudia.
Good bye.
What is it?  Did you forget something?
Well...is that illegal?
No.
Yeah.
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
It's my favorite place --
Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.
Bye.
Well I don't go out very much.
What?
You really use strong language.
I'm sorry --
-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.
I'm sorry.
...nothing.  I'm sorry...
ok.
Can I tell you something?
Yeah, of course.
What?
I've got troubles.
Say what you want and you'll see --
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
Yes I do.
Just say no.
just let me walk out, ok?
Yes.
Yes.
What's your name?
Claudia.
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
-- can I get you?
It doesn't matter.
Ready to go,go,go?
Where's Richard and Julia?
Have you ever been there?
Sure, why?
Cynthia?
What?
Not enough, what do you want?
Can you hold it?
Just hold it, you'll be fine.
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
I don't know, Richard, they need to talk it over --
Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --
We're not gonna do that now.  We're not gonna do that now and that's over.
BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT, DAD WE NEED TO GET HIS MONEY AND GO.
Son, don't --
GIVE US YOUR MONEY.
Put the gun down, please, boy.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
Son, please, now....
DAD --
That idea is over now. We're not gonna do that now.
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
That's confidential information, little man.
No.
I'm a rapper.
I ain't fuckin with you --
Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it.
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
Go. Hurry up. Let's go.
Finish it up without the lip.
Whatever that meant, I'm sure it's real helpful Ice-T.
I was listening --
What's up?
Fine.  Phil, you still there?
I'm about to get off the elevator --
Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
Do you have love in your heart?
Well --
No.  I mean, I'm telling you: I'm telling you that I have love.
You're a friend of the family I presume?
What?  What does that mean?
That's right.
Picky, picky.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
Mmm.Hmm.
You see?
Stay that way.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
Gently, son --
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
Don't Donnie. Don't do it.
Braces.
Braces?
Yes.
You don't need braces.
Yes I do.
Your teeth are fine.
Don't do this, Don.
I've been a good worker, Solomon. A hard and loyal --
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!
GIMME YOUR FUCKIN' KEYS.
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
Do you wanna sit down?
I need to sit down.
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
Fuckin' bullshit is right, in'it?
...ah...
Where is he?
Get a girlfriend.
I'm trying.
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
When was the last time you talked to your son?
....I dunn...o....maybe ten...five, fuck, fuck....that's another thing that goes --
I've seen it before.
Other fuckin' assholes like me.
There's no asshole like you.
Go fuck myself?
You got it.
I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --
Who are you gonna call?
Jack.
Is Jack your son?
Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
that'snotmy name...find Lily, gimmme that, give it --
...Lily...?
No.
....getthat on the tv....there...
Hi.  Is Frank there?
I think you have the wrong number.
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
No.
Is this 509-9027?
Yep.
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
-- let's talk more about your background --
Muffy -- coffee?
Is that still lingering?
-- just to clarify --
So boring, so useless --
Yes.
-- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
Not really.
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
She does.  From when you were a boy.
She lived in Tarzana.
What am I doing?
Yeah.
I'm quietly judging you.
So you sat it out, that's what you did?
Around here.
the valley?
Hollywood, mainly.
And what did your parents do?
Well I guess it doesn't.
Does you mother still work?
She's retired.
Are you close?
She's my mother.
"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
And your father?
He passed away.
I'm sorry.
people die.
I wouldn'tve asked --
Not a problem.
And you ended up at UC Berkely --
Psychology major?
Right.
Do you have your masters?
...this close...
In five years?
It's not your given name, right?
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
"Frank" was my mother's father.
...are you Phil...?
I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
Uh-huh.  What's going on?
About three weeks ago.
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
I'm really sorry.
He's in here --?
Yeah.
It's interesting.
Mmm.
...just wait...Dad...you want something...can you say...
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
You can't just come in here.
The door was open, I got a call --
Calm down.
Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
You're here.
I live alone.
Ok. What's your name?
Marcie.
I'm not askin', Marcie.
And what about screaming?
No.
Been drinkin' today?
It's ten o'clock in the morning --
I didn't hear anything.
I don't have to do a god damn thing.
Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --
THAT'S NOT MINE.
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
...you know...
Did your wife find out?
No.
Then what?
Yeah. Yes.
Will you say my name?
What happend to you?
I got in trouble at school.
Fuck no.
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
You want her right now?
Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
Are you alright?
Jean Baptiste Poquelin Moliere.
It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.
I'm drinking.
Slowly or quickly?
As fast as I can.
Come home soon after the show.
She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
Did you tell her?
Love you too..
Bye.
It'll take the pain away.
It's not really pain.
I'm a bad person.
Yeah.
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
I don't hate you, Jimmy.  But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....
Was there anyone that I know?
Who?
Rose, I don't --
hey.
Paula.  Ellen.
No one else that I know?
How long with Paula?
Two years...three years...
What about now?
Is it over 'cause you're sick?
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
Well maybe.
I don't.
I'm not through asking my questions.
Maybe...I don't...
Do you know the answer to this?
...No....
I don't know.
I really don't know.
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
I don't know what I've done.
Yes you do.
You should know better.
Hello.  Is Claudia here?
She's asleep.
Are you her boyfriend?
You're Jimmy Gator, right?
Yes.  What's your name?
I'm Bob.
You're her boyfriend?
Yeah.  She's sleeping now, I mean --
I'II go....is it...back here?
It's alright.
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.
No they don't --
I don't wanna do it.  Why can't one of you do it --
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
I'm trying to help, Linda --
You need to sober up.
I have to go.
Shut the fuck up.
What are you doing?
No, Linda, you don't understan --
PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.
Hi.
818-753-0088.
Partridge?
What would you like?
Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
mmm.hmm.
Water.
Bottled Water?
Do you have that?
That's it.
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
Thank you.
What do you do?
Shut up -- shut up --
-- the fuck are you talking about?
I need this one.
Should be one-thirty.
You're late, not me.
You coulda been in front --
-- I didn't see you from the window.
Sure.
See you.
I'm fine. nothing.
Why didn't you answer those questions?
I didn't know the answer --
Stand up.
I said I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
Hi.
..sorry...
It's ok.
Hi.
..sorry...
It's ok.
I hate it.
...what...?
No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
It's raining frogs from the sky.
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
This happens....this is something that happens.
God smiled upon us.
And you were not hurt?
No, M'lady.
M'lady...?
No, stay back!  Stay back!
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
D'Artagnan.
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
I am preparing for a ball!
I wish to discuss your brother.
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
He is your brother!
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
Shut up, knave!
Replace the king.
I am with you!
Making the key to the throne.
Come, we have a boat waiting.
A body.
His plight is obvious, isn't it?
Tomorrow.
You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.
I have it all worked out.
But -- what is Porthos doing?
Going into the barn naked -- or so it appears.
But -- what is he doing?
About to hang himself, I should think.
All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal.
Hold your goblet with two fingers.
You're a fool!
Perhaps he serves a different king.
To the Bastille.  And death.
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
You -- You cannot ask me to betray my king!  I have sworn to him!
You can't do it.
Pull them back!
Everyone back.
They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
Forgiveness?
Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
It is also a place of burial.
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
Catacombs.  Very holy.
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
What use am I?
We go someplace dangerous.
Why didn't you say so?
So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
Did she have tits like that?
The Queen Mother.  Anne.
We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
Raoul --
Athos, my friend!
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
I know.
Oh my friend.
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
Get out of my way.
Athos, I beg you --
To kill the king.
I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.
What is its antidote?
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either.
Porthos told me.
Your mother's.
She will be at the ball.
How did you --
Just... water.
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
Silence!  I order you!
Thank you, your Majesty.
It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
... tired.  Must... lie down.
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
Yes, your Majesty.
He is my brother.
There.
I must insist, Sire.
No, Keeper.
Thank you, Keeper.
... Two-thirty-seven.
What was the end page?
You may go, Lieutenant.
Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
Out directing the search for the traitors.
Shoot them!  Shoot them!
That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
A letter.  May I see?
Enough of this, our dinner waits.
It's lovely.  It's just...
No, you may wait behind the screen.
Yeah?
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
Every step of the way.
Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
What do you need?
You mean shut your ass down!
Where are you?
We're by Ozone...
You set to go -
What do you think?
Alright, stay on the phone.
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
Great. Well that changes a lot...
We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -
I didn't hit shit!
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
Fine...
Right behind you.
Fine -
Did you start out area six?
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
Well don't you think that's odd?
Gotta come from somewhere...
Where do you come from, Marvosa?
It's just...catching up with me, you know?
And who are you?
Yeah, it was opened -  with a goddamn screwdriver!!!
I'll live...
And what did he do to the girl?
Nothing!  He didn't do nothing!
He said he was following up some lead.
Well let's get his ass to the garage!  Some lead...
Yeah?
Up north.
Where up north?
Seattle.
You got any family?
You're the mysterious type, right?
Only on dates?
You'll find out - soon enough.
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
What exactly did you see?
What did you do then?
So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
Jim Trudell!  Bravo company!
No...I'm in some trouble...
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
Please...
Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
I killed them.
Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
OK...where do you want to start?
Let's see what we got...
And look at the balances...these aren't police salaries...
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
Shit, we just started.  But I better log out of this.
Tubbs, these people mean business.
I'm going to need a way to get there.
Mind if I come along for the ride?
Hop in.
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
Screw him!
Not with this...
Then what did you do, play canasta?
County jail - get in.
Where is he?
It was you who did the asking.
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
I wouldn't presume to try.
I don't recommend it.
Christ!
Twenty minutes max.
At the end is the tail of what could be an 'r.
Library of Congress.
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
Why not?
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
Last two like this we had, you caught.
I am all right.
These are all dead, Will.
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
You said the guy down here is good.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
What do you want to do?
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
...I'm going to see Lecktor.
To recover the mind set.
The mark? Yes.
Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
You.
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
We will feel sick for a very long time.
Wait, Will...
Get me a plane!
I'll pick you up in...
I won't be here.
When are you coming back?
When I'm done.
There has to be.
What?
Something Lecktor said.
What's that?
Don't talk to me!!
Have him peel the top label back.
See if there's another label underneath.
What?
Three minutes.
Stay in the trees.
Wait for the back-up! Will?
It's happening again, Jack...
He went to the men's room.
For Christ's sake get him!
They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
The activities of nocturnal animals.
When do you need it?
In eight days.
In the kitchen.
Yes, are you okay...?!
I'm fine.
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
Francis? Where are you?
The developing room.  I need to... see you.
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
Are you okay...?
I'll see you later. All right?
Yes.
Who?
Me.
Francis...?
Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
Was I in an accident?
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
I don't want to know.
Do you feel privileged?
I'm very scared.
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
No. I don't want to see you.
Yes.
Yes.
Do you see?
Please, no.
'No' what?
Not me.
Are you a man?
Yes.
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
No.
You will tell the truth?
Absolutely,
Dr. Chilton.
Yes?
Yeah. It's right here.
As long as it's on soft paper.  You may...  Find this curious.
Uh... sure...
Hi, Linda. ..
Linda doesn't come in nights.
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
Thank you very much.
No. I can help you.
I don't understand.
Atlanta and Birmingham.
Why do you think I called?
Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
He's right-handed.
Most people are.
He's misunderstood.
Cut the general crap.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
What happened to them?
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
I call him a monster.
I understand he cut you pretty good...
What about the dog?
He asked how you are.
And you said?
I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
Huh?  Will? Is that you?
Hey, baby! Where are you?
At the store. You doin' some good?
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
Tell me about yourself.
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
I have to see somebody.
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
Blue is cold.
Do you remember what you said?
Yes. I said this is too good to live...
You haven't smoked in two years.
I'd like one of your cigarettes, please.
Then why?
No.
And... where are things?
I have to go back to Birmingham.
Is Crawford going with you?
Will? Are you okay?
Will?  You could come up here.
You got a deal...
You going back down to Florida after?
Yes. Is Molly there?
Tell her I called.
Go on to the house.
Lt. Fisk said...
Go on to the house...
Are you George Sherman?
Yes. Who are you?
My name's Will Graham. I...
Oh, Jesus... Come in.  Honey...!
I can't thank you enough, I...
Yeah...
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
I figured I'd ask you...
Are you gonna kill him?
No.
She got all right?
...after a while.
And Hobbs died?
...yes.
I got it. Thank you.
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
Yes.
Why should I tell you?
Then how did you catch me, Will?
You had disadvantages.
What disadvantage?
You're insane.
You're very tan, Will.
Pictures?
Yes.
Do you dream much, Will?
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
Yes. I'd considered it.
I don't have one right now.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
I haven't decided yet.
I hope you have a second chance...
Let's walk the route.
Tank you veddy much.
No.  Caspiar.
"No"?  "No" to which part??
I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.
I refuse.
Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.
Hi George!
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
That's alright.  Where...?
What's up?
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
Oh, you know the Bay Area!  Always foggy!
Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
You've got good days and bad days.
Yeah...
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
Oh!
Ten.
Deal.
Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
Hi... am I late?
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
Hi... am I late?
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
No thanks.
I'm here, ain't I?
No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
It's me.
Oh, it's open.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
Andy... there is no real you.
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
Have you told your family?
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
Okay.  You're probably right.
Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  "Maui?  "Wowie!"
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
DON'T TOUCH ME!
Then your father's a wimp.
And you're just poor white trash!
Then your father's a wimp.
And you're just poor white trash!
What?!?
Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
So?  What do they know?
No!  Andy, don't do it --
They're asking for it.
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!
No!  NO NO NO!  None of that!  I want this show to be positive!
Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
Yes, your Holiness?
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
Positive.
It's probably just a strained muscle.
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
Er, yes.  Speaking.
"Speaking"!  Reeking, seeking, creaking... Freaking!
Kaufman's a lying bastard!  If you sign him, I'll RUIN YOU!
So your name's not Gorsky.
Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
I used to think you were original.
What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it!
There!
He said he's coming back!
They're gonna lynch him!
Why isn't he MOVING??
Bob.
"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
Yes.
SHUT UP!  I hate them Polish jokes!
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
He'll be contacting us again.
Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
Their next target.  The name is Neo.
It's already begun.
Know what?
Hurry!
And you are?
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
You all look the same to me.
Oh shit.
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
No way.  Not possible.
What?
Should Tank I.D. it?
Oh, God.
It's Choi.
I know.  It's her fault.
I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
You don't, do you?
Hear what?
Yeah, 'course I'm sure.
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
Cypher?  Where's Tank?
He had an accident.
An accident?!
No!
He's going to pop!
No, it's all right.
What are you doing?
Midnight watch.
The Matrix?  Yeah.
... Yeah.
What happened to them?
Dead.  All dead.
How?
Any time.
I need an exit!  Fast!
Cypher?
Just get me outta here.
Yes.
Goddamnit!
Go.
Shit!  Apoc?
We have no choice.
He's beginning to believe.
Five minutes.  Maybe six.
I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.
Stand up and see for yourself.
Right now?
Yes.  Now.
Yes.
But what if...?
How do you know all this?
Please.  Come.  Sit.
Why not?
Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
You've never used them before.
More important than what is when?
Wild, isn't it?
Your training.
You -- you're too fast.
Because... I didn't think I would?
Your mind makes it real.
The body cannot live without the mind.
Look again.
No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
What's going on?
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
Of the Resistance.
And she knows what?  Everything?
She would say she knows enough.
How does she know?
Yes.
What did she tell you?
That I would find the One.
Yes I do.
Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
I need the main wet-wall.
We need an exit.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
We're on our way --
Yes, sir.
Do it!
Shit, I'm sorry.
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
How do you know that name?
My name is Trinity.
Gee-zus.
What?
Most guys do.
No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.
They're watching you, Neo.
Who is?
It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
From what?
From you.
We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
It's going into replication.
Easy, Neo.  Easy.
That's different.
Are you worried?
Should I be?
No.
What did she tell you?
She told me...
... right as rain.
Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
What happened?  What did you see?
It might have been.  I'm not sure.
We can't leave him!
We have to!
I'm going in after him.
You can't!
I have to.
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
Because...
I'm coming with you.
No, you're not.
Do what?
Not yet.
No.
The Oracle.
They're hacking his mind.
How?
Neo, this has to be done!
Because I believe in something.
Kick it in!  Kick it in!
Tank, it's me.
You're not far from Cypher.
I'll be all right.
Dozer?
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
Trinity, we don't have any other choice.
What the hell just happened?
An Agent!  You have to send me back!
I don't know.  I lost him.
Hurry, Neo.
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Know where he is?
Follow me.
Nothing's private...
Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.  They don't have shit.
That means it's good.
You got sparklers?
You sure?
Well the guy over there said...
I gotta get the stuff.
Can't we come with you?
Uh...can we give you a check?
A check?  What the...hey, where you kids from?
Anybody wanna have a game?
'And with your spirit.'
Salute!!!
I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
Jewish...
How do you know?
She don't look Jewish.
Kennedy.
It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
Yeah.
No.
I'll say that I'm travelling.
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
Yeah, I'm gonna worry about you, too.
Not quite...but keep trying.
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
Giovanino!  Where have you been?
I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
Should I slap him?
What do you mean?
Didn't show up.
I could have told you that.
Cut it out stupid.  It's me.
Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
Did you see them run!
I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
Me?  I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie...
What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
I'll be here.  Don't worry.
Mind your own business.
He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Nope...
OK, get in.
Get him in.
Ok...that's it.
C'mon Johnny.
Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
$20.
He'll be here.  Look, take this for now.
Charlie, this is business.
Yeah, where's the rest?
I know.
Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
Ok.
Oh...around...why?
You heard what happened to GROPPI, eh?
Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...
Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
What was it?
Nothing.
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
"Francis Macomber."
Wha?
Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
Do you have enough?
Well...
I don't mind.
It's all right.
Maybe, who knows.
Charlie...?
Nobody knows anything, believe me.
Don't ask.
No.
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
You're intolerable today.
Watch your language.
Well you can't blame them in a way.
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
Girls?  You call those skanks girls?!
I feel fine--nothing wrong with me.
Count it.
Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
 Shut up.
Sal!... fourteen street.
Come on.
Yeah...just had it delivered...
Yeah, I think so.
I know...I know.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
Well...no.
You mean it's heisted.
You could say that.
This is a heisted car!
Friends of yours Michael.
Shut up.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Can you spare it?
Sure.
You think so?
Yeah, speak for yourself.
He's coming.
His wife?
Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
Love that name.
He's cute.
Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
Hi, Allison --
Have you got a minute?
But it's your birthday.
And you could care less --
We've got some things to discuss.
From the Korean War.
I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
Annie made them.
It's for the party, Dad --
'Goddam party'!
They respect you.  Isn't that a kind of love?
That you've been to Susan?
I wasn't going to say --
But what?
What will I tell Annie?
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
Red or white?
Both.
Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.
You mean this, sir?
Right away.
What 'business'?
You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
Yeah.  Goodnight.
So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?
Am I not obligated to?
Hello, Quince.
Here...
'Here'?
Why yes, thank you.
Hot or cold.
Cold.
And a glass.
"Death and Taxes"?
What an odd pairing.
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
Of whom?
It doesn't matter.
Then why did you bring it up?
-- And now you're going to pee some more.
In my sleep.
What'd it say?
'Yes'.
'Yes' to the deal?
Did you just hear something?
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
No no, not you.
It's going to be great --
Do you think I need a haircut?
Bill, after this deal, you'll be able to afford one.
You have a way with words.
Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh -- this is --
Yes.
What do you mean?
Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'
Uh -- he's from out of town --
Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
Glad I could be of some help.
'Just kidding'?
Sit down, Drew.
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
How nice for you both.
I thought this was practically a done deal --
Please, Drew.
Sure.
Yours.
I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
Don't you want to hear the details?
No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
You get not to go to jail.
'It's up to Joe', huh?
Yeah, that's what he said.
-- But he was concerned about the timing?
That's what he said.
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
But I didn't mean to do it!
He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
Yeah, the short, gray hairs.
Obeah evil.  I not evil.
What you then?
I from dat nex' place.
Some spot you pick.
Make it go 'way.
Doctor lady make it irey.
No, I come to see Doctor.
Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
My Doctor Lady?
Mine, too.
You loved back?
I am.
She knows you real self?
She knows how she feel.
Rass!
Don' need you okayin'.
Hi, Jennifer.
Nothing?
Good morning, Jennifer.
The Board is waiting.
What?
As long as it takes.
Hey, this is fun.
It's so very nice to see you again.
And you're a nice man, Quince.
Confused, huh?  About what?
Love.
You love Allison, don't you?
Oh yes, I do.
How did you meet?
Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
I'm lost.
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
I'm sorry.
Do you love Drew?
Come again?
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
I can see why.
Yes?
Goodnight to you, Susan.
Then why are you here, Joe?
I came to see you.
Watch me do what?
Whatever you do.
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
And I'll be a visitor.
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
I don't mind --
Be sorry for nothing.
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
Excuse me?
I mean I appreciate that.
And I appreciate you, too.
It comforts you, doesn't it?
Yes...I've found that it does.
Has her pain abated?
Girlfriend?
No.
Gay?
No.
To bed.
'To bed'?
Yes.  I'm tired.
I said get out.
-- I guess you haven't.
It was everything.
I am.
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
Yes, he's tired.  I believe so.
More than you love peanut butter?
For how long?
Oh, I hope a long, long time.
I love you in an evening gown.
We know all that we need to know --
But there's so much to tell you --
Don't.  That will come later.
Will it?
'Love will find out the way'.
'Love will find out the way'?
It's a saying.
I believe that, don't you?
Yes, that's why I said it.
I love you now, I'll love you always --
-- Yes?
Thank you for loving me.
Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
How long have I got?
You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
Not at all.
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Good night to you, Bill.
Good morning, Bill.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
It is a deal?
A 'deal'?
Yes?
You've got a deal.
Yes, Bill.
Make an exception?
There's one to every rule.
I'm not everybody.
That's what everybody says.
I understand.
What do you mean?
What's it like where I'm going?
Can you keep a secret?
Yes.
So can I.
Are you sad, Bill?
Oh.  Okay.
No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
Why didn't you stop me?
Well...I don't know.
This part I'm interested in.
Absolutely.
I don't know.
You were just curious?
I guess...
About Susan?
I wouldn't put it that way.
What way would you put it?
You tell me, Bill.
Goodnight.
That's okay.
Just a manner of speaking.
Then I can't help you.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm her father!
I told you, 'watch it'.
Yes?
Yeah.
Good.  Tomorrow, after the party.
Not at all.
I was just asking, Bill.
I think you heard me, Bill.
Well, they're mine now.
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
I don't expect you to.
Are you threatening me?
Get him in here.
It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's going to step aside --
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
-- An IRS man.
An offense --
An indictable offense.
Thank you.
I guess you have your reasons.
I am not a dream.
'...Yes --'
Death!
That's me.
You fill the bill, Bill.
I do?  How long will you be staying?
You should hope quite a while.
And then --?
Of course.
It just occurred to me --
Speak up, please.
I didn't ask any question.
I believe you did.
I don't!
What you were talking about.
I'm sorry, I --
It's enough now.
Please.  Talk to me --
I think you know --
Know what?  Know what, goddammit!
I'm here.
Time.
I'm sorry --
Yes, Bill.  The question.
Good morning, Quince.
How're you doing--?
I'm doing great.  You ready?
How's that, Quince?
Yeah.  Or the week after.
Yeah, I give a shit.
See.  There.  What'd I tell you?
The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
Sir, I'll deliver the package.
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
Hi, honey.
Drew told me.
I hope so.
You like him, don't you?
...Then don't.
You're only six-five once.
I am.  With you.
I know it's none of my business --
You mean like you loved Mom?
Uh oh --
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
What were you going to say?
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
Aw, you're tough.
Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning could strike.
He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
Nothing.
Yer damn right.
We've met.
What?!
Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
Will it?...
Yeah, it's good to get together.
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
It's something.
Joe?
I don't know.
I don't know, I can't say --
I'm having a helluva time.
Yes, but --
That's why it's okay.
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
The fireworks are about to start.
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
You and 'Honey'?
Nothing lasts.
I agree --
Why?
'Her'.
How 'bout another cup of coffee?
I've got patients coming in --
Did I say something wrong?
No, it was so right it scares me.
No --
Y'didn't?
But we've got time.
From what?
That's it.
I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
What can I do for you, Leonard?
I'm sorry... um... ?
Burt.
I have no memory.
Amnesia?
What's it like?
Couple days.
So you're holding my calls?
As requested.
Seen you together, that's all.
What?
No, let's go.
Then why is this my handwriting?
When was I in here?
You're still paying for it. It's still Your room.
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
That's right I did, didn't I?
Who did this to you?
You did.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
Thanks.
Interested in buying one?
Do you remember me?
Yeah, I remember you.
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
Take the money and walk away!
I don't want your fucking money!
Is that what your little note says?
Why?
It's isolated.
I wasn't helping you for money.
Don't remember.
Who is he? What have you got me into?
What?
Kill him.
Course not.
What happened?
Who did he go to meet?
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
I'll go see him.
My wife used to call me Lenny.
This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.
I told him about your car.
Why would you do that?
Somebody's come. Already.
Who?
Calls himself Dodd.
What does he want?
No!
What's this all about?
Don't protect him.
I'm not.
Help me.
How?
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
About your whore of a wife?
Thanks.
Sweet.
Dying.
What?
I remember my wife dying.
What do you want?
A BEER, please.
What are you here for?
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
Well, that's me.
Oh. But haven't we met before?
How do you know about me?
My boyfriend told me about you.
Who's your boyfriend?
Jimmy Grantz. Know him?
My name's Leonard.							 *
Did Teddy send you?
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
Then why are you here?
It's good.
You've read it a hundred times.
I enjoy it.
That's who you were, you don't know who you are.
I guess I've told you about my condition.
Mr Gammell?
Lenny, is that you?
John Gammell?
You said you were leaving town.
Things change.
Guess I've told you about my condition.
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
Probably left it in your room.
No! Should I?
I might have fallen asleep before I did.
No. No, just let me think for a minute.
Why?
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
I'll ride with him. You follow.
What's wrong with this one?
You like it? Let's trade.
Teddy. Your buddy.
Prove it.
She's involved with these drug dealers.
Why not?  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99

Wouldn't be appropriate.						*
That, and your thing.						   *
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
You exposed him for what he was: a fraud.
Are you sure?
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
Yes, I will.
No, you won't.
Somehow, I'll know!
You won't remember!
I thought so too! I was sure you'd				* remember. But you didn't.					    *
No. You took them out.						  *
Why would I do that?						    *
You can't just take it!
Lemon or lime?
You in Miami workin' on your complexion...?

Grieve elsewhere.
And...?
"And" what?

We're not certain!
Yes you do...
I got to talk to my ADO...
I got the item.
Two main players plus three.
My end?
25% discount on the load.
Make it 40%.
Make it 35.
Deal.
When?
Right now.
Okay.
Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."
I'm a fiend for mojitas.
It goes very fast.
Show me...?
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
Havana.
She's dead...
Later!  Do you dance?
I dance...
No.
I insist.
To mothers.  And all that we owe them...
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
...and therafore there is no consequence?
Cost less.  That's the point.
Is it December?
What do you mean?
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Zero risk.
Twenty-eight-point-five.
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
Hola, viejo.
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
In Kowloon, once, I got one that said, "Live now because life is dust."
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
Of course.
Where would I go?
A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites.
I know.  And now?
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
Hello, Miss Ukraine...
Something's wrong.
Transpo?  How they bringing the loads in...?
What happened to the last transporter you <u>had</u>?
Port-Au-Prince.
Five minutes...
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
Good.  So let's go...
Nothing.
On my way back...
Verdado.
Verdado where?
Havana, Cuba...?
We're makin' moves on each other.
Oh, that makes it okay, then.
So we want to change-up the mission statement.
Chill out Sonny.
As in...?
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
I am asking.  You to me.
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
What's the point?  It's going down.
Twenty on my man...
You're giving away your money, fool...
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
This is Agent James Fujima.
What's your Miami PD badge number?
Okay.  What's up?
"Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
We don't know.
To recruit you.
Sonny...?
Where's Riccardo?
On the phone.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...
Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
They had me from the gate.
I don't understand...
Goodbye.
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
White supremacist types.
They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
Yeah.
You sure?
Yes.  What's up?
What flowers?
What's it say?
"Salutations from the south..."
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
Not French registry?
You set this up!
Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like.  Maybe this does not work.
Do we need this...?
I had to lay eyes on you.
It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
Alonzo...
What...?
The Statue of Liberty.
Beg pardon, ma'am?
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
You sure you heard what I said?
Lotta rich women back there...
Yeah?
Men, they mostly faggots.
Must be some mess back there.
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
Yeah, oh yeah.
Sure you're all right?
I know. Scribbage!
Y -- what in hell starts with Y?
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
Same all around! For my friend, too!
For money.
For money for what?
I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?
Oh hell, forget it.
I mean, dammit, where you live?
It's sticky. What you do, slobber on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.
Okay, right, right, okay. Another subject. Where you living? Still at the hotel?
What's that supposed to mean?
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
Oh. Guess I got the wrong impression.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?  And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
Can he smell the difference, eh?
Don't need a comb.
Few dozen cooties won't kill me, don't guess.
Twenty bucks...
I'm scared.
What of?
They gotta be.
Yeah.
How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
Shee-it. You believe all you read?
I'm wet.
You're what?
Hell, don't cry about it!
What?
Get outta my way.
You're wasting your time. There's nothing in there.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
Ready for hard work, son?
Ready for anything.
Instant V-goddam-D.
No. You got it.
... and taxi fare for me.
History, man, history. How much?
Two kilos.
KNOCK IT OFF!
What?
Listen!
You want to split your hernia again?
How's your hernia?
Don't make me laugh.
Nah, just covered with batshit!
Ziat!
Billy?
Everything.
Don't worry about it.  Right now money doesn't count. Okay?
Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.
How do you like it?  Istanbul?
For the money... )
Oh Jesus! 
Sure.
How far?
About ten kilometers.
Sixty Lira?
Sixty?
How much?
Yes.  I think so.
Just what?
Something like that. Cigarette?
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
How much did you figure to make?
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
What's your father do?
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
Be tough on 'em.
...She was on the plane.
Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
About as good as it looks.
What did he do?
Twelve years.
A hundred grams.
Seven years...
What's that?
I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
Yeah.
Yeah!
Jimmy?
Two thirty.
What?  You gotta be joking.
After we're outside the kogus?
Oh we... we...
Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire...
Cut his fucking throat.
Whose?
I want to cut his throat.
It's already been cut.
Then I'll cut his balls off.
What?
Max - where?
Maybe he's changing jobs.
You can't take anything seriously.
You're right.
My passport!
No!
Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
You're ayip!
You 'Merican.  You don't know.
Work, work, work, that's all do
I don't hear you bitch about the money.
Mr. Yesil.
Who?
The lawyer?
Who got the Frenchman out?
What's your name?
Jeremy...
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
Tell them to send flowers to the usual address.
Yeah...?
There's some weird shit here.
Weird shit...?
Take a look.
And a right.
Right.
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-
You got a better way up?
Oh, man, there you go again.
Just do it!
Oh, Jesus!!
"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
The kid's with them!!
What do you-?
Go!! Just go!!
Hurry, the woman needs help!
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
What?
Across both tracks!!
This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?
You did!
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
You know what I mean...
Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
Don't you get it? It's more than that.
Maybe they lied to you.
So?
No, there's...
Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!
No such thing, baby.
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
Toss the flare down!
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's not like them!
What-
Just do it!!
It worked before...
The scent won't last...
That's why we should do it now.
Jump in.
Your arm, you can't...
I can.  We can do this...
Ah...
Talk to me.
Peter...
We can do it!
You the bug lady, right?
Gross. What is it?
No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
She used a baster.
No shit.
Fuck! It broke the skin...
What?
I know.  Help me get a sample.
Anything you can tell me might help.
It's right this way.
I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way...
How long...?
What are they...?
They're called Novril--they're for your pain. 
If you wouldn't mind.
I don't have a title yet.
What's it about?
Nothing.
No, what is it?
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
The profanity bothers you?
It has no nobility.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
My pleasure.
I know how that can be.
Done?
Yeah, thanks.
No problem.
Then who did?
Yes.
So you've indicated. Do it.
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
It'll only take a second.
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
You can--you have the "gotta"--
The what?
What?
Nothing.
Not even a hint?
Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.
It looks wonderful. And so do you.
Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
You really think so?
The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
No, I haven't.
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
That's disgusting.
Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
Paul, this will be our legacy.
It will.
You don't know?
I'm almost done.
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
Four or five days ago. Why?
Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff.
What? What is it?
They're hauling Misery into court.
That's nice.
Oh, I like that tone.
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
It's good you found it.
There's that spice again.
He's your client, huh?
Yes, he is.
Buster.
Answer me a couple things?
If I can.
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
No, the typing kind.
Oh. That kind. Nothing odd about that.
Yeah. They're in the semis.
Here it is.  Very first copy.
I am. Well, maybe not completely--
From her point of view or mine?
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
Well that depends.
How do you that.
Magic...
Mmmm.
Oh, I am.  Later..
What else?
Well, that's good, isn't?
Sort it all out.
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again.
An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i>
Where?
And you're happy about that?
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
In other words, you're calling her a flake.
More like two-two point two million.
In any case we don't want your cash.
It's okay.  She scrambled the transmission.  Luther, continue feeding the GPS her position.
Then we got'em!
..in the building...
Not for seven more minutes.
I hope there's a place to land.
We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
And the check's in the mall.
He's heading down the stairs, now..
How much longer before you can reach him?
Five and a half minutes.  He's breached the hot zone..
No.  Should I?
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh?
I see.  You're not just another pretty face..
- torque wrench.
Do what?
Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
Your help?  What are you talking about?
Ethan Hunt.
Care to wait a decent interval?
Who wants to be decent?..
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
They've got a book for this?
They've got a book for everything.
That they're lying.
I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes.
Damn, you're beautiful.
Five, six-hundred thousand.
And six billion in the world.
I'd like a little more conviction..
So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Can you think of a better one?
Then feel better!..
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
Just like old times.
Just like old times?
Just about..
Affirmative.
Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
Oh Ethan!..
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
Why did you phrase it like that?
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
You gotta be kidding.
Like?
Then you do think it was Ambrose.
Excuse me?
Very.
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
No.  I can't afford to be curious.  And neither can you, Hunt..
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
..not in time to save him.
You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.
I'm fine..
Why not?
Yep.
Roger that.
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
Copy.  She's only got twenty-eight minutes left.  Track ahead and pick her up.
Good job.  And thanks.
What's happening here?  You're dead!
Do I?
Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev...
Yes, Anatoly, yes.
S.O.P..
Hes putting on a show, Barnes.
What kind of show.
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
Fold it.  Fold it tight.
May take a little time.
We got it.  On your feet.
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
I'm walking.
Talking's good, walking's better.
Sleeping's better.
No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
There was nobody on the bridge.
What happened to Jim?
Take off your coat.
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Who is they, who is they?
I'm going to answer it.
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
Sure...
I didn't say that.
You didn't have to.........
What about you?
I'm going to try and get some sleep.
Bastard!
Is this the only way?
Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
This stuff is so sticky.
Claire.
Go secure.
Theyre dead.
Whos dead?
Dont <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
One hour.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
Yes.  I see your point.
Why was there another team?
What?
I don't quite follow you.
Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.
Certainly Ethan.
Information.
What kind?
Profitable.
You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- <u>with</u> the artificial intelligence Risk chip --
Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
Now I want you to hold onto it.
About what?
Why don't you come back with me?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
I need one hundred thousand dollars.
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
On what?
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
Why, may I ask?
That's the question I want to ask Job.
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
It doesnt, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
Do you <u>want</u> to blow the fire through the whole building?
IMF mainframe.
Where exactly is it?
In Langley.
Time up.
We're not outta here yet.
My contact is extremely shy.
What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
Always.
Just don't chew it.
I didn't touch it.
Give me a break, Pops.
Stairway, youre wrapped, go to transport.
Higher.
Right, right.  Good.
What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
Jim.  Jim.  Hes in the open.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
Very well.
I'd say you've got about two minutes.
Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
He's our guy.
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
Can you lose him?
No.  Abort.
<u>Negative</u>, Golitsyns on the move.
About two hundred yards from the bridge.
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
I remember..
How did Kittridge do it?..
Whats going to make him do that?
What he didnt get in Prague.  The NOC list.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
I usually am.
And get a doctor.
Good luck.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Why don't you take a look?
Jack...that's spying.
That's what we do isn't it?
Jack you're so wicked.
Too wicked to have a drink later?
I think I might just take that look.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
This wasnt what we discussed.
Connection denied.
Try it again.
Its not working.
Run it through from the top.
Phew!  Weve got five minutes...
No, I'm going.
The Shawfish?
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
And I'll have the special fish.
I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
Again? Johnny Cammareri.
You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo.
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
Rita. Pass the wine.
Why you drinking so much?
You're welcome.
I'm going to bed now.
His brother.
And go to confession.
No. You were there.
Hello, Mr. Castorini.
And that's how much I'm saying.
Bed.
You're not sleepy?
Ti amo.
You look tired.
What's your news?
I'm getting married.
Yeah.
He got hit by a bus.
I won't come.
I didn't give you away the first time.
Yeah.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
Let's go tell your Mother.
I got it done.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Who is this man? You're engaged!
You're married.
Alright. I didn't see you here.
I don't know whether I saw you or not.
I like your dress.  It's very bright.
I don't know. I got a feeling.
Good morning, Lucy.
You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.
He's in Palermo.
What's wrong can never be made right. 
Let me come and talk to you.
Why?
I'm going to marry him.
You are going to marry my brother?
I have no life.
Excuse me.
Maybe I should come back another time.
But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
I'm making you a steak.
I know that. I do what I want.
You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
Where'd Johnny find you?
He knew my husband who died.
How'd he die?
Bus hit him.
Fast.
Instantaneous.
When you get engaged?
Why what?
Stupid.
How many men since then?
Just Johnny.
Stupid yourself.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
Yes.
I'm telling you your life!
Stop it!
No!
Because I have no Luck!
Where are you taking me?
To the bed.
Me neither.
I was dead.
Get all of me. Take everything.
What about Johnny?
That light.
I've never seen a moon like that.
It makes you look like an angel.
What?
Take it easy.
I'm marrying your brother!
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
You don't get along with anybody!
What did I do?
You ruined my life.
I'm in love with you!
I can't!
I'm telling you you can't.
But he wants me to come!
But that's cause he don't know!
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
Alright. Where's the Met?
Hi.
You look beautiful. Your hair...
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
Kinda gaudy.
For what?
Come on.
It's the best thing there is.
Awful?
Yeah.
I think that's it.
I wanna go home.
How can you ask me that?
You're making me feel guilty again.
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
I know what I know.
You're late!
We're here.
That's right.
This is where we're going!
Yeah.
I'm really afraid.
Why?
I was.
And you're not now?
No.
Let me go home.
No.
I'm freezing to death.
Is Johnny here?
He's coming.
No. I'm gonna wait.
Ronny, please...
Loretta, what are you talking about?
I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me!
What!
Will you marry me.
Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri!
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Yeah, I'll be in.
Hi.
Johnny.
No?
Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too.
She was too young for him.
Never is a long time.
I shouldn't.
Will you marry me?
What?
Will you marry me?
Yes, on the floor.
This is a good suit.
Seven-thirty.
A week. Two weeks. No more.
How about a month from today?
A month from today?
Yeah.
You've made me very happy, Johnny.
He's my younger brother.
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
WHAT?
I must ask for that back.
Where's the ring?
No.
Why not?
Pop don't like Johnny.
I got married before, you didn't sell.
And we'll sell the house.
Where you been?
Cosmo's cheating on me.
What! How do you know?
A wife knows.
Well. I don't really know where to start.
Everything's different.
No. Are you drunk?
No. But I have a hangover.
No more he's not.
He's with his dying mother!
She recovered.
WHAT!! She was dying!
It was a miracle.
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Oh God, that's too bad.
What's the matter with him?
Did you see it?
No.
Oh.
That's a pretty big sin.
I know.
You should think about this.
I don't know.
Did you see the moon last night?
I came right from the airport.
Come on in.
Where is she?
Yes.
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
My mother's recovered.
You're kidding?
Yes.
I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
I don't know.
You don't know where Loretta is?
No idea.
Johnny...
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
Of course I want to.
It was a miracle!
Do you have a girlfriend?
It's nothing!
I'm not disturbed. By you.
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
She was just too young for you.
Will you join me for dinner?
Are you sure?
That woman was a student of yours?
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
Don't shit where you eat.
I'm a housewife.
Then why are you eating alone?
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
Why do men chase women?
Nerves.
Yes.
Yes.
People home.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
Good night.
You mean the whole house?
Yes.
My God, it's a mansion!
It's a house.
Look.
Oh.
It's Cosmo's moon.
Cosmo.
I don't know.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
I don't know! That moon! That crazy moon Cosmo sent over!
You see that moon last night?
I knew she had it.
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
Did you dress her up like this?
Does wood sink in water?
Bread?  No, no, no.  Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...
You're using coconuts!
Through ... We found them.
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
What do you mean?
Well, this is a temperate zone.
Not at all.  They could be carried.
What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
Am I right?
I'm not interested.
He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
The Britons.
Who are the Britons?
All of us are ... we are all Britons.
We don't have a lord.
What?
I am your king!
Well, I didn't vote for you.
You don't vote for kings.
Well, how did you become king, then?
Who are they?
Oh!
NI!   NI!
Oh!
We want ... a shrubbery!
A what?
Ni!  Ni!  Ni ... Peng ... Nee ... Wum!
You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
Of course.
And not too expensive.
Yes ...
Now - go!
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
No, no ... not "is"!
What?
So be it!
'Tis but a scratch.
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
No, it isn't.
Well, what's that then?
I've had worse.
You're a liar.
What?
Look!
What!  Just a flesh wound. 
Stop that.
I'll have your leg.
Come Here.
You're a looney.
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
Well, what are you then?
My liege ... forgive me ...
Bedevere, my Liege.
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
That's it.  Ni!  Ni!
No.  No.  No!
Just keep me covered.
What does it say?
Yes, my liege.  Stand by for attack!!
Oh, just some friends!
There are some who call me Tim?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
Greetings King Arthur.
You know my name?
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
A Grail?
Yes, I can help you with your guest.
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
What?
There he is!
There.
Behind the rabbit?
It is the rabbit.
... You silly sod.
What?
I warned you!
Man!
What?
:Well - I can't just say:  "Hey, Man!'
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
You didn't bother to find out, did you?
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
Yes, I see.
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.
Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
Course it's a good idea.
The nose?
Why do you think she is a witch?
I'm not dead!
Do me a favour.
What is your quest?
To find the Holy Grail.
What is your favorite colour?
Right.  Off you go.
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
What is your quest?
What is the capital of Assyria?
Here's one!
Yes he is.
I can't take him.
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
Thursday.
That's all right.  See you on Thursday.
I dunno, Must be a king.
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
Farewell, Concorde!
They cost fifty pounds each!
Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
Father, lad.
I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
Listen, Alice ...
Herbert.
I'm ... your son ...
Not you.
I was saved at the last minute.
Well ... I'll tell you ...
Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
Leaving the room ... yes.
Yes?
If we ... er ... 
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
Until you, or anyone else ...
No, not anyone else - just me.
Just you ...
And make sure he doesn't leave.
Make sure he doesn't leave.
The Prince ... ?
We're coming with you.
What is your name, handsome knight?
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.
Camelot ...
You are in great peril.
We'll cover your escape!
Look - I'm fine!
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
... I Bet you're gay.
No, I'm not.
Ector.
We must examine you.
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
Back to your bed!  At once!
I'm sorry, I must go.
Well ... yes ...
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
He's come to rescue me, father.
Well, let's not jump to conclusions ...
Don't say that word.
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
You've said it!  Aaaaarghhh! ... We've said it ... Wwe're all saying it.
That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!
Look.  I'm warning you.
What's he do?  Nibble your bum?
Shut up.
Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
I didn't.
Bravely ran away, away.
No, no, no.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
I speak as I find, Archie.
Not down south you don't.
I think he nearly ruptured his truss.
Seventy a year.
Not bad, not bad.
How about yourself?
Sixty.
It's only grief makes her like she is.
Come on, man.  There's love and there's ...
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
The good-looking one.
Aye, but will they?
John, it's not your problem what she eats.
She'll think it's her fault for keeping me.
I'm getting dressed.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
I've got my duties to attend to.
She'll get over it.
I can't let her down now, Archie.
She means it.
It's a diary.
What do you take me for?
I can't move to tidy.
It's what the maids are for.
Mary Taylor, sir.
I hope to go up next year.
Kitchen and lower house.
It's cold out there tonight, Barney.
Good man.  And is she all right?
Are you all right, Barney?
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
I beg your pardon?  Mama...?
She's busy.
Convey her a message.
Do you know who you address, sir?
Whom you address.
The future King!
Out of my way!
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
It's so infernally cold in here.
Cold is good--  Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
It is quite late enough.
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
You'll talk when I'm finished!
Back and upper corridors.
I'm sorry?
You'll be sent a message.
Who'll bring it to me?
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
In matters concerning the Household, I act on her behalf.
Yes.  I do.
I beg your pardon?
Is that the Queen's request?
Yes, it most certainly is!
That can wait till the weekend.
There are important papers from --
It can wait.  Anything else?
I am a blank sheet.
Do you hunt?
Occasionally.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
If you hunt, you kill.
You're injured.
It's nothing.
Oh.
This is the top.
Surely --
Was there never ambition?
Then I envy yo.
Why?
For Her Majesty.
Aye.
I said.  I serve the Queen.
No other aspiration?
She trusts you, John.
See what?
They aren't as watchful as you.
Too busy looking after themselves.
The greasy pole.
No loyalty.
No love.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
In time, she will.
She'll think I betrayed her.
Ma'am.
You are here safely.
Aye, ma'am.
You are well?
I am.
And the pony?
She's well, too.
I'm glad of it.
Yes, ma'am.
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
He thought so, yes.
Yes.
What?
Those, over there, there.
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
Are they worth reading?
I am told so.
Who by?
What does he know about the Highlands?
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
That doesn't make him an expert.
Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
Of course I shall say what I have to say.  I always do.
To keep out the cold.
Aye.
I heard something.
I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
Yes, ma'am?
Has someone seen to those bruises?
Yes, ma'am.
Yes?
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
Because I have to! 
Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
I came as quickly as I could.
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
Oh, several things.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
Is that not enough?
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
Well, both.
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
To know when he'll be king.
Mrs Brown.
What's her excuse this time?
Excellent!
Not too protracted, I hope.
Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
Cold is good!
I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
Yes, ma'am.
What is he doing there?
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
Has he been hurt?
A few days, ma'am.
Why was I not told earlier?
And now I am back.
Again?
Read it!
I have no idea.
Why not?
What is it?
I have a letter, ma'am.
From whom?
My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
Why is he not here?
He is sick, ma'am.
Then why are you not with him?
He has typhoid fever, ma'am.
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.
Yeah, who isn't.
Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
How'd you know it was us?
You don't like it?
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
Why don't we take this into my office.
What the hell does that mean?
Did you play ARCADE last night?
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
Hey, kid.
We are talking...
No, in person.  Now.
It's twelve-thirty!
I'm in the middle of it...
Turn if off!
Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
What?!
We can't...
My house.  I want to try something.
What?
Right.  And then communication satellites, and then anywhere.
The Police, then...
I don't know.
What?
And beat it at it's own game.
Drives 'em crazy every time.
I can't believe you made it!
Everything.
You didn't hear me?
Yes I am...
I know.  It sucks.
We're actually inside, aren't we?
One.  In case...
Don't even say it.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
You've got the schematics, check.
Right, then...
Check your read-out.
What?!  There's nothing here!
Look around...
Screamer.
We don't have a choice!
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
I don't want to talk about it.
There never is.
So tell me you're okay, then.
I'm okay.
Sure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever.
Hold my keys, then.
Well, it's a long story...
Thought so.
Then we'll go home.
In this world, wrong is right!
Oh God...oh god...
Is that your question?
Wait!  No!  That's not it!
You have no time.
Of course I am.
But I don't understand...
The game will guide you.
Sign me up.
Fucked up.  That's what they said I was.
I am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take you?
Give her a chance, will you?
What's going on, Cynthia?
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
What did you say?
They fired everyone.
Who fired everyone?
I know.  Where are you Adam?
You're broke!
But I'm not broke.
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
It's been a very strange day.
Will you meet with him?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
Git along little dowgie and call me back.
There is no problem.
I'll speak to someone.
Howdy to you.
Yeah.
What did I say?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
You're an understandin' fella.
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
I told ya.
Wow!
You got it! See you later honey.
I was afraid of that.
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
Good luck, honey!
Are you okay?
Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
Yes.
Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
Can you tell me what happened?
Was anyone hurt?
May I have your name please?
Diane?
Number 17.
But it said #12.
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
Oh...
But, this could be serious.
No...I need to sleep.
If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
I don't know who I am.
What do you mean? You're Rita.
You don't remember anything else?
Mulholland Drive?
We'll take our check.
Maybe it's not me.
Call the number.
I'm not sure about this.
"Then they'd put you in jail."
Those men in front, in the car.
Do you know them?!
No... but...
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
And who are we auditioning for today?
My next delivery is up that way, so I'll be getting down to it real soon.
Okay. Why this Denny's?
Go ahead.
You see what I mean...
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
Yeah.
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
That's what I'm thinkin'.
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
Palmdale.
Damn, that's a long drive.
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
Hardly.
Not a coke or anything?
Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
No...
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
Jesus, my legs are asleep. I'll never be able to win this shit.
Yeah, I'd say that's it.
I have an embezzler and his accomplice.
Please don't be alarmed, Ma'am.
No time. Get him up.
Leave him, he's dead.
No !
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
I don't know.
We wait. This is an elevator.
We have to climb up that.
Give me a fucking.....
I'm working on it.
It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
I'm leaving.
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
Why would he ? His parents are rich.
We drown.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
Excuse me ?
Is this really the time ?
Do you have something better to talk about ?
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
Fine...
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
You don't. It's random, there no trick.
The Brooklyn Bridge.
Girder, watch your head.
I work here, remember ?
That was eleven years ago.
Yeah a real shame.
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
Just shut the fuck up.
I don't help criminals.
Not quite....
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
A dragon.
Are you hunting wabbits ?
You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
Look pipsqueak, I'm having a real bad day here and we're just starting.
What the fuck are you talking about.
Swimming, you know, like in water, moron.
Ow...
Thanks...
Don't have to tell me twice.
Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
Don't eat at the console.
What ? Are you my mother ?
But, he's...
I said NO.
Got it.
When will that be ?
When you are ready.
He probably has a history of this shit.
I'm sick of playing. I've got a better idea.
For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
Fire the whole division.
Excuse me, sir ?
I am thirty two.
And how much do we pay you annually ?
I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.
Sir ?
Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
No. I am not a homosexual.
Then what do you want ?
No I am not.
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
Bruce has just awaken.
What ?????
We can't afford too many surprises.
Yes. I think he's feeling sick or something.
I can see that but where ?
What happened ?
How can this happen ?
Yeah, right. He's stuck all the way over here
Really ? On a date ?
Yes.
Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
Hi. I brought some wine.
Thank you, won't you come in ?
Yes, Excuse me for a second.
No ! Just get up. This is serious.
What the hell kind of cop are you ?
I just need to sit and think for a second.
Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
We just having our first date when you showed up.
Nothing.
Zach from work ?
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
Where are we ?
Who was that guy anyway ?
Hey buddy. You okay ?
I'm going to go ahead and go now.
Good morning.
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
Are you writing a poem?
Oh, just put it over there.
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
Your Uncle Phil told me.
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
This is California, anything is possible.
Don't mention it.
I don't even know your name.
I would do it again in a minute.
What about living in the real world pal?
Could you hold on for a second? 
Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch.
Okay thanks, atta girl.
Well you know what I mean.
So, what's on your mind?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you Vada.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
It's just a question, it's not about anybody.
Her favorite poet.
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
What??
Thanks, I needed that.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Have fun.
Hi Dad.
Hi honey.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
Totally groovy huh?
Totally.
I love you too sweetie, bye.
She just had a baby that's all.
We have a baby?
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Well you should at least try a little bit.
How about a nice glass of milk?
And some taco chips so I can dunk.
You're being narrow-minded.
I was pushing as fast as I could.
Maybe he's hungry.
Oh.  Ohhh?
What're you saying?
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
Maggie...Maggie's little girl.
You mean, you knew about me?
I'd like to, thanks.
You are?
Yeah, come on, let's talk.
I've got something better.
More than anything in the world.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
Come on in!
It's just a corpse.
I know that.
Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
See you? He can smell you from there.
Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
He likes you.
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
Well if it isn't Vada, the grasshopper girl.
No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
Hi.
Then I have come to the right place.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
Rose.
It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
Happy hunting.
Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
Your mother?
I never met my mother.
Give it back Nicholas!
But we made a business deal.
What ever happened to a good old-fashioned favor huh?
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
There's water in your bathroom.
I want juice!
Don't wake up Vada.
You're over reacting!
No THANKS!
He said it was a gift.
Yeah, RIGHT.
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
WHAT??
Change my name.
Why do you argue with everything I say?
Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
You would.
May I use the phone please.
He is one of the great poets.
At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
Does it work?
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
I want it back now. I never should have taken it off, I want it back.
Give it to me!
Come and get it.
Just give it to me!!
Just come and get it...right here!
DON'T, come on!!!
Uh oh...
In the tar??
Owh...
Leave me alone!!
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
Here's Judy Garland!
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
What do you think?
Really?
This is a totally barbaric custom.
Yeah I guess...sort of.
But we wouldn't really be related right?
I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
Yeah?
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
Part adventure...part miracle.

Good-bye, look in your backpack.
Ten bucks.
What's it for?
For the mini-bike fund.
Wow!
You're a good man Nicholas.
Was Rose.
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?
Rose this not the place to be having this...
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
Uh huh, well...good to know. Phil hands Nick a               5 note
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
Committed.
Bye.
Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.
This is it I guess.
I should do this myself.
Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
You know where the fire extinguisher is.
No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
You know how I feel about you.
Yeah...right, it's pointless to worry.
Bye Niece, Vada.
Nothing, nothing at all.
I mean...with your car.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Well maybe for you.
Something wrong?
Well, even without anesthesia I always tell my patients to...eh... to relax.
Sort of?
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
I bet your mom sang to you.
Is there milk in them already?
When did you umm, I mean umm...
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
I'm definitely traveling some day.
What do you mean?
It would be fantastic.
But Dad'll never go for it.
You leave your father to me.
Hey! Oh look.
He's so tiny.
I know, look at his little hands.
You have no idea.
O.K.
He's a great poet.
He is?
Do you know him?
Vada!!
Good for you baby.
Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
All right, here.
WHAT?
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
Oh really, okay fine look, go cook,  Gimme the goddam keys.
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
You told everybody where you were going, I'm here for the motor home.
What?
The boss is watching us...
I'm impressed.
Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
No.
It's there.
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
The bee stings! I can't breathe!
I think it's still available.
Yes they are.
Stiffs??
Deceased.
I need the job.
Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
Well the other night at dinner...
Oh that, she just likes to play.
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
No kidding?
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
No. Just, more activity.
Oh, how do you mean?
I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
It's nice.
Are you mad at me?
No, why?
Here?
This is where we are.
Is there enough room?
In ages, I know, me neither.
Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.
Want to what?
Kiss me.
Yes.
Good.
Goodnight Shelly.
Goodnight.
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
I'm looking forward to that.
Okay.
Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
Is it really your camper?
Did you ahh, love him?
I would never marry anybody I didn't love.
Ya, that rack holds six ties.
Dad?
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
Is it for a child?
Then who's it for?
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Any more soda left?
I love this guy! 
Dad??
What?
The money?
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
You never cared before.
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
Can I go too?
No, sweetie, not yet.
Soon honey, soon.
Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!
Hi.
What are you doing.
Feeding my fish.
I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
Why not?
He was allergic to bees.
He's okay isn't he?
There were just too many of 'em.
What??
What was my mama like?
I'm very nervous.
Why?
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
Hi, is Vada home?
Thank you. Bye.
Bye.
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about you Thomas J?
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
This is one big house for one single person.
Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
Thirty five dollars.
What do you get for that?
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
For this class?
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
I wrote a poem too.
Please.
Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
Oh yes, yes.
Do you think she is?
No.
Does he love her?
Probably.
Do you like her?
Oh.
I am.
Chocolate?
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
My ball, I lost my ball.
Come on sweetie.
Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
Thomas?
Uh huh.
No, I'm divorced.
Can I use your bathroom first?
No.
A girl's always gotta look her best.
No.
Come here, sit down.
Uh huh, why?
See food!
Oh great!!
Yes!!
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
I'm hemorrhaging.
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I don't want, I don't need your help....
I'm eleven and a half.
Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
Goodnight.
I'm allergic to it.
To chocolate?
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
They're just fun to read.
What are you saving for?
Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
I can't, I have to go home.
Oh wow, a real evil canieval.
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!
Hurry!
I'm trying.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Naah, I don't wanna.
You could pick that scab on your arm.
It'll bleed.
Okay, OW!
No.
What's wrong with your eyes?
A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
Come on, it's fun.
What?
You have no personality.
Never mind.
Who's that with your Dad?
It's my mother.
Do you remember her?
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
What do you think it's like?
Heaven.
Don't DO that!!
Sorry.
I told you i'll get in trouble.
I am not.
Bed wetter!
I stopped that!
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
Go???
What?
Stand back.
You're right, let's knock it down.
What do you want it for anyway?
For their meat.
Hurry!!!
But I have my clothes on!
Do it!
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
I don't like her.
I do, she's real funny.
He likes her better than me.
Then go home, baby.
Leave then, some friend you are.
No, I'm hiding out.
Okay, seeya.
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Like they do on TV?
Uh huh.
Here, practice on your arm like this.
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
Close your eyes.
Okay, okay.
Okay on the count of three.
Umm, Ummmmm
Just, hurry.
Well, let's spit on it.
Okay.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
What?
Would you think of me?
For what?
Well, then, I'll take it up with her.
You should look like you dressed yourself.
I honestly wish I could...
Part of being a New Yorker.
If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.
Plus some guys whose food I don't like.
... I don't send you men, anymore. You don't know what to do with them.
Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
Desperate.  To talk.
We're about to find out.
I have a suggestion...
It's called the Law of Love, asshole.
I can see why.
When I'm talking to children.
Go figure you.
You've been working on this, huh?
Sure.
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
Neosporin?
Try less appropriate.
Ben Gay.
That was Thursday.
I can't even say it.
It's too late to start over.
Major.  Dish.
Manicure...
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
To belong to someone.
Oh, you're more than okay.
See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.
Uh.  How about promoting a bridesmaid?  Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
... you hate weddings, you never go.
... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?
But he sure can kiss.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
Let me rephrase that...
I was gonna predict that.
You win.
Ju...
... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
I just think you're wrong, is all.
Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
... whatever is manly and independent.
Exactly what?
Only.  If he wants to.
He won't get mad, huh?
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
What with the psychosis and all, yeah.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
Have you ever heard of. Irony?
Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey.  Prob'ly with Michael, doin' the nasty.
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
It doesn't say th...
You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!
Well, somet...
I need you.
W...
She's too genuine.
Hate that.
My very point.  Here's another one...
Quite the little eccentric.
She finds him "personable."
First girl I ever knew.  Who lets me give her a bath.
Firenze.
Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
That would be a girl.  I don't even know.
I never eat when I'm serene.
You never eat when you're despondent.
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
You keep saying that.
Well, you've got the rest of your lives.
No.  I've got you.
If you like.
You've been the man in mine.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
The night we met.
We danced to it.  Just like this.
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
That's my point!!
It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves.
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
It means a lot.
"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
It's over.
I just want to be alone.  Is that okay?
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
And your point?
Well.  How come she didn't...
She admits it's her fault.
Oh, yeah.
... yeah, that.
Shhh.
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
Lower.
I came here, looking for her.
This is where I proposed.
It's two weeks.
Almost three.
That is so romantic.
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
The most important thing. Is being together.
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
You're much more his type.
Right here.
Well, it better not happen again.
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
Grand Old Opera --
I hate that music.
I know that, Star.
Hi! Star.
Come on.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
No.
Don't feel that way, honey.
Then why are you listening to her -
What?
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
You're so good.
How did you come in here?
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
You remember what I said about the Vitamins.
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
I got them right here.
Okay. Thanks.
She's fine.
Well, you did and she's fine. Thanks.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
His Word.
Your job, huh.
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
Have you talked to Triplette?
Who the hell is he?
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
Who the hell is he?
He's going to run for president.
Third party?
What does he want?
Barbara Jean.
What!
That's what he wants.
You know better than that.
It's on National television, Barnett.
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
Okay, then we'll see you there.
Hi. Come on in. Mary!
Don't you worry. We're just having a quiet Sunday at home.
Hal Phillip Walker.
President.
ABC.
Minimum.
D.C.
Okay.
Stop it!
When is it?
How come?
Sue was trying to get hold of you.
To the bathroom.
It's the den mother.
Yes. Percy Warner Park'.
What crook?
Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
I'll just be in here.
What is a turkey shoot.
Some guy was drunk and hit him. Accident. Haven almost killed him.
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Haven's not going to talk to me.
Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
Hi, Sherry.
How'd you get in here.
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
Didn't you get?... How are you?
I'm fine. Can I go up?
Can I help you?
Yes, sir. I need a room
I think we can do that. Come in.
A little. What do you need?
Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
I'1l get your bag.
Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
That Tom sure is cute.
Replacement party.
Who's that?
Well, he's really amazing.
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
She had on high heels?
Need a ride?
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
You in music?
No.
Get in.
Oh, well, thanks. Ah, oh, maybe you know where...
Do you carry door handles?
What kind?
Nash.
What year?
Sixty-three.
Oh... Well.
The car broke down.
I feel really good.
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
Bet the sheets are grey.
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
I don't think so.
How do you know if they do?
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
Bye.
When I was little, in church.
Well, can you tell me why?
It just is.
About three years.
And before?
No, I don't.
He's a member of our congregation.
Linnea?
Yes. Who's this?
I'm here.
Who is this?
Tom. You remember?
I'm not sure. Where?
Oh, Tom, of course. What are you doing in Nashville?
Hi.
Who is this?  It's Tom.
I don't know who you are.
Wow!
What?
I've got a gig tonight.
Oh?
Doesn't it have a name?
Wrong.
I know.
Car pool?
I'm not sure.
I knew when I first met you.
Older.
Well...
I'm twenty-eight
Oh.
Older than thirty?
That's what you said before.
I know. Goodbye.
Premeditated murder.
Oh.
I see.
I'm sorry but I have to go.
Linnea?
Yes.
It's me. What is it?
Eight-thirty in the chapel.
I'll be there.
How much?
Glad to meet you.
He's pretty well known down here.
Yes.
You're real favorites of his.
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
Might be good for you.
You're not.
Where's Bill?
Sleeping.
Where are you going?
Out.
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Probably a little too long.
Do you study at all?
Depends on what I'm studying.
Just a minute.
Hello.
I'm Opal.
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
Why?
What?
What? Oh. A film.
Where is she?
No, we never did that
Southern California.
You always live there?
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
Peter Finch -- he's English.
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
I'll be dammed.
You bet.
It's not bad.
You think I should take lessons?
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
Sure thing.
May I see your costume?
More or less...
What was the color of Tim's belt?
The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
Which do you recommend?
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
When ya had it, did ya like it?
You got something you want to do?
Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.
Don't stop!
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
You been followin' the news coverage?
You've heard of it?
So, how do I fit into this scheme?
I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.
What?
You're taking us to that holding cell now.  All right, Cut!
Okay, Wayne, step forward.
Oh my God!  Sorry.
What?
Anything.
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Tough titty, it's mine now.
Look, I'll trade you.
Yes, sir.
Not good.
Do you have a back up.
It's video.
Ready.
Wagons, hooaaa!
Whose ratings were higher?
Yours.
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
What I'd like to do---
Manson beat you.
Not to anybody. She sings.
She sings? What does she sing?
Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.
Don't worry about it.
Was what worth it?
Describe Mallory.
Says the United States of America.
When have they ever been right?
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
Where's it parked?
Out front.
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
So, what now?
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
Mickey, you're wasting time!
You made every day like kindergarten.
Unfortunately, yes.
I do, too.
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
They've hypnotized the nation.
Yes.
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
They actually apologized.
Where do the air ducts lead?
Take a wild stab!
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
The entire wing?
That's my opinion.
Jesus...
Next week's episode.
Rockin'!
Scotty?
Wayne Gayle.
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
I assigned you Bingham and Washington to go along.
How 'bout Mallory?
Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.
Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
Perfecto!
Slate it.
Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!
They're mesmerising.
Really?
Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
Two guys?
Fine.  Julie, why don't you make a food run?  What's around here?
Out.
Want me to come?
No thanks.
Come on, honey.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
It sure is.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
What d'you say, Duff?
Hell, you got steady work.
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
You in a big hurry, boy?
That's right.
Want to talk to you.
Okay.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
You a union man?
Used to be. On the railroad.
What d'you think?
I'll smile when it's funny.
Where was that?
Walker and Williams.
What did you say your name is?
She done moved to Detroit.
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
I don't know. He's your boy.
'That right? I thought he was up North.
People seen him 'round.
Where's he at?
I don't know.
Name's Duff.
How 'you doing?
Okay.
Guess I don't.
Have anything in mind?
No. What you usually say, I guess.
Where was your father born?
I don't know.
Well, he worked around.
And his age?
Any other family?
No. Just me.  Me an' her.
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.
Okay, thanks very much.
That's right. How' you doin', Barney?
That ain't my idea of friendliness.
Yeah, I been there.
You must be new in town.
No. I'm new in town.
You working?
Yeah. On the section gang.
I'm a teacher.
Went to college, huh?
In Birmingham.
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
Your folks live there?
No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
What d'you expect?
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
You keep asking me why I'm here.
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
I like a place with lots of life.
How about another beer?
No thanks.
Go on - you can have one!
What is it?
Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
I see. That beer made me dizzy.
Don't Duff--
Take it easy.
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
You almost got into trouble back there.
I wouldn't have let you.
Oh yeah, and then what?
What?
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
That's the way he is.
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
What d'you mean?
Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
Just for the day?
Goin' to see my kid.
Yeah. Well, I do.
No, I ain't married.  Well, good-bye.
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
That's right.
I'll see you later.
What's he like?
What?
Your boy.
I'll have some coffee, please.
How about it?
What happened, Duff?
Well, what d'you think?
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
That's all right with me. Always liked kids.
He could live with us.
Yeah, that's so.
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
Duff - you know those women you used to know--
Am I as good as they?
Hmmm - good coffee.
You didn't answer my question.
Well, if you don't know I can't tell you.
Uh-huh. Why?
Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
I don't want to hurt you.
Go on - hit me!
Don't look so scared.
You jivin' me?
Well, I haven't come around.
We'll be all right.
How come you keep askin'?
I keep thinking about him.
Day work.
What're you going to do?
Watch out!
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
Nothin. Quit lookin' at me like that!
There's nothing to say.
Well, that'll be the first time.
When I get set, I'll send for you.
I don't think that'll happen.
Duff--
Why don't you relax, Frankie?
What's so hot 'round town?
How 'bout the key?
I bet she's easy jam.
Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.
Like what?
Like a home, for one thing.
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
Yeah, see you in hell.
'Bye, Jocko.
Who're you?
What's on your mind?
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
Okay.
Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.
No.
'Don't sound so sure.
I heard you.
Beat it!
Didn't I tell you to beat it - huh?
Okay.
Just tryin' to be helpful.
She'll do.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
I said, she's in great shape.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
How often is that?
Yeah, sure. Good luck.
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
That's right.
They'll run you out.
No, they won't.
How 'you gonna live?
Hell, I'm just like him.
I know he wasn't much of a father.
Good-bye, Duff.
How are you?
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
Don't you get smart with me, boy.
It's for your own good.
How you doin'?  Hi there!
What're you gonna get out of it, huh?
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Well, I got married to one of them.
Hell, I didn't know you was married.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?
I'll talk to the Mayor.
He's my son!
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
You're breaking my heart.  Got to see a man about a dog.
Okay, boy, beat it.
I ain't drunk, honey.
Like hell you ain't!
Better now.  Where 'you at?
Right here.
Anything you say, baby.
Enough talking!  We been talking for eleven fucking hours, man.  My throat's fucking raw!
I'm still on my honeymoon.
Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
No. I only needed the code from you.
She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
Of course...
The Elders, mon...
Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
Why not?
And how do you suggest I do that?
Sense/Net's corporately financed. Too corrupt to be trusted. You of all people should know that.
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
Good, because you've got a new one.
What are you talking about?
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
Did you trace it?
No, but it traced me.
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
You see the couple up in the balcony?
We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
This ain't Bangkok, chief.
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
The words?
No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?
It's Case. Remember me?
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.
All things possible in Babylon.
This place empty as a tomb, mon.
The girl 3Jane. We need her.
Can you walk?
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
Maybe so...
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
Never heard of him.
Nobody has.
Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it.
We got problems topside.
How's the ice break?
Less than thirty minutes.
You'd better be, Bro. You better be.
How's the ice?
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
I'm getting too old for this shit. One oh four and counting.
I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
What?
No!... No...
I thought you already left.
I don't know. I don't know...
And Linda...
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
Why should I want to meet him.
Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
What about before that?
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
What's that supposed to mean?
What?
Almost two days.
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
Go ahead...
If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
So you're a wire junkie.
...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
Put the gun down, Case.
Case...
Shhh...
I don't sleep much. You packed?
They'll cut you down.
Give me five minutes.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
For Peter, that's a short trip.
Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
No we don't...
What is it?
Hold on.
What?
What are you talking about?
Well, do you?
Sure. No problem.
Yeah, I know.
Yes, it's lame.
 uhh, must have forgotten-
I'm late for lab.
YOU KNIT?
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
Nope.
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
If you say so.
Roger in Op/Ed.
Who told!
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
When I finally get kissed, I'll know.
I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
Anita, remember espadrilles?
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
That is lingerie.
Very romantic.
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.

Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
Just get in the van, Josie.
Hidden camera.
Wings?
Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
Transitioned?
You crossed over.
Do I want to be crunched?
By Guy?
Rosalind and Orlando.  From "As You Like It"?  Shakespeare?
So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
Eh.
Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
A--flack jacket.
Geller, this is way out of your league.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Uhh, no.
Have you been to any parties?
They hid my car--
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
Dude, you rock!
Yeah, you gonna be there?
Hey. There.
I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
I'm Rob's prom date.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
See!
Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!
It was a long time ago -
Don't you remember what they called you?
Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
I can't do this.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
Little known fact.
That's the spirit!
And a gymnast!
Rufus?
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
Thanks. And what are -
Duh. Tom Cruise. "Risky Business".
Sorry. Forgetful.
You like her?
I love the way she writes.
College. Haven't really thought about it.
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
Thank you.
You remember that story?
Of course. I remember everything from your class.
Don't look down!
You have to say that. You're my student.
I don't have to say that.
I know.
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
When are you going to open your eyes?
I'm thinking when I'm home.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
Do you think you'll find her?
Yeah, actually I do.
Thanks. So do you.
No, I'm alone.
Yeah, I have.
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
I just can't look at you the same way.
I finally found my story.
What?
I don't know.
Who are you guys?
You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
Duh.
Yeah. Definitely.
Maybe we should sit.
Lock.
<i>                      I'm not the dumb one...</i>
Everybody knows about--
Barrel.
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
<i>                      Three of a kind...</i>
We can handle it.
And heavy...
Where?
For this.
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
Good.  I'm hungry.
No.
Why not?
Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.
He stayed a long time.
<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
<i>                      That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
<i>                      Now and forever...</i>
<i>                      Shut up and listen...!</i>
It's getting there.
Don't be a smart ass.
Just out for a while.
I told you I want that room unpacked.
Oh, come on Dad...
No.  Upstairs.
It's not the gas, Dad!
Don't tell me it's not the gas!
Ken!
Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
I'm Jesse now, Lisa.
Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.
I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
He's dead, you bitch.
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
You got a problem with me, Grady?
Naw. Just killing time.
What the hell are you talking about?
It was okay.
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
Schneider's always got a stick up his ass.
Only the wet ones.
What are you doing here?
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
Are you nuts or something?
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
It's happening again.
Ah, nothing.
Look at this car.  Are you kidding?
That's okay, I wanted to.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Let me look at your eye...
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
You mean a shithead.
Uh-uh.  Before my time.
Traumas of a ten-year old.
You don't have to.  You just have to believe in energy.
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
Make a left at this corner.
It's a surprise.
What's this?
C'mon, cut it out.
I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.
Uh-uh.  Wait...
About what?
About not finding any bogey men?
Whoa!
What is it?
I don't know - a sharp pain.
Oh, Jesse...
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
You want to talk about it?
I'm not hungry.
Will you leave me alone?  Please.
I killed him!  I killed him!
Who?  Who's doing this to you?
'Morning, honey.
Huh?
Eggs?
Okay, I guess.
Making friends?
No.  I'm okay.
I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
Fine.
Hi, Kerry.
Yor dad picking the music again?
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
Okay...thanks.
We're going to bed.
Thanks, Mom.
Did she always have nightmares?
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
First door up the stairs.
That's right.  I don't.
I thought I'd wait for you.
Can't it wait till morning?
Please Mom?  I just don't want to be alone.
Morning, Doctor Goldman.
How's your hand?
They're healing up nicely.
Watching TV.
Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
Last time, it was me against him.  I wasn't strong enough...alone.
No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
He's close...
To old friends.
Yes.  I'm going to see her tonight.
I -- I think so!
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
That was different.
He's heavy in the halls...
How do we find him, Kristen?
They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
I think so.
I'm so proud of you all.  Tell Neil I...
Can't be good news coming from you.
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
So?
Those are ancient history.
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
It'll be my last chance.  Pleese?
Thank you.
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
You know what he did.  He's doing it again.
Nancy...
What's that supposed to mean?
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.
Call me Nancy.
Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
Well, we've got --
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
That's right.
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
For what?
The truth.
Try me.
Remember -- open mind.
Everybody take five.
There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.
There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.
Hey, everybody has bad dreams.
Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
What about Kristen?
We can't get to her.  I've tried.
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
They used to keep a spare key.
What?
Listen.
No.  We're alone.
A sad choice.
I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
Cooling down.
Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
This is stupid.
C'mon.
Yeah?  What did we ever do?
Where...here?
Me too.
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
Oh God.
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
Well... a shot at it.
I'm delighted.
Night, night, Honey.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
I'm not listening.
And then I... right.
Here, let me help.
No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
Coffee?
No.
Orange juice -- probably not.
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
I forgot my bag.
Thanks.  Well...
Hi.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
Hello.
I brought these, but clearly...
Yes.
Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
Okay.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
That's fine.
I thought you were leaving.
I was.
What did you say?
Nothing.
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't.
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
She left me.
Why?
Uh-oh.  That's not good.
I don't know either.
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
Why?
I think goodbye is traditional.
Come in.
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
I have thought about you.
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
My son's name is Johnny?
Yup.
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
What do you think?
You think I should do Henry James instead?
Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
Yes.  Always have had.
Big feet -- large shoes.
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
Okay.
What?
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
Stay forever.
Damn, I forgot the jam.
Don't ask.
Jesus.
How do you think I'm doing?
I don't know what happened.
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to...
But... wait... there are things to say.
You disappeared.
Thank you.  Shall I...
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
Yes.
Can I have your autograph?
What's your name?
Rufus.
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Miracles do happen.
Does the girl have a name?
He wouldn't say.
Christ, what is going on in there?
And this is William.
Yes.
The movie star?
Yup.
No!
Don't even ask.
In a depressingly asexual way.
I never fancied you much actually...
Tony -- what do you think?
That's nice.
What?
Is Miss Scott staying here?
Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
Where's Bella?
No -- it's my 22nd.
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
Da Vinci?
Di Caprio.
Me?
Yes.  What do you think?
Well, yes.  Groovy.
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
You daft prick!
It was good.
Still, not sparkling.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
What's your name?
Ahm... Bernie.
Mr. Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound.'
Yes?
Have you got a moment?
This is Henry James film?
Well, fire away.
Any bit in particular?
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
Yes, better get me a half.  All I can afford.
That's right -- Topol.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
So it could have been neither of them?
Can I help you?
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
No, it doesn't.
Do you ever masturbate?
Definitely no comment.
I think you do, yes.
No -- did you?
She's perfect, perfect.
I believe I have.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
No, don't think I do.
So not over her, in fact.
Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
May I help you, sir?
How about Miss Flintstone?
No, sir.
Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Does she know you're coming?
No, no.  She doesn't.
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
Well... wait for it...  First there's this one...
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Good luck.
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Hi...
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Two?  That's it?
What?
Oh shit, is that the time?  I have to go.
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Sort of.
Yes.
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
No -- you're right.
Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
Why not?
Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Three.
Yes.
Oh.  Right.
Fabulous.
Yes.
Bad news.
What?
The one down your trousers.
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
But you have no proof.
And yet you suspect her.
Yes, that is correct.
No. Mister Harding, that is not true.
Would you like to start?
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
Tell us about it...
Billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love?
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
Who? Tell me!
M-M-Muh-Muh-McMurphy!
No! No! No!
Hold the fort down, will ya, fellas!
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Yes, ma'am.  Lead the way, Sam.
Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
On this ward?
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
Oh, I had them removed.
What for?
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
Yes. Now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly.
Right!
Go on...
Yeah?
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
A vote is before the group.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
No, it was irresponsible!
Yes, ma'am?
Welcome back.
Thank you, ma'am.
I hope everything is settled.
Thank you, ma'am...
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
Thank you, ma'am.
Please see to Mister Bromden.
Yes, Miss Ratched...
Yes, Miss Ratched...
B-B-Billy.
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
Shhh...
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
Go ahead! Go back!
Yeah, kid?
C-C-C-C-Candy!
M-M-M-Mack?
Thank you.
God Bless America.
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Yeah...
Are they all crazies?
What? Where?
Wow! They're so quiet.
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
What for?
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
Atta boy, Cheswick!
It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.
Come here!
Let me get on your shoulders.
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
Where ya goin', Mac?
Shhh...
They went that way.
Yeah!
Hey, what's that?
I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
Shhh...
Through the ass.
Me, too...
Me too...
My feet hurt...
What?
Your buddy is callin' ya.
I'm seeing what a busy man does.
Lobotomy!
Lobotomy?
That!
She's not all that homely, Mister McMurphy. In fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady.
You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
With your own two hands?
You heard me the first time!
Okay, Harding, you're on.
Okay, sucker.
Just warmin' up.
So why are you talking to him?
What for?
I'm busting outta this place.
That's nice. Send me a post card.
Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
I was open! Come on, let's play ball!
I said out!
No!
I'm the coach!
I just started!
You can come back later!
I don't trust you!
Scanlon out!
No!
Let me see your hand!
No!
No!
Why not?
I'm not running a charity ward...
Just wait till you hear...
Hear what?
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
Yesterday...
Who told you that?
Gary Blinker...
Can you borrow me a dime?
Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta change...
What's this?
That's a dime, Martini.
Whadaya bet, Cheswick?
A nickel.
Yeah, Mac?
Bye-bye.
No. Me! Me!
Me, too! Me, too!
Me too! Me too!
Yeah, it's cold!
I'm hungry.
No.
What is it?
He's not!
He is!
McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
I see.
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
That's correct, Doc ...
No, this is my first trip, Doc.
Good. Good.
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
I'm afraid not.
I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
We'll let you know.
Time out!
Replacement coming in! Harding out!
Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back!
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
Shhh!
Are you a doctor?
No, 'fraid not...
I'm the next one.
How do ya know that?
Because I quit breathing.
You're breathin' right now.
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
What's going on?
Yeah!
How much ya wanna bet?
Ten bucks.
Shhh!  This way!
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
Okay. Who else?
Yeah, what's up?
Shhhh. See ya around the ball park.
Martini out!
Our prayers have been answered, Turkle! Our prayers have been answered!
Come an' see.
Okay. How you doing?
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
What are they?
To help you relax... please...
You an' me, Chief.
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
You comin' in to hold my hand?
Oh, yeah...
Yeah...
He can't hear you, Rose. He's just a big deaf an' dumb indian...
He's in charge.
Are you a doctor?
Hi.
Big man!
On what?
Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy.
Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Yes, ma'am...
After you, ma'am.
Thank you.
Thank you, ma'am,
Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
Asshole.
How 'bout twenty?
Now you talkin'.
Bet!
Bet you ass...
You're a witness, Doc!
Jus' playin' the game, sucker...
Take you han's offa me!
Evenin', ma'am.
Is everything all right?
Why, sure, ma'am...
At this hour?
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
What's that?
What?
That!
Is he in an asylum?
He's dead.
No, she wasn't my sister.
Your mother.
Of course not.
Your grandmother?
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
Because.
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
What's she doing?
No.
Yes.
Let's find a telephone.
We found each other, didn't we?
Yes.  We did.
What great aunt?
No.
Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
Ask her if she knows where he is?
What's mezzaluna?
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
Wait.  I have to write this down.
Okaaaaayyyy.
What?...
Hi there...
Thanks.
I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
Smoking or non-smoking?
Non.  Please.
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
I'm at the airport.  Why?
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
You said whatever it was you would understand.
That was before I found out what it was.
I'm in love with you.
Are you okay?  You want some help?
If it's any of your business, yes.
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
To the foot doctor.
Yes.
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
You didn't answer my question.
So it wasn't real.
Because.  I know where he is.
Tell me.
I'd really rather not say.
Please.  I need to know.
Mickey Spillane.
Mickey Spillane?
Hi.
Yeah.
Well, good.  Good for you.
What?
Nice dress.
What are you doing here?
We were hungry.
Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that?
The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--
The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
Yeah.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
No.  Are you're leaving?
No.  I just came by to apologize.
In that case... no...
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
Okay.  I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.
GET OUT!!
What?
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
I can't believe you did that!
What would you call it?
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
I brought you that, too.
Uh huh.
Beautiful place...
Sure is.
Just since yesterday.
Any night.
Well, not exactly...
You would?  Really?
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
Yes?
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
Really...
And more...
Don't worry about it.  You're my guest.
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
You like shrimp?  I like shrimp.
Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
Oh, hello.
Mommy, this is Faith.
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
How about the other one?  His friend.
How about that guy at the bank?
Oh.
So, what's your point?
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
Is he married?
No.
Is he gay?
I don't know.  I don't think so.
I don't know, Kate.
You don't have any idea?
He's a podiatrist or something.
Why don't you ask him?
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
Is that bad?...
I think he's having an affair.
No...  I can just tell.
It's a coincidence.
It's still the new year...
What about your job?
I have vacation time coming to me.
You don't have a passport.
Maybe.
What?
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
He fell out.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?
A Butterfinger wrapper.
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
What is it?
A phone message.  Only--
Only what?
Only, it's in Italian...
Nothing.
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
'Course he does.
Polo.
Right.  My brother.
You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
Because I'm the one who's single.
I never even got to be single.
Sure you did.
Oh my God.  Where?
Nope.
What?
Good luck.
I meant about my idea.
I think it's time we got some professional help.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Hi.  Where've you been?
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Packing.
Why?
A little bad luck?
It was a ouija board, remember?
...and a fortune teller.
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
What?
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
Is Damon Bradley here?
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
And he is living proof.
Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
Yes.  He is.
What about Larry?
Kate.
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
A porco?
I thank you.
That's exactly what you are.
What?  You know him?
He missed me.
She didn't give me a chance.
She's not here.
Where is she?
Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
Sorry...
You know Johnny when he gets mad.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
Well, where are they?
I'm not thirsty.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
But my own kid bro
It's a living.
Nolan? I knew he had guts but
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
ex-tanker who's walking on his heels ?
Don't say that!
What the hell!!!
I could have been better!
The point is there isn't much time, kid.
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
"In the church when you need me." Was there ever a saint who hid in the Church?
Hello, Edie.
Tommy, what happened?
Terry... Terry... .
What makes him so special?
None of your business.
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
They play pretty rough.
Which side are you with?
I'm with Terry.
I'll get home all right now.
I better see you get there.
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
You training to be a nun or something?
I want to be a teacher.
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
I can get home all right from here
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
Do you like pigeons?
I don't know.
You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
He had a few birds.  I got up and fed 'em this morning.
How do you like that one?
Oh she's a beauty.
I don't know.
How do you like it?
It's quite  nice.
How about another one?
No thanks... .
Naw, in the ring, a dive is-
What a fruitcake you are!
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts!  You really believe that drool?
Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
What for?
For not being any help?
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
That goes double for me.
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
It was Johnny Friendly who killed Joey, wasn't it?
Go ahead, wear it.
Terry, what's wrong?
I've been sittin' in the church.
The Father. The Father.
I just told the Father.
Told him what?
What I did to Joey.
You... .
What I did to Joey.
Don't tell me don't tell me!
Edie it's
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
Get away from me.
Get out of my way.
No, I can't let you. I can't, you're
Well, it's over.
Terry...?
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
Pop!
Let me by.
I'll find you a priest.
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
A question of who rides who.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
Now don't give me a hard time.
What do you want from me, Father.
Mind your own business, Father.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
You go to hell.
What did you say?
You go to
I can? Okay.  Okay...
But you still hold out for silence?
Are you on the level, Father?
What do you think?
So help me God!
What about it?
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
Take it easy.
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
You want to know something I would have taken Wilson
I'm just resting my feet.
I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
Yeah, really!
Raise a hand to me and... .
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
You'd be off the pier for good.
O.K., O.K., That's enough.
My ain't we touchy this morning?
Gimme the names, I'll write 'em down in me little book.
Doyle.  Joey Doyle's... .?  ... .You're his... .
No.
Take it easy now, Terry.
Keep the advice. Give me the whiskey.
Easy. Easy, boy.
Hey look-
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
I'll see you on the roof.
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
Forty-five bills.
Hey, Terry, front and center.
So-so, Johnny.
Don't hit me, now, don't hit me!
It's good for you. Develops your mind.
My favorite little cousin.
Thirty-six sev aah I lost the count.
I got it. Hot off the press.
What do you mean?
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
Thanks for nothing, you bum.
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.
You don't think he'd be helpful?
Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
Maybe I will one of these days.
One of these days.
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
I do not joke in my proposal.
No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
Who's to say my monsters aren't alive?
In there.
It frightens me.
Then..then what's that music?
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
I'm not sure...
What do you mean?
Be careful!--They'll see you.
Don't let them hear you.
What can we do?
Whatever you do, don't do that.
Be careful!
I am--It's our only chance.
Nothing is worth your life.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
You're talking nonsense.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
Of course I do.
A situation easily remedied.
Tie them that they may watch.
A symbol, Master.
What kind of symbol?
El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
It would seem so, Master.
Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
When!?
The moon is almost gone!
Ahh, there is yet time.
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
Well then let us proceed.
For what!?!
Your pleasures of course!
You may take her now.
Is there time?
You better hope there is.
Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
Yes, Master.
Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
You know better than that.
We don't know of anything, Master...
Then why do you shake so?
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
What do you suppose for?
Without the snake, of course.
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
I said not as a rule.
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
Yes, it is.
Uh-- sorry.  Wrong number.
Who is it?
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
He didn't want me to.
Why not?
He'd call every once in a while.
He called the day he escaped.
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Who are you?
Thank you.
Yes.
You did work for Emil, right?
You were his what, his box?
His assistant.
Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more.
Okay, honey, come on out of there.
I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Just that she got away.
You better come see this.
I'm a tourist.
You at least bring the gun?
Sure looks that way.
Let's go to Detroit.
Now you're talkin'.
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
Just hung up.
How long you talk to her?
Two hours.
Forty-five minutes.
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
Yeah, I did.
I get that feeling, yeah.
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
And who watches your back?
I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
I don't ski.
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
Yeah, hi.  Nice house.
They sure do.
Shit.
What?
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
And then they'll kill 'em.
At least.
All you gotta do is get in.
I'll go with you.
Daniel Burdon, FBI.
In the trunk, yeah?
What'd you talk about?
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
It was an unusual experience.
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
You have to know what you're talking about.
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
They're in 7D.
You're gonna use a ram?
Yeah, why?
The manager's door is metal.
Wait.  You not Adele?
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
What do you want to bet?
I could walk out of here.
Excuse me, Adele?
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
Why you think is today?
How are you, Raymond?
Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer.
No, I didn't know that.
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
Wait, I know him --okay?
Yeah.
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
Another C.
The fuck you talking about?
Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is...
You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
Nervous?
A little.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.
In my bag, in the car.
One I gave him, yeah.  Fuck...
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
Why, are you famous?
I thought so, too.
Of course I am.
You don't act like it.
You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
We still talk, though.
Sure.
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
I mean, romantically.
Yes.
None of your business.
Really.  He has a cop's face.
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
Think I could have them back?
How do we do that?
Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
Why not?
Because you're having too much fun.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
I just thought maybe you and me could--
Don't leave me.
Those guys bother you?
Love it.
What, as a sales rep?
A girl.
It smelled.
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
How far do we go with this?
It's not a game.  Something you play.
Well, does it make sense to you?
I called your room from downstairs.
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
So do you.
That's not what you were about to say.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
Yeah, but in a nice way.
Outside Adele's.
To warn her about Chino.
So she did help you?
I don't think we should get into that.
I'm just going to the bathroom.
Pretend I'm somebody else.
You think I'd shoot you?
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
I told you, I'm not going back.
You just did, for Christ sake.
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
I see better with them on.
You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
The backseat.
These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
I hear six.
When?
Looks like tonight.
You know who they are?
Must be a real soft pillow.
Any time.
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
It works.  You should try it sometime.
The next time I walk into a bank.
What's to think about?
Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..."
How are you, Richard?
Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.
We'll go to my bank.  I'll make a withdrawal.
I'm not leaving Midge.
What's it mean, "No Hair"?
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
For a time.
Meaning?
Meaning time came, I left.
You busted out?
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
There were others.
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
The <u>ninth</u>?
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
I remember you now.  Shit.
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
Glenn, take the exit.
Jesus, I don't believe it.
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
Gee, I wonder why not.
I'm freezing my ass off.
It's a guy you know.
It's Richard Ripley.
If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open.
Right now, son.
Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl.
How you know that?
I can tell.
I <i>was</i>...
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
What do you want?
I'm looking for Maurice.
Thanks.
You not with probation, one of those?
You a lawyer?
He said he stayed here last November.
Here?  In this house?
Got run over by a car.
What did you call it?
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
Something better.  Open it.
It's a --
--Sig-Sauer .38.  I love it.
Technically.  They're separated.
Oh, he's moved out?
He's about to.
Can we change the subject?
What're you doing at Glades?
You used to like it.
Dad...
We don't get to talk much any more.
What'd I say?
Huh.
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
No, he looks a lot...
Off a tip?
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
Not at all.
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
I didn't have time.
I imagine you would've though.
It's possible.  Why?
I told you, he isn't here.
Out for the evening?
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
When's he due back?
I don't have any idea.
Like a fag.
Yeah, as soon as we got back.
Still...
Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
Where you been hiding, Dick?
Where the fuck is Foley?
Are they dead?
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny, you coming?
No, I was.
You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.
Only when I'm n-n-n-
Too late for apologies, Walker.
Where's that lizard?
What lizard?
What the hell happened to you guys?
You guys are new?
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
Yeah, but he was wearing shoes!
They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...
You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.
Power dive!
Kill the bastards!
Good shooting, Rafe!
Land of the free...
Home of the brave!
There's another one!
The Colonel helped me work it out.
Some other time.  I don't feel like a party.
If you can't keep up, don't drink yours.
What facts are those?
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
So what are you saying?
How's this for a fact?  I loved her first.
Come on!
Six P-40's.
Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
Home of the brave.
I'm out of fuel!
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
We've always tried to beat each other.
Longer?  It's getting shorter.
Home of the Brave.
I can't make it.
Yes you can.
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
From the air?
I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
Y-Yes Sir.
We can explain, Colonel.
Explain what?
Sorry to trouble you.
Boxin'.
Win?
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
What do you get for winning?
You too, 'Mam.
You too, Lieutenant.
Nice to meet you, Betty.
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
We must go ahead.  This is our moment.
Learn English, then!
Fook ya dooble!
Crank her!
It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her.
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
Peggy Sue!
You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
Who knows. Remember...  Whatever Walter wants...
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
I can't. It's all too much.
Go on. You can do it.
Were taking you back to the nurse.
Maddy, what did you do to your hair?
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
That loudmouthed little bitch~
It's that jerk Walter.
What happened?
Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
Why do guys do such stupid things?
Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
Don't say that...
I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
And nothing will ever change that.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
I'll think of a way to sell, them.  One day.
Pretty strange.
I call this the staccato. 
Would I?!! Why I oughta...
Thanks.
Yeah. Like that.
Good.
Great, isn't it?
Is this slow enough for you?
Charlie, how are you?
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
Save it.
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
I have to talk to you..
Let's go down to the basement.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
How'd you know about that?
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
That's real big of you.
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
Right here. Now sit down.
It opens, too. Look inside.
I know.
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
I've got to go now.
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
I'm trying.
I thought you were...for a while.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
I'll just set it right here.
Then hold me.
Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you.
Touchy, touchy!
Take a long walk on a short pier.
Have a nice day.
Okay.
What, why?
First a nerd and then a weirdo. What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll tell Charlie.
It must run in the family.
Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
Coffee and a donut.
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
I hate chickens.
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Thank God for that.
All right. But this better be good.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
Doing some shopping?
Open it.
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
The hat business is in trouble.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
He'll win.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
You have four seasons, you have four slumps.
We'll make it, we'll be fine.
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
How do you feel?
I'm excused.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
I'm home now.
Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
What about?
The house payments.
Sure, Mom.  Hello.
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
I had a dream that Grandma died.
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
Maddy's party.
I don't feel very festive.
Way to go, Mom!
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
I'm just happy to see you.
Okay, what do you want? What dumb favor do you want me to do?
Why not? They're my favorite.
They're bad for you. They cause...red lips. 
Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
Rosalie Testa!
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.
Dancing with you.
You're a sweet man, Richard.
It really wasn't that difficult.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
What's that?
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
You're giving me the creeps.
Am I dead or not?
There's one way to find out.
What if you're not here tomorrow?
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
When do we start?
Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
Oh.	And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous.
What are you doing?
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
What do you know about hypnosis?
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
One... two... three.  You are now awake.
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.
I suppose so.
There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
Yes... why?
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
I'm going out, Dad!
I'm not hungry.
All set.
Anywhere but here.
Just until he heals up?
Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are.
Zowie.
He pissed me off.
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
I'm not burying him here...
Why not?
There's a better place...
Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
He was dead. You know he was.
You think he'd believe it if he did?
Maybe it takes a while...
I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
Right here, Mom...
You know everything, don't you?
In a word, Bob...
You'll never find it in the dark.
Bob...
What's wrong with your face?
Sorry...
K-R-O-one.
Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
Because they deserve to, Walter.
What's that on your forehead, pal?
There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
Really? Who thinks that, sir?
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
I said, don't worry about it.
A reaction to AZT...
You're not smiling.
Drew!
I promise!
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
Close the law book.
CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!
That's not what I said.
What's that mean?!
Maybe you should think about it.
I'm not going to die.
Ready for what, baby?
Whatever.
No sweat, buddy.
Of course.
More than your friend. Family.
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
I'm seeing him this afternoon.
We're waiting...
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
Funny.
I have AIDS.
It's okay. Can I sit down?
Uh, yeah.
One week old.
Congratulations.
Little baby girl.
Kids are great.
Continue.
My lover and I.
As in, the vegetable?
Fine.
What?
Find a lawyer?
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
What's her name?
Rayisha.
Rayisha. Very nice.
No. They didn't fire her.
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
Arline?
We're friends of Beckett's.
It's me, you dork.
I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
Not bad.
Get it?
Let's find you a drink.
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
Correct.
You're right.
Beckett?
Charles. Okay. Miller?
Do you... pray?
What happens?
We proceed, representing your estate.
You're ready, don't worry.
What impressed you about him?
I suppose you could say that.
Except... you were gay?
I still am.
I'm an excellent lawyer.
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
Thank you.
A good start.
You bet. We'll see you later.
Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.
Do you take risks?
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
Yes.
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
No.
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
Yes.
No. I can't really see it.
Thank you.
Hi, Mom. It's me.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Were you recently promoted?
Is that a question?
Thank you. No more questions.
I'm not worried. What are you doing?
Why are we going to do that?
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
Get real.
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
Uh.... No. Not really.
Were you pleased with his work?
We were satisfied.
It satisfied me.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
People who want to bend the rules...
Second.
Great.
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
Get a life.
How many do you know?
Lots.
Who?
Since when?
Probably since she was born.
Yeah... ?
Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.
Why should I?
A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
Any women on board?
Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
How did you do that?
Yes, we did.
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
On behalf of the defendants?
Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection.
You had one guy "like that?"
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
Dr. J.!
Andy, you don't want this.
You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?
Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
No matter how hard I try, I can't lose a file in my computer.
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
... It's time to get this society back on track!
Lookit. Lookit!
<u>What</u>?
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what.
Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
What whispers?
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
They're coming.
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
But I just wanted to say --
Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
Actually...  That's what I been askin' myself.
Get out of our way.
One or two.
Audrey?
You sure you can keep --
As fast as you can.
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
I can't....I can't....
Here. Make it easy on you.
Don't do this to me....
But they...they could still be....
I would try for them.
You barely know them.
It's starting....
Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
I know what's in here!
It hurts them. Light actually hurts them....
How many bottles?
Not sure. Ten?
What, switch what?
Hey, who?
Hey, me. Over here.
Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
Big Evil?
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
Which means he went toward sunrise.
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
What?
Like what?
So why isn't it all bloody?
I assume he licked it clean.
Thought you didn't believe his story.
So what happened? Where are they, then?
Wha'?
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
Never said you were a hype, either.
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
For your own fear.
What the hell's it matter?
How much?
79 kilos.
Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right?
Some prophet guy?
For now.
Riddick?
And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
What?
And what about the cells?
Rain.
Has anyone checked the coring room?
You mean....
Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.
Give my blessing to the girl. She needs a spare.
KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
I'm born-again.
The child heard you before any of us could even....
Please...this solves nothing...please....
Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
Not staying in here another....
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
How 'bout a cut in your gut?
Said "looks clear."
Well, what's it look like now?
Looks clear.
Just realized that, huh?
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?
So much for my cocktail hour.
What, it's broken?
Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
Do you have any weapons?
The best. But we won't need them.
Just the same, I want one.
It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?
Reconstructing a life. Care to have a look?
Neither do I.
Remembers what?
The blood transfusion.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
Where did you learn to do this?
Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
And they fell out of the sky with you?
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
It's probably wrong --
You didn't think so then.
Yo!
Geiger counter?
Good question.  Landon -- check your communications kit.
No.
That way.
Any particular reason?
None at all.
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
Sustained.
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
He's trying to form words.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
What signal?
Forget it. Abandon ship.
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
By our time.  You've turned gray.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better.
Let's take a look.
Try telling them our names.
Zira doesn't want your female.
I want her.
Fine. Just let her out.
I'm for that.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
Relax. You'll see it all later.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
All right...  Get in...hurry.  Put this on.
The Hunt Club.
To scare off humans?
A man, Dr. Maximus.
We're -- conducting a new experiment.
My name is Taylor.
Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
Identify him, then. Speak to him.
You lied. Where is your tribe?
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Okay.Up to the cave.
Cease fire! Withdraw!
No, thanks. I'll take freedom.
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking.
Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
What is this?
A hearing.
Which one?
Second from the left.
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
You want her that much?
She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
It's humiliating.
We can't.
All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
But perhaps he understood --
Like you, I find it difficult.
Where are they now?
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
Where?
He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!
How the hell did he get away?
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
YOU AIN'T A FIRING SQUAD, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!
Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. BAAD SHIT.
Says he can't walk.
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.
What?
You lame or something?
Barnes comes from Hell.
'Lias come naturally.
Over here!
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
Out there man - behind the log.
No!
Yeah. How 'bout you?
Yeah.
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
...beautiful night.
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
And you, do you believe?
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
Later...
...there's nobody.
What are you talking about! 
Merle? Jesus!... Patty?
Found it. Growing in a garden.
Sheeit, beats burning hutches anyway...
Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
You don't want to hear about it?
My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
How far does this train go?
Vancouver, B.C.
I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.
Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
Indefinitely?
I don't know.
You don't know.
Very nice Mitchell turns.
No thanks?
Thank you.
What's the matter?
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
I'm sure you have.
Would you mind?
Okay. You win.
Why certainly, baby.
Just drunk enough.
Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
What did you say his name was?
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
Whatever you say.
I didn't say anything.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
No thank you.
I don't.
How did you meet him?
He was a great boy for that. What else?
I'd rather wait until it does matter.
There wasn't any plane.
No thanks.
Bad enough.
He could hardly help suspecting you.
Quarter after one. Why?
Just who are you, anyway?
Dance? Here?
Why not?
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
We'll find out.
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
All right--following me.
Why?
Anything I can do about it?
No use waiting, then.
From you, I like it.
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
I don't think that's on the market anymore.  I'd like something much closer to the water.
They're going to arrest me.
I have my own warrant.  Stop a minute, please.
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
You leave it.
There would be a moon tonight.
That, and the fun of it.
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
You-killed-him?
Do you think I was faking?
If I did-I don't-now.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Beer?  Well, all right.
Beer or ale, Miss?
Ale. I don't mind.
Right, Miss.
I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him?
Yes.
Where's you get it?
A graduation present.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
I probably shall--after I've tortured you a little more.
You must come from pretty far South.
I've never been to Florida.
Who hasn't--one way or another?
I'd like to believe that. It's not too easy.
We try to be decent.
If I understand what you meant by that.
There isn't anything you can do.
I don't want to talk.
I've come here to arrest you for murder.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
I can't answer that.
What will they do to you?
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
Morning. Any calls?
All right. Get him.
I'm not interested in blind dates.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
For five hundred, what do I get?
I go home and paint the kitchen.
For two hundred?
Got it on you?
Got the information on you?
Get it in half an hour.
In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
Martini.
You, Killaine?
And without much discrimination.
Leave that one lay.
They still hang women in Canada, I've heard.
What's a buzzer?
So you're not a cop.
I've got good ears.
The usual grind.
Round of golf Saturday?
If I can get off.
She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
Yes, I've seen it before.
Well--good night.
Thanks.  I don't mind.
I never notice the view after the first week.
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
I have a warrant for her arrest.
That must hurt.
Doesn't answer the question.
The only answer I have for you.
It could have been an accident.
That COULD BE TOLD.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
Where would she go, anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
Wait a minute.  I'll go with you.
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
Where did it all come from?  Or is that a permissible question?
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
Mr. Mitchell.
A little something on account perhaps?
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
I'm afraid this is all for the moment.
Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
I don't think you locked your door.
What do you want?
And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
You told me when we'd identified this fellow--
Would you?
How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
The joint's not open, Mac.  Who's Brandon?
Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
You get it's brother.
So it seems Sergeant.
I've met her.
Unless the gun was slanted up.
I guess I'm just ballast around here.
Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.
I think so.
Where's the shell?
Should be over there.
You can find out.
Well.  What about it?
Oh nothing.
Are you always this witty?
Warm water, no doubt.
Positive?
Not quiet yet.
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
It does.  May I go now? 
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
How about Magruder?
He checks too.
That leaves two strangers.
So far.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
She might.
The card says so, doesn't it?
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine.  Where's the girl now?
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
But you still think she's innocent.
I do.
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
Nice.
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
You ought to know why.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
You don't have to make a pose of it.
What does it look like?
How long have you had it?
Years, why?
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
How about your new friend?
I told you she's just..
In an hour, Larry.
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
It's kind of you to see me.
And I'd like you to call me Ann.
I think you'll do very well.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
Yes.
Sit on that log, dear.
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
Keep me company.
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
I see.
Of course.
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
I'll have some of that.
...break away completely from--
And some of that.  Sorry.
No.  I'd want to--
Good.
Yes, please.
That's her.
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
I think it went on rather too long.
I couldn't bear for it to end.
And I didn't like that man.
Oh, but he was terrific.
You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
My real father?  Well, he was a flashback.
I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
Who?
I called you a taxi.
Very thoughtful.
Well, you know...
I have to be up early. 
Me too.
I bet.  Thanks for the drink.
Did she talk about me?
No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
Well, you should.
Might?
What did he want?
In your car
Why not.
Oh ... excuse me.  There's Nicholas.
To the airlift.
To the airlift.
Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
Not yet you know any of these people?
No jokes.  James is in love.
To the Fleet.
And the Argies.
The Argies.
Come on.  Hand over.
You approve!
Let me see.
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
I'm not sure.
Hello.
I'm waiting for your mother.
Okay, I will.
Have you come to talk about me?
Not at all.  History.
Suez.  1956.
They don't count.
I'm not here.
Dad.
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
I'll ring you in the next couple of days.
Well, it's worth seeing.
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
U-huh.
Darling Susan.
You're so famous now.
Voila!
You'd look naked without one.
Promise.
'Night.
Tom . .. bed!  Go on.
Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
And that's why you never went pro?
De nada.
Come with Tyler.  She knows.
No, Bells Beach, Australia.
Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
Once.
You gotta earn trust.
My man!
Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
I'll take that as a yes.
You do it... you first!
Okay!
But you're not alone.
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
Naw, you pull it!
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
You never were...
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
Sir?
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
Fine.
Surf conditions okay?
A little mushy.
What?
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
The fucking punks are surfers.
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
It's all balance, right?  And coordination.  How hard can it be?
Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.
Nice tattoo, Dietz.
This Zen master surfer.
No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
They took a left at the next light!
Nothing.
Figured you did.
Kid, get outta the way!!
Shrimp and fries.
Catch of the day.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
Meaning you were expendable.
Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
What?
Warm them up.
No.  I'm sorry.  I have to go. I'll, uh... I'll call you later. I'm sorry.
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
My name's Johnny Utah!
Who cares!
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
Something... in the trees...
You never did know when to quit.
The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
No more games.
Right behind you.
Anytime.
We both got scores to settle.
I saw it.
It's been a long time, General.
There's something else, Major...
Mmmnnn...?
I can't tell.
I think it's Hawkins.
Where the hell is his body?
He's not really my uncle.
They never are, dear.
I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
Thunder's a horse.  Come on.
Hope to be?
Storage, I think.
Not with those smokestacks it's not.
What?
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
You looking' for some company?
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
That's ridiculous.
Sit-and-spin.  Alright... why not?
No.
Stolen?
Not exactly.
If you can figure it out, be my guest.
New York.
What motel you staying at?
<u>Ho</u>tel.
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.
It pays.
So do day jobs.
Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean to.
You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
For the whole night?
For an hour.
You're joking.
Fine.
What's your name, lover.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Edward... you got it!
Exactly.
Diet coke.
Can I have some chips?
-- and a bowl of strawberries. Thank you.
Always.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
Uh-huh.
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
And why do you say that?
I've known a lot of everybody.
Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred.
They should be.  They're both good at it.
Oooh, thank god.
Just a romantic, that's you.
Yes...
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
I'd say you give a good dollar value.
"Occupational hazard".
No shit.  They expensive?
What?  Why?
What are assets?
Vivian --
I'm in town until Saturday.
Of course.  How much?
Five full nights... days too?
All right, two thousand.
Three.
Done.
Holy shit.
Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
Did you buy some clothes?
I got a dress, yeah.
Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
Any good?
I think you'll approve.
You're forgiven.
Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
Uh-uh.  No work.
Good.
Come with me?
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
Dinner can wait.
No.
He died a long time ago.
I think it's exciting.
What id we run into someone I know?
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
Vivian, what the --
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.
Shush.  Of course you can.
What if I lose it?
You won't.
I'll guard them and you with my life.
The opera.
I know.  I'm glad.
Did you?
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
I have to go to New York tomorrow.
You just did.
What do you mean?
It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
It was good.
It felt good.
Vivian...
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
Afternoon.
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
No.
Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!
I'll bring it back.
I'm here.
Do it.
Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Doing what?
Vivian's in sales.
I'm up.
Let him answer.
I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
Edward, we've been together ten years.
Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
I bet.  That was our rent!
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
Forget it.  We work for it.  We keep it.
He's not gonna want us.
Yeah.
Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
Who did you think?
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
Yeah... I know what you mean.
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
Wow, are you in deep shit.  You know he'll break your heart.
Do I!?  Momma!
And leave all this?  Not in a million.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
Rent.  You're late.
You bullshittin' me?
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
Oooh, I love those.
I leave extras, miss.
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
And who is that?
Vivian.
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
Will I like it?
You'll like it fine.
Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
They will serve salad.
But what if they serve soup?
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
I like steak.
Then you would use your--
Steak spoon! 
Miss Vivian.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
Yeah, well, I check out today.
You're not accompanying him to New York?
I'm just looking, thanks.
Yes.  Something... conservative.
Yes...
I don't think it would fit you.
Excuse me?
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Do you remember me?
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
I was in here yesterday.
Yeah.  Thanks.
Till they kill you. Yeah.
Then why bother curing me?
Of course.
Should I be?
Brides often are, I'm told.
I do not marry tonight.
Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
He knows I do not love him.
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.
With pride. What can I do for you?
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
Nothing you can say will upset me.
As you wish.
Of course you will.
But what if something happens to you?
Hear this now: I will come for you.
But how can you be sure?
This is true love. You think this happens every day?
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
There will never be a need.
You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
No. No. We have already succeeded.
Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist...
Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
What?
It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
I believe you -- So what happens now?
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
And a good thing too.
Anybody want a peanut?
Veer left. Left. Left!
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
He's really very short on charm.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
Yes, some of the time. 
True!
Yeah?
But you don't know where he is.
Have you any money?
Over the Albino, I think.
Where did you get that?
What?
I'll be right back.
What is it?
Open it up.
-- well, when does it get good?
I don't be-leeve this.
No. You could read a little bit more ... if you want. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.
What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
Someday, you may not mind so much.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
Do you want me to go on with this?
You want me to read this or not?
I don't understand.
Sire.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
It will not happen!
DEATH FIRST!!
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
And our assets?
Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.
Not yet.
Light him.
I thought he was with you.
In that case --
-- offer me money --
-- power too -- promise me that --
-- offer me everything I ask for --
-- anything you want --
Hah?
Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
Thank you.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
Nothing comes to mind.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
Then why are you smiling?
And what is that?
I am not left-handed.
No one of consequence.
I must know.
Get used to disappointment.
Okay.
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
You know what a hurry we're in.
I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
Morons.
Good. Then pour the wine.
I smell nothing.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
I will. And I choose --
Don't say another word, Valerie.
Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
Yeah, an hour.
A good hour. Yeah.
Have fun storming the castle.
Think it'll work?
It would take a miracle. Bye!
A little bit.
You are sick, that's why he's here.
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
Maybe he won't.
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
What are you saying?
"Of the silvery moon,
"Of the silvery mooooon,
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
"To my honey I'll croon,
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
"Honeymoon, honeymoon,
"Keep a shining in...
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
Oooooooops!
Ooooooops.
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
Well, sir, it seems ...
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, you're using up your time.
It's nothing ... nothing.
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
What you were saying.  Keep talking.
What was I saying?
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
Exactly.  And how long did it run?
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
I already have.  Come on.
Oh.
Then stick with Bialystock!
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
What is she gonna do here?
I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
Do you think he'll take the job?
Only if we ask him.
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
No way out.  No way out.
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
Double.  Double.  Double.
Shut up.
What is it?
"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
Vat about it?
Good.  I will make the preparations.
Come on.  Let's get going.
Qviet.  Qviet  This is very important.
Nice girl.
Call chauffeur.  Get car.
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
No.  We go. 
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
Get car.  Get car.
Very nice girl.
You can count on me-o, you dirty young man.
Here I come, ready or not.
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
And we'll finish playing the Contessa and Rudolfo.
I shall count the minutes.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Ta.  Ta.
By the sacred memory...
Of Siegfried...
Wagner...
Wagner...
Nietzche...
Nietzche...
Bismark...
Hindenburg...
The Graf Spee...
The Blue Max...
The Blue Max...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Heil you know who!
Good.  Good.  Now ve sign the contract.
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
Vat?
Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one and all in the light.
What have you done, LSD?
No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
We can't... we keep our money there!
Send for Goebbels.
Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
What did you tell the people?
I told them we invaded England.
Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
Groovy!
Oh.
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
Very early. Dawn.
Of which morning?
No one met her?
No.
Or arrived with her.
No.
What do you mean?
What?
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
Someone is sitting in that window.
If she paid you well?
Now, look...!
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.
No. I told you, she's confined...
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
Who are you, friend?
Money.
Must've needed it.
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
Sam, if she's here...
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
In the building ...  Mary starts for the building, glancing once in the direction of the Patrolman.
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
Okay. If you'll come along...
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
A lot?
Forty thousand dollars.
And the police haven't been able to...
With the forty thousand dollars?
Your Detective told you a nakedfaced lie.
Just what he told your detective.
May I talk to you?
Sure...
Is Mary here?
With you.
Where?
Don't you know?
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
What do you know about it?
Huh?
I hate tears. 
Is Mary... in trouble?
Yes.
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary.
You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.
Where... can I stay?
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
An hour! Or less!
And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?  Thanks.
Sam, I'm going.
You'll never find it.
Contemplate your... panic button.
Who's he?
He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.
Well?
Does that mean we can't...
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
Of course we will.
Alive.
Huh?
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
What?
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
Why not?
Bates.
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
The only girlish thing you have lost.
Sam. This is the last time.
For what?
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
Can you?
I can come down next week.
All right.
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
Sam, let's go get married.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
You have a vacancy?
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
Norman Bates.
You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
You'd know, of course.
I imagine so.
I'm looking for a private island.
What are you running away from?
Why do you ask that?
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
Why don't you go away?
To a private island, like you?
No, not like me.
Norman.
Alright, Miss... 
Good night.
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
Then I'm free to go...?
Is anything wrong?
No need to apologize...
Now what?
Why?
Please.
Have you two had breakfast?
I suppose you want a cabin.
Better sign in first, hasn't we?
Haven't any.
I'll show you the cabin.
Fine.
I didn't think so.
I don't know what you've been saying.
...Forty thousand dollars!
Leave me alone!
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
From what?
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
Just before she died she came to--
Did she talk?
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
Indeed, he has often told me.
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
I don't know, [I tell you].
I don't know--I can't tell--
Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
That's it. You get it quick.
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
He isn't here.
I'm going to call the police.
No, you can't do that--they'll get suspicious--
The wound is bleeding!
Go to sleep!
I'm losing my blood!
You're losing your blood?
Yes!
Nonsense! ... It's here! ... Your blood ...
A voice ...
That spoke to you?
That called ... commanded ...
What did it say?
Yes!
The master ... is asleep!
Yes, the child ...
Yes.
There's no child here.
But ... the dogs...
No!  Good night!
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
I wish you wouldn't be so sarcastic about Ralph. He's the sweetest kid I know.
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
Then marry Ralph ... you'll be the happiest couple in the world.
I'll have it for supper.  So long.
Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
I won't let you say that!
Well, I do say it.
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
I'd call it stupid at any time.
That's the way I feel about it.
I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
At any time. You will always be welcome.
The body of Joan Gale!
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
How quaint. But I can go any place you can. 
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
You give me a pain!
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
Nope, I'm through!
Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
Get out of here.
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
What!
Almost certain.
You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.
I don't remember. Not so very far--
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
No, sir. About three months ago.
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
How's every little thing?
Do you know George Winton?
Old Howard Winton's cub?
That's the one.
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
Thanks.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
That's what I said.
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
That happens to be the truth.
Who'd steal her body?
That's what they're going to ask you.
No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it. 
Darned if I don't! 
Oh, is that what caused it?
Heaven knows. A lot.
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
You are asking to burn these people ... you are asking? ... 
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
I will only be gone about half an hour.
Yes.
I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
He can't hear you.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
You did.
Yes....
Day or night?
Okay.
Where to?
A place you've never been.
That's the physicist's playground.
It's an experiment.
A quantum one.
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
Is Rose here?
But who were they?
They were just bad men, that's all.
In what sense were they bad?
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
Did they try to induce you to become a prostitute?
There was this old man that ate his niece.
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
What did you expect?
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
Aw, be a good sport, Rose.  You like me, don't you? I like you a lot.
'Course it does.
Don't mention it.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
Buddy, you're just a child.
But Rose...
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
Buddy, Mr. Right is out there somewhere and I'm gonna find him!
You're my sweetheart.
Buddy, I'm scared, I'm scared!
Take a little walk with me, huh?
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
All right, what do you know?
Rose is madly in love with Daddy...
Well, a little.
No. Why should Rose be in my room?
The girl strikes like a cobra.
Yeah, he's still up there.
What's taking the rascal so long?
Daddy, what's the matter?
No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
What did you say, Brother?
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
What'd you say, Brother?
Oh, yes, it's Thursday.  Hello, Rose, dear...  ... my, you're... looking pretty...
No, he doesn't. Not really.
She's watching the car again?
Yeah.
At least.
I can't see, let me see...
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
What are they doing?
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
What are they doing, Doll?
He kissed her.
Is that all?
He had his hand on her titty.
Let me look.  Aww-rr...
Buddy, that was my place.
Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
Dumbness doesn't concern her, Doll. And neither does smartness. You see --
Here comes Daddy.
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
It's Yankee whisky to me.
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
That's what she would say herself.
A wonderful woman, boy.
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
I think we both know her.
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
I'll take him with me downtown.  And you, too, Rose, if you want a ride.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
What time is it?
Quarter of twelve.
Is she all right?
I don't see any bruises or broken bones.
No reason at all, darlin'.
Yes, darlin', time will tell.
Darlin', it is not my fault if the girl has epizootics --
Boys? You say to me boys?
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
I'll talk to her, I'll reason with her.
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
Fine.
I'm afraid it's my fault. I made her feel guilty this morning --  Brother, what are you doing up?
Calm down, Rose, let's calm down and discuss it ...
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Is anything wrong?
No, sir.
Well, good night.
Got yourself up?
Yeah. I'm goin' out.
There are more on the other side.
Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
You don't know where you're going?
Yes, sir.
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
I'm not hungry.
Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!
What's the use, there ain't none.
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
Well. What kinda job is it?
Your baby?
No, you're not.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
Nothing, Rose.
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
Oh. Oh, God. Of course, Dave, how are you?
Galley what?
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
She has other things to do, Dave.
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
Yes. Well. She's upstairs.
More history, Rose.
Well, I am working on my thesis.
Yes, Ma'am.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe... one of 'em... was Foster... but I don't hardly know him!
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
No more dentists, no more dentists...
It'll get better now.
I don't mind.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
You're not gonna see him again.
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
Incestuous.
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Now you know what to watch for...
Careful she doesn't hit her head on the way.
Again.
She's fine, as if you cared.
Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella.
What'd I say?
What, am I supposed to read it while I drive?  Keep a grip on it, alright?
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
Save it.  Just go.
What do you want me to do about it?
No you can't.
Get ready.
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
We should slow down.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
I got him.
Who's that?  Zimmermann's money-man?
Could be worse.  I don't know how, but I'm sure it could.
Well, they sure know how to hold a grudge.
Wh... what... ?!
The booze.
Dean Martin.
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
What about him?
They shot us all, kid.
What day is it?
Same day as before.  I think.
We're gonna rain on Zimmermann's parade.
Feeling great.
You don't smoke.
Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
Birth control's important.
No, but it should.
What was I supposed to do?
You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
We have to find Kittle.
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
No, we're stealing.
Can't you say something nice once?
I'm waiting till the time's right.
General Jim Beam, then.
Nope.
Go wherever you want.  Live how you want.
Bummer.
We've got the tape to prove it.
Not like this.  Are you even listening?
You going rogue on me?
Maybe.
Can't I?
Don't bother.  This behavior's gone on too long.  You're suspended.
Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead and finish up.
You are such a disappointment, Benny.
Going into Zimmermann's pipeline.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
You know what I mean.
Absolutely.
Slow down.
No you're not.
No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
You think this is so easy?
Can't be worse than you.
Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
Is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice?
Whatever goes bang.
All for one...
Out here.  On your knees.
Dead.
Just got here.
How'd we do?
A.D. is a C.P.A.
Your wish is my command.
Billy!  Billy!
Know what I love about dynamite?
Do tell.
Yeah.
It's one of a kind.
So are you, Pop-Sweet.  That's why...
Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
Yoda will always be with you.
But I have no sister.
I can't see.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Where am I?
Jabba's palace.
Who are you?
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
Luke!
Are you all right?
Fine. Together again, huh?
Wouldn't miss it.
How are we doing?
The same as always.
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
Hi, Han... Chewie.
Yeah, she's comin' up.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
We got separated.
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
Leia!
I don't know.
Ahhh...
Hold me.
Charges!  Come on, come on!
Here's the terminal.
He wasn't. I can feel it.
Lando!
Lower it!
I'm trying!
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
You, too.
All right, hang on.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Come on! Come on!
Oh, Artoo, hurry!
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
Red Leader standing by.
Here goes nothing.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
Your Royal Highness.
I see them. Wait, Leia!
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Tell me.
Vader is here...now, on this moon.
Your father?
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
Then you know why I have to face him.
But, why must you confront him?
I know, father.
So, you have accepted the truth.
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
I will not fight you, father.
I will not fight you.
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
Your father he is.
Yes.
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
Yes or no will do.
Oh. Well, yes.
Certainly not!
Oh well.  How about you.  
Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
On my mother's grave.
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
Rocky!
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
I've got something to say.
Uh huh.
For you.
Dammit, Janet.
Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.
We must have a blow-out.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
It's just a..a party Janet.
Well I want to leave.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
Weiss.
It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
Oh don't be so shy.
Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
You know this earth - this person.
Yes.
You're OK by me.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Makes you cry
Makes you cry
From Transexual Transylvania.
"Transylvania"
Now I
Want to come again and stay
Oh my, my,
Smile and that will mean I may

The delivery boy.
Creature of the night.
They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
And our World will do the Time Warp again.
...I'm sorry.
Ain't your fault -- Here's the problem.
Shell-shocked!
I think it's closed.
I think mebbe we're early or somethin' --
Ohh!
Yes, I do.
You sure?
Why?
I'll call your brother.
It's only temporary.
It's not that --
It's okay.
No, I don't belong here.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
They're all the same.
The glasses... Please.
Do me another favor?
...What?
Don't tease me.
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
I'll be waiting.
Sharp -- Real nice.
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
No... Sharp -- You look great.
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
I gotta go out for a while.
...What?
Apollo?
Yeah, I can't beat him.
...I dunno.
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
Why?
Christ.
You didn't!
That so.
Get outta my life both of ya's.
What?!
Give my main man a raise!!
...I don't feel heat from the name.
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
Get that doctor.
No doctor!
You're hurtin', man!
No doctor!... I'm feelin' good, bro!
One more round.
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
No, man, it's very smart.
Fouls.
...Still don't feel no heat.
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
Very high an' very fast.
Of wa?
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
Does that bum have to say that?
Don't like yours neither.
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
No wine.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
Why?
Hey, give Rocky a dime.
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face!
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
...Ten minutes.
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.
How 'bout some Cokes?
Cost ya a buck.
This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.
Charge it.
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
Please, I need my hands to work -- Christ, don't bust my thumbs.
Bob.
That's it, I'm broke.
That's it? -- Completely?
That's it.
What about for food an' stuff?
You have my food in ya hand.
You think I don't hear things?
Paulie's sister.
Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
Do I have to pay juice?
Rocky, would you be interested in --
Excuse me.
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
What'd you say?
...Screw you, yoyo.
What?
Stuff it, man!
I like yella teeth.
I won't.
What was I gonna say?
'Night, Marie.
...What?
I said, how ya feelin'?
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
...What?
How old?
Come July, twenty-five.
More like thirty.
Yeah --
Did ya win?
Spider Rice.
Rice is a bum.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
Think about it.
Yeah, sure.
Message -- What message?
Here's the card?
When was they here?
'Bout an hour ago.
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
...I said that before.
Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
What's happened is freak luck.
Freak luck for sure.
Turtles -- domestic turtles.
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
Ya got heart.
Heart, but I ain't got no Tocker.
...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
Please, kid.
Check the eyes, Ben.
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
Whatta you get outta this?
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.
Real good.
See how fast he is -- damn!
Damn! How's it look?
Fine... That guy's great.
Would you keep goin'?
...Yeah.
Great, kid, great.
Yo, can I have my locker back?
It ain't your locker no more.
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
'Bout what?
He ain't losin' nothin'.
Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes!
Inventin' jokes ain't easy.
Ain't had time to check 'em.
What?
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
Hey --
Ya always in a bad mood --
...Adrian ain't sharp.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
Maybe another job is the best thing.
Yeah, sure -- She's very excited.
Ice skate.
I didn't want no turkey anyway.
He's takin' cheap shots.
It don't bother me none.
I'll do okay.
Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
...Tight.
...No.
Ain't sure, what's the story?
What?
The story -- what's happenin'?
Sure I like her.
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
What gaps?
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
To see ya train.
...It's cold outside, Paulie.
What can I do about it?
How're you preparing for this Bicentennial bout?
Do you feel you have a chance?
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.
Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!
You serve martinis, doncha?
So what's your next move, Valiant?
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
Shoulda guessed.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
A tweeting bird?
Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
R.K. Maroon.
What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
Bastards put him on notice.
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
Got me.  But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.
Sounds like singin'.
Oh, no...
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
Surprised?
That's right, me.
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
Toon cops worked me over.
Does it hurt?
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know who I could trust.
We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
Eddie, come on.
Wait here...
Doom.
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
So's the job.
Aren't you the lucky one...
As soon as is humanly possible.
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
Have you got the will?
Maybe.  Why?
That was the idea.
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
You tricked me, damn you!
Take it easy.
Aah!
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
Don't ever forget that.
Yeah, that's better.
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
I think you want a drink.  How about it, Judge?
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
My brother.  Get inside.
We can't do anything till it's dark.
Me.
Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
Get away from there.
No, it's not.
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
I rest my case.
... I'd head for Cucamonga.
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
From this box here...
I do bite my thumb, sir!
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
Uh? Uh?
Leave Me!
Then I'll leave thee.
Tempt not a desperate man!
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Romeo will answer it?
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
By my heel, I care not.
Is the day so young?
But new struck cuz.
Good heart, at what?
Farewell, my cuz.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
But 'tis no wit to go.
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
'Tis he.
He shall be endured
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter now. We must entreat the time alone.
God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
Where is my Lady's lord?
Romeo, come forth.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
Romeo, I drink to thee.
Madam, I am here. What is your will?
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
What?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
Well, what was yours?
That dreamers often lie.
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
A most courteous exposition.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Right.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
NO! Mercutio!
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
You know it is.
What?
Is that right?
Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
And I don't believe you...
That's why you were riding with him.
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
Not to me, you know that.
I thought I did.
That's him.
You lose them!
Not yet...
No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
You were a soldier, were you?
Is that right?
That's right.
Duty calls?
Just business.
Don't even think that I'm buying that.
Bloody fucking hell...
Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
I'd stake my reputation.
Ready when you are...
Shut up!
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
You first, Edvard.
I think not.  After you...
Not so fast.  Who's that?
He's company.
Bad company...
What do you mean?
There's been a slight problem.
What's that?
In here...
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
You'll die if you leave here.
You've told me a lot of things, boyo...
What's a little hate between business partners?
I swear...
Then where is it?
I sent it to myself in Paris.
Sent it where?
A post office box.
It's done.
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
Then I guess we're set.
What's that?
Don't cross me...
Nobody's going to do that!
Really?
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
Of course.  Don't you?
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Then if you don't mind...  I'm gonna pass out.
You should really let a doctor look at that.
I didn't expect that he would.
Call it a reckoning of character.
Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.
Gets the job done.
Long enough to shoot back.
Is that right?
It's been known to happen.
Why don't you go do better, then...
My way is better.
I got a surprise for you, blondie...
Who's they?
Everybody.
Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
Eat shit and die slowly...
You should learn a little patience.
Is that right?
Who else would you be?
I know cops -- and you're no cop.
I can do that.
That's what I thought.
As in, they own it?
Something like that...
I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
I asked if we could give him anything else.
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
See what?
Know what?
I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own.
A lot of people died.
I've seen a lot of people die before.
I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?
You don't.  You just learn to live with it.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
You don't have to do this.
Yes I do.
You see the bullet?
Clearly.
I know of him.
Yes.
If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
It is at that.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
You were behind the door?
Because I owe you.  Look at that...
You think?
I don't know...
Right now?
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Business keeps you on the road?
Something like that.
No you don't, and you know it.
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
I think not.
Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
Just like that?
Would you stop with that...
Why not?
Do you have a good answer?
No, I don't.
And now...
Finish it!
What?
You speak French.
What of it?
Nothing...
You better get some sleep, alright?
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
Gone.  Destroyed.
I guess that's for the best.
You sure?
I'm sure.
It's the Irish tape we want.
Gonna be tough.
Why didn't you kill him?
You put everything on the line because you...
You slept with the fucker!!
I'm alright.  And you?
Doing well.  This is?
I might know where you could get a copy.
All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.
The Russian would be easier.
I can't get enough of it.
Don't lie to me!!!!
Sure thing, and --
The horniest dog in Nevada.
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
Oh, you would have done great.
They're out of towners... Arizona plates...
What do you mean what are we going to do?
I mean -- Earl grabs Booth's arm --
Why?  Are you kidding me?
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
Hell, it won't be us!
Why?
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
Because...I know.
At the expense of six people.
Torch it?!
What's that?
What are you gonna do?
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
That's not what I mean.
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
No we didn't.  He died on his own.
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
Okay then.  I'll do it.
Exactly.  This is our little secret, partner.
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
No.
Neither do I.
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
It's gonna be o.k.
Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
You don't know if he was really gonna --
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
Do you have everything?
I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
No we're not.
That's right.
Then Sally comes too.
He killed her...he killed her...
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
He killed her...
It's NOT too late!
And you're solid on that?
Rock solid.
Why don't you get to the point.
My point, well...
By Friday.
I want my share. All of it.
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
HELLLLLP!!!!
Hello.
Because someone may have gotten away.
Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
Denning was wearing a bug.
No.  But he would, probably.
I might have to look into that...
Hi.
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
OK.
Yeah I'm fine.
I love you too.
You deserve it is the occasion.
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
I know.
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
I love you Sally.
I love you.
Well I was just throwing out ideas...
Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
I swear to you, it's true...
You know I do.
What did he buy?
A week ago, at most.
Thanks for your time.
Yeah.
I have a better plan.
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
This just might be our ticket!
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
Dwayne.
Did you say After Midnight?
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Hi.
Well I just uh, you know...
Well I don't know...
Have I seen her?
Shopping here?
C?
Yeah I'd say C...C.
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Yeah whaddya want?.
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
So be here at three.
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
I don't know...
What?
I can't hear a word you're saying!
That hasn't stopped you before.
I didn't say that.  You did.
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
Yeah let's hear about your day.
Dwayne put the gun down --
Shut up!!!  Slut!!!
Dwayne -
You'd do this to me!
Calm down --
Right behind you.
Well you're not getting, either.
Listen -
I was on a roll!  Im a little overextended now.
I think I am.
Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
Hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
Is that the mail?
Yeah.
Well, same ol' same ol'.
Are you hungry?
You've done without it long enough, ma.
Money.
Not in the trunk.
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
You think he skipped town?
We're going to find out.
I'm not getting an answer.
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
How much is that?
Two-hundred thousand!
The band has been playing over an hour.
How'd you know?
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
They think I'm a crooked customs agent.
I said get on your feet!
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.
That's right.
You bring American money?
No.  It's my first time.
You pick any girl for you and your friend.
Oh yes, she's very nice.
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
I said that?  Which word was "goat?"
I knew you were lying.
Try to land on your feet.
I'm sorry.
How you doin'?
Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
Who died?
You.
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
Who?
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
No.  She's a school teacher.
Forget it.
IT IS CRAZY!
I know.  I know.  I am sorry.
You said --
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
He'll be back soon.
How do you know?
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
Excuse me?
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
What did you say?
Nothing.  I said nothing.
Gimme the binoculars.
No.  It's not right.
Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
I don't want to hear this.
She's walking back towards the door.
It's your turn!
I don't need a turn!
There's people up here!
Get it out of here!
It's a bomb.
Snoopy is about six inches taller than you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a chance.
It doesn't matter.
Fine by me.
How was the sex?
What about a little king pao chicken?
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
Steamed dumplings?
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
Who's Benjamin?
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
Now that I believe.
End of the line.
You've been a good friend, James Carter.
Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
Follow me my Asian brother.
Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
Wait here.  I'll handle this.
I'll give it my best shot.
MMMMMM!!!!
No you didn't!
Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
What?!?!
Just GO!
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
You take care of yourself, Lee.
It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
It's okay, I got lots more.
First class.
The Plaza Hotel?
A little Mu-shu.
Some Kung-Pao?
Amen to that, brother.
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
Excuse me?
I need your help.
I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.
Look over there.  That's the eye in the sky room.
If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
I'm fine.
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
I still have my lunch money from third grade.
I'll take him.
There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor...
No.  He will report to me.  Do we understand each other?
Put a diaper on him, Chin.  I want to talk to the great Inspector Lee.
That's some serious poundage in dollars.
OK. Say what it is.
This is pathetic.
So was I.
No.
A little.
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
We are both full of shit.
What?
I was being polite.
Witnesses.
Right....
I know a shortcut.
Shortcut?
What plate?
The license!  You get it?!
No.
Did you make the plate?!
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
He was trying to kill me, not you.
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my ass again.
No. I just made it up.
What?
Come on!
Took off. Yes. They took off.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
Yes, I know this song.
You know War?
Yes, I think so.
No, fish is a PM food.
Excuse me?
Going into the restaurant.
This concrete?  This is still America.
What do you hear?
What?
The art.
You know him?
Oh, I think you like this very much.
Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.
Where'd you get it?
Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
What's wrong with that?
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.
Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?
It's called a dress.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
Yeah. So why you look do down?
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
At this point we don't have much.
How much they want?
Interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte.
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
Carter, shut up!
That's what you were supposed to be!
You a cop or something?
Or somethin'.
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
I'm waitin' here for a name.
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
Ambassador Han.
Yes.
She's fine.
Can I speak with her?
Han?
Yes.
It's Griffin.
Griffin?  Where are you.
I do.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
Don't worry, he's with Carter.
Ike just came by to check out the team.
You bet ya, Coach.
Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
Thank you.
Maintain eye contact.
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
It happens to be how I feel.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
It's hurting.
We'll rub.
He's here!... He's here!
"Make the shot."
"Nothing but net."
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
What?
Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Poor Ike.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
All the gory details.
Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
Yeah.
Then come for dinner.
Okay, we'll order out.
Then you'll be my best man.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
Why do YOU think she ran?
Oh, please!
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
I know.  Tell me something.  Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
Looking for Maggie.
No, she's talking about your hair.
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
Bye, Betty.  Thanks.
Oh, come on.  You're practically family.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
Excellent.
We'll see.
Twice...
Really?
Without oxygen...
We think so.
How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
Seven-fifty.
Five hundred.
Six-fifty.
Done.
You afraid to try?
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
Still sweet.
So?  Is that what you said to her?
You don't know.
No.
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
Of course.
No.  You take it.
Can you fix it?
Missed me bad, huh?
Well, they should.  Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
I already explained about that.
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
A little longer for me.
Really?
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
I love you, too.
Well, you do have the dress.
And the church.
So am I.
So, we'll...
Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
Yup!
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
Why?
Lighten up, what?
I'm just finishing up, too.
No, I'm just going to head home.
Good boy, Port Hole.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
Thank you, Dad.
No.  It's my life.
A harmless joke.
No, you tell her.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
Nope.
I hate boats.
It sounds nice.
But it's on the water.
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
Am I what they had in mind?
They're going to love you.
My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
Nope.  Not even when I was young.
Happy New Year.
We'll stay at the Plaza --
Go for a walk in Central Park --
Go to the Symphony --
It's delicious, trust me.
Does it have wheat in it?
I don't think so.
And then I'll see you in New York --
About forever.
No.
I do.
It's just like my grandmother's china.
Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
I told you.  Nothing --
At the top of the Empire State Building --
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
I think that's what I'm saying.
What?
Look!
About what?
Whatever it is.
What was what?
Nothing's with me.
Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
Can too.
Yes.
Listen to this, I love this part --
I know.
Turn on your radio!
What?
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
Becky?
What?
Is this crazy?
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
Thank you.  I love you.
I love you, too.
Good night.
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
But he saw you, right?
He said hello.
I saw her.  She looked just like this --
So I mailed your letter.
Made for each other.
No, I'm not. 
No, I know that part --
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
I know.
I want my money.
Go home for the weekend.
Yes.
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
Howard.
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
Are his folks nice?
You know.
What?
Magic.  It was magic.
Magic.
You don't believe in signs.
Sure you do --
Hello.
It's me?
The cabinets have to be redone --
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake --
It's been about a year and a half.
Have you had any relationship since?
And I don't want to invade your privacy --
I don't think I could really describe it.
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
She died.
Yeah.
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
Right, right.
You'll find out.
What is it?
You'll see.
H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
You think so?
It's Y. O. H.
Yeah.  What's that?
Your only hope.
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
But how am I going to get there?
I don't know.  Do I?
What is it?
We desperately need a spice rack.  Desperately.
It's never happening again. Right?
Right.
My feelings exactly.
What?!
You're right.  You better hope so.
Oh, you're changing your mind --
No, I'm not, but --
What?
So I can go.
Sure.  Looking good.
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
I think I know how to have a spice rack.
Stressed.
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
Somewhere in the middle.
I'm starting to notice that.
Go to sleep.
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
How do you know?
What was?
Is that what she used to sing?
Like do you believe in heaven?
Sleepless and Son.  Baltimore.
Now I'm late.  Bye.
Not now, Jonah --
It's a sign.
Oh, right.
She's going to cook something for us?
It's only ten o'clock.
Jonah!
Okay.
Thank Victoria for dinner.
I'm glad you liked it.  Good night, Jonah.
I thought I saw a black widow spider.
I was thirsty.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
That's true.  Why is that?
Everyone at work heard you.
I just called for a second.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
It's a short word.
Victoria? She's okay.
The one who wrote us.
It might be in the kitchen.
Yes.
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
Shut up.
You said we could go to New York.
Did too.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
No.
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
If I didn't go.
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
It was all they had.
What about it?
Do you like it?
Hi.  Sam?
Yes?
You must be Jonah.
I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.
What do you mean?
You look good yourself.
He's good at it.
I read an article about this ...
I read the same article...
It takes time --
Your foreman says that's a foreman's job.
No thanks.
How's it going?
You want 'em all arrested?
I don't make policy.
I say we gotta take action. Now.
You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
It never ends.
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
So much the better.
An American.
No, Estellita.
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
They are singing for me.
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
Yes. We will light the candles.
Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
Got to talk to the brothers.
I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
What has it got me, your union?
If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
Aaah, what's the use?
Antonio paid for it.
It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
He'll have it good. Some day.
They say I am no good to you.
You are no good to me -- in jail.
Over my dead body.
She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
Can be what?
Sure.
Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
Four nights. How did you sleep?
We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
You weren't waiting for me.
Hunting.
When?
Sun up.
Alone?
No.
Ramn -- you can't.
Why not? I'm not needed here.
No. New York.
It's possible. Just negotiate.
Forgot what?
It's Mama's Saint's Day.
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
You've got to help around the house!
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
Ramn ... listen to me ... I'm in a	jam ... I had to get a job ...
Ramn -- listen my kids ...
T! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
My kids don't have enough to eat!
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
Are you Australian?
No.
Good. I fucking hate Australians.
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
Shhh.
The spiders.
Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ... 
No, Why?
Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
You like that?
First rate, ain't it?
It's downright classy is what it is.
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
Everything go?
Yeah.
I'll see you tonight.
I was thinking Alice Cooper.
Leave me out of this.
That bad, huh?
Go ahead.
I can't.
Why not?
You get off on abuse or something?
That's long enough to get out of town.
What happened to your eye?
How far out of town?
Trust me. We're safe.
Never heard of him.
It's the only way to play.
I try.
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
It gets me through the day.
You really need to lighten up.
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
How much time do you have?
What is wrong with you?
How much time do you have?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
You don't like the tune, find another station.
What are you hiding, Danny?
Therapy session is over.
No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
It's me.
I'm kind of busy.
Please open the door, Danny.
You can still work.
He knows where I work.
Find a new job.
I been that way ever since.
I just can't. Okay?
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
Danny, it's not what you think.
I don't want to leave you.
Your daughter needs you.  Go.
What?
It's Tom.
Guess it's our turn.
Twelve
Midnight?
I know a guy.
Lead the way.
Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
My features. They're Finnish.
You don't say.
Finland is a country.
Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
I know a buyer.  Guy's looking for a quarter's worth.
Can your man handle that?
Sure.
Not tonight.
Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
I think on account of his nose.
You're going to have to explain that one.
He doesn't have one.
No  You think she's a tweaker?
No. I'm good.
Sure, Jimmy.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Was he the president?
Yes, Jimmy
Yes, Jimmy.
Thanks for not laughing at me.
When? When did you ever see me use?
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
I can't tell you.
You don't trust me?
I don't trust anybody.
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
The good stuff.  Can you handle that?
No, I'm good.
Secret recipe.
Make me an offer.
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
Hey, okay.
Anything for a dear friend.
If you say so.
Why do you say that?
Pull your pants down.
I'm sorry?
Pull your motherfucking pants down.
Big Bill.
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
Uh-uh-uh ...
Okay! Okay!
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
Yeah, dickhead.
You go, boy.
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
It's not my place.
Don't you wonder why I do it?
Tell me what?
Question is, what are you doing here?
I was trying to score some dope.
Cut the shit, Flynne.
Bubba.
After that ass-whipping you gave me?
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
Whata you mean?  He told me -
Who is it?
I thought you'd be happy.
Yeah.
My name is Tom.
Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ...  You're in the bathroom.  You've been shot in the shoulder ...
Answer the fucking question!
It speaks!
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
Turns out he's connected.
To who?
The Mexicali Boys
What?!
Who the hell is Jimmy?
He's the only one I told.
What'd you do, piss your pants?
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
They have. But they never found a lab.
What if he caps me before you can make a move?
You mean the menacing red car?
Worse. Much worse.  A teacher.
I was talking about Miles.
And you've got wiener breath.
Really?
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
You mean like the Donner Party?
What do you mean?
Look at that place. It's creepy.
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
Just admit you're wrong.
Why are you doing this?
Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
Don't we always take good care of you?
Maybe he isn't showing.
Better than drugs.
Don't worry about it.
No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
I thought you were done.
...alright, let me know when.
Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
Where are your men now?
Thank you, sir.
You writin' a book or somethin'?
As a matter of fact, I am.
Yep.
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
You take account of the wind?
The hell he didn't.
Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
Of course, sir.
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?
Nope, he ain't Wade.
Like hell, you did.
What deal?
I'd love to hear it.
My guess, too.
Gives Wade the second shot.
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
It's worth it.
To each, his own.
It was nothing.
Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
Pass.
Sarge?
You think the rest of us were?
Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
I heard.
It seemed appropriate.
You know classical music?
Some.
Where are you from, Captain?
Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
A machine gun.
Plenty.
Same place we are.
You don't count.
Sure, you got one?
I changed my mind.
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
Simpson.
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
Fresh out.
I've got a line on one.
Yep, hell of a mission.
PUSH!
Uh, Captain...
Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
Since when have things been normal?
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
You never know.
It doesn't take this.
How about I go right, sir?
How about you take your position?
About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before.
Let's just find someplace.
You want me to take over?
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
I'm listening, sir.
Well, I, for one, like cheese.
Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
Easy for you to say, sir.  Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring his fucking neck.
Well now I'm saying we're moving out.  Get off your ass.
That's a mystery to me.
Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
What if our guys open up, sir?
OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN.
Get back to your positions!
I coach the baseball team, too.
That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.
Knows what that means.  He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.
Alright, come with me.
Yes, sir.
Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS.
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things.
Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine.
Lingerie.
Yeah?  So?
What are we likely to run into?
Captain, he's fast!
Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother?
Get lost.
He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Who knows?  It worked.
Twenty-four-five.
How can you, how can you say that?
No, no he's not.
Speak with my lawyer.
So you refuse to answer my questions?
Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
And your former wife.
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
For going to school?
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Good for her.
I'll take the whole set.
Excellent.
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
Hey, sis.
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
I still am.
He's a mess!
I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
What's a scam?
Going out as friends.
I'm gonna call her.
Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.
Lloyd, give it up.
C'mon, just do it.
C'mon Lloyd.
That's just so embarrassing.
Please? COREY Alright. Alright, Okay, here.
Yes.
See you.  Bye.  Bye Diane.
I admit nothing.
Read it.
I am.
If she wants me, she can come to me.
Come on, it's graduation.
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
Meaning?
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it.
What is wrong with this girl?
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
I can put that together.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
I'll put this past my boss
I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
You like it?
Oh yeah!
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
I love you dad.
I love you too honey.
Tell me, is it bad news?
No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
Okay, I give up.
Dad, I'm sorry.
You should be.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
You're not listening to me.
I like him a lot.
Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
Just finishing up in here.
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
Swear to god.
I swear to god.
But I found the money.
Honey, it's not what you think.
What am I supposed to think?
Honey, about what?
I made their lives better.
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
Hi.
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
Look at those eyes.
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Yeah.  What a day.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
Busy?
Are you busy on Friday?
Yeah, I have to help my father.
Are you busy on Saturday?
Pardon me?
I'll go.
Eight. Eight O' clock.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
No.
Yeah.
It's the worst job since keymaster.
Bye.
Nobody knew me before tonight.
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
Yeah.  I'm so glad we did this.
You know what?
What?
So what's your job this summer?
No, I'm serious.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Then call me tomorrow.
Today is tomorrow.
Then call me later.
Yeah?
You think so?
Mmmm.
Come on.
Okay, bye, I will.
Okay, bye.
I'll see you there.  Bye.
Okay.
What did you say?
Well... just meet her.
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
Yeah.  With potential.
Friends with potential.
Am I wrecking my car?
Yes.  Are you shaking?
You're shaking.
I don't think so.
You're cold.
Then why are you shaking?
I don't know.  I'm happy.
It did?
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
How do you know what I'm going to say?
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
Well, I need to study, and...
You need to study?
Okay.  It's good knowing this.
We decided...
It sounded like you did.
Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
Is this because of your dad?
Did you talk to Corey?
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
Just my dad.
You told your dad?
Oh shit.
I'm sorry.
What do you want?
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
What?
I love you.  Please, I love you.
No.  You just described every great success story.  Alright, it's alright.
You've gotta get her out of your head, man.
Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
Uh... okay... um...
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
The guy with the Datsun?
No.
The truck?
Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
How ya doing?  Is she around?
Yeah.  Honey?
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
I'm totally and completely serious.
No, really.
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
She's very successful.
I know
Very talented.
I know this part, keep reading.
Your car?
Dude, I can't do it!
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
Lloyd.
What?
Hey.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
How you doin', brother?
I don't really know where we are.
A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
Diane, everybody loves that you showed up.
I love you too.
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
We're full on bonded.
Yeah, alright.
Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
He is.
Sir, the list is correct.
Oskar, please -
What -
A charade?  How could it be a charade?
War.
It's a beautiful city.
It's up to you.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
In Breslau.
Good.
They're mine!
Yeah, what's that?
I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
These people, my people, I want my people.
You did, but you didn't.
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
This is not my problem.
Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
God bless you, sir.
Yeah, okay.
There's nothing in the stores.
Yeah.
Things are great, things are great.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
It kind of looks that way.
Something they can hold in their hands.
Better this month than last?
Yes.
Ah, yes.
It's dangerous.  It's dangerous, to me, personally.
I think it's too late.
More.
Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
Yes.
Stern.
They arrived, can you believe it?
You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
No, no, what, what is it?
You did so much.
No.
He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
Take the neighborhood.
The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
They've broken their pattern.
Don't. Think Bailey.
Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
What is it?
I heard a noise.
Where?
That's smart.
What? I can't hear you...
Hang up...call...
I'm losing you.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
Cici. Who's this?
Someone who wants to talk to you.
Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on.
What if I said goodbye?
Why would you wanna do that?
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
No, it's me.
I had to change. Did anyone call?
Just some asshole trying to scare me.
Can we talk?
I don't think that's a good idea.
You could start with an apology.
I did that.
It helped me realize one thing.
Not until youre dead.
And much richer as a result.
I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
Where is Sidney's father?
Home--where he lives.
Why don't you ask them?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
Finish what my son started.
But youll never get away with it.
Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
What's your subject?
I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
Where's Sid?
She dumped me.
No way.
Yeah.
You freakin?
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
Sid, you don't have to.
The forbidden subject.
I think it's out of your control.
No. This is a set up.
Thats quick.
Youre not going to get away with this.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
What guy?
Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
I got it..
He hates Oliver Stone.
I find his work overwrought.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
Or it found us.
Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to flip.
Tuitions expensive.
Miss Weathers.
I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
I never meant to imply...
Yeah?
Not good.
What are we looking for?
Can we turn the light on?
That's not the way it's done.
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
We'd break some furniture.
And Joel's pre-med.
Let's find out.
Over here.
He filmed his victims.
No, wait here.
There's nothing. I'm coming down.
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
Oh my God. How could it happen?
Humor me, Sid.
I'll give you one guess.
I don't play games.
What if your life depended on it?
You're pretty when you're angry.
I'm everywhere.
Stay away from the cop.
It's what you want from me.
Watch your back.
It's good to see you involved.
My morn was a Delta.
But who would operate your camera?
Oh my God.
Yes, goddammit!
Where is your attacker?
I dont know.
I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20.
I have to watch rehearsal.
Too bad.
Is Sid in therapy?
But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.
Hello?  Hello?
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
What about rehearsal?
Gotta.
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
I'd really just like to be alone.
It's not a good idea, Hallie.
I counted four.
Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
Easy black boy.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
Thanks, Joel.
But...
..it's really about family and tradition...
..harmonica style is okay.
I just love being a sister.
Gale?
She's not here right now.
But she's standing right next to you.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
Now.
I get scared really easy, okay.
You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
He's after me.
Where you going?
Don't panic.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
Hello.
Who is this?
Asshole, Can't talk.
But your voice sounds so familiar.
What kind of a game?
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
Good bye Ben.
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
Closer than you think.
Reaction to what?
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
There's more.
Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
Absolutely.
You mean like, movie trilogies?
You seem to like movies, Detective.
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
To me Hollywood is about death.
Excuse me?
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
Is that a threat?
The killer called her.
What?  When?
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
No.
No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife.  These two lethal weapons.
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Sid I can see you!
Where are you Dewey?
He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
You used to say that was our strength.
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
Always.
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Gale, your engine's still running.
Fuck!
Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
What?
GALE BEHIND YOU!
Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Just Jennifer.  And you.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
Oh shit it's my cell!
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
Need to get in that building?
No really?
There a story in that building?
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Good twist.
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
Just because you knew her?
Yeah.
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
I know! He killed Kincaid!
Let's get out of here!
GALE WATCHOUT!
Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at your   music video awards.
Page 22, Candy's big moment.
Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
Who's this?
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
I'm hanging up right now.
It's Sarah.
Roman that's not the line.
It is in my script.
My movie.
I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
W-what do you want?
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
Go there.
Are you sure?
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
No I need to call you. Just you.
I'm sorry, your voice.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
Sorry.
No one's saying you did.
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
You know it.
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
Yeah...
She looked dead. Still does.
Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
Where the fuck did she go?
Yes, sir.
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
What are you doing here?
You sleep in THAT?
What are you doing here?
He's here. He's trying to kill me...
Hey, hey, it's just me.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
It's okay. We need to talk.
Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
What?
Are you serious?
Yeah... I think so.
What?
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
It's okay. Give me the gun.
Stop it!
Who is this?
Who are you trying to reach?
What number is this?
What number are you trying to reach?
I don't know.
I think you have the wrong number.
It happens. Take it easy.
So why did you dial it again?
You're forgiven. Bye now.
Wait, wait, don't hang up.
What's that noise?
You're making popcorn?
Uh-huh.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Just some scary movie.
Do you like scary movies?
Uh-huh.
You have to have a favorite.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
So, you gotta boyfriend?
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
I want to now who I'm talking to.
That's not what you said.
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Nah, I don't think so...
Gotta go.
Don't...
To talk.
Dial someone else, okay?
You getting scared?
No-bored.
More of a game, really.
They'd never make it in time.
So you better leave.
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
Guess.
That all depends on you.
Why are you doing this?
No...
Then he dies. Right now.
Which is it?
Turn off the light.
Come on. It'll be fun.
No... please.
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
Don't do this. I can't...
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
No...
Come on, yes you do.
Please..stop...
I can't think.
YES!
NOOOO....
Please go away! Leave us alone!
Then answer the question. Same category.
No it's not. It was Jason.
Afraid not.
Answer the question and I will.
What?
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
He's not a suspect, is he?
We haven't ruled out that possibil...
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
Deputy... good evening.
What brings you out to these parts?
You never know when or where a story will break.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
Mind if I join you?
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
Can I bring Kenny?
I don't think you're so bad.
Sidney's father?
I'll get my camera.
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene.
Yes, you doofus.
Hold up a sec...
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
You're sure it was the Hilton?
At the airport.
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
Afraid not.
Should I be worried?
Not yet.
How is everything?
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
He's her boyfriend.
What were you doing out here?
Drive by patrol.
How is she?
She's tough.
We haven't located her Dad yet.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
What is it? Where's Casey?
Casey? Casey?
Call the police.
Not my daughter... not my...
Jesus! The camera-hurry!
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
About thirty seconds.
It'll be out later this year.
I'll send you a copy.
Just stay back.
I want to talk to you.
Kenny. Camera. Now.
Forget it.
Many times.
Has his story changed?
For attention. The girl has some serious issues.
Ricki Lake.
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
So who are you?
Your front porch.
Right here.
Uh-huh.
What am I doing?
If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
Hello Sidney.
I heard screaming.
No you didn't.
...so call if you need me.
Got it.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Twice.
Don't shoot. It's me.
Don't come any closer.
Before she dumped him for Steve.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
It would certainly improve your high school Q.
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
We had a run in the mass murder section.
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.
I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
He came to make up.
There goes my chance with Sid.
Like you had one.
Yeah.
I'll be right back.
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
Why are you doing this?
It's all part of the game.
The official term is "psychotic".
What happened?
How do you gut someone?
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
Later.
It's past seven.
Bye.
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
Just like old times, ain't it?
No, nothing's like it used to be.
He was there, Tatum.
It's alright. I'll get it.
I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
I bet he's pissed.
It was him, Tatum. I know it.
Come on. Pathos has it's perks.
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
Come on, let's rock.
I don't know, they just did.
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
I did. He's full of shit.
Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?
How's that?
He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
I'm in.
So what?  This victim...
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
No, I haven't heard.
There was a second.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
Good.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
You know.
Really?
I read about it in the paper.
What?  What?
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
What the hell's going on?
Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
Hello.
It's not too far away now.
Why?
Her pretty head.
NO!
You'll see.
Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
A woman...
Murderers like you?
You should be thanking me.
And, why is that?
It's close.
What the fuck is going on?
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
I realize that.
For now.
No one yet.
What?
Is there any blood in it?
I don't know.  Feel free to look for yourself, okay?
Guessing at this point is useless.
What?
Tonight.
What about them?
I read.  Remember reading?
I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
This is just to satisfy my curiosity.  I'm still leaving town Saturday.
We put her in a safe house.
Did you read them?
Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
Nothing.
Totally unrelated victims.
I know.
Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
It's got to be.
A switchblade.
We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
Bear with me.
I wish I still thought like you.
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
You tell me.  I'm new in town.
Call an ambulance.
No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
He'll string us along all the way if we're not careful.
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
Oh, it's alright.
Who pays the rent on time.
This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
Yes we do.  Here...
I don't know... like fifty.
Let's go.
I don't.  Neither do you.
We're focusing.
The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.
It's not what you think it is.
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
Saint Thomas Aquinas.  He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
That's what it says.  Jonathan Doe.
This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.
We'll take a look at him.  Talk to him.
Who told you about my silver tongue?  You been talking to my wife?
I'm fine.
What happened?
It was him.
You can't go in there.
We have probable cause now.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Think about how we got here!
No point in arguing anymore...
We had him.
I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
How can you say that?  Especially after today?
Where's the victory?
No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
When do we get to question him?
Kiss me on the lips.
Wait!
What are you talking about?  What happened?
What did you say?
Don't do this... please...
Put the gun down, Somerset!
I don't see anything.
I can't do this now... please.
What?
No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.
It surprises me.  It really does.
Too long.  What do you think so far?
I don't sleep very well.
I don't know...
This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
I don't know.
How should I know?
But Mose Harper said...
It just happened to be me...No need to make any more of it...
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
Why don't you finish the job?
It was, I tell you!
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
I ain't wearing no gun.
Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
Dunno...Seems so.
Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
Well, swear him out again!...I'll go with you.
Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
You fit a lot of descriptions.
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
...like a flower and is cut down... <U>Amen</U>!
By what you preach...none!
Just keep goin'...
How far's the river from here, Mose?
Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
I'm Clayton.
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
You lie! All white men lie...and kill...
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
Told ya, didn't I?
Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
Seven Fingers...ay-eh...Seven...
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
That's what I said.
You got it with you?
I beg your pardon?
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Leggo...
Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
Because she's my...my...
Whatchu doin'?...
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
Nine...  Ten!
What's the sense in it!
What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
Not likely.
I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
We won't be here...Come on!
You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
Not far from it...
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
Time's running out...But I'm obliged to you.
I got your boy killed.
Don't go blamin' yourself...
I've seen her...and she's alive.
That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
Ain't worth the mendin'...
Wouldn't bother me...  I wouldn't try it in front of pa, though, was I you...
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
You crazy?
We got two around that age...
Come on, say it.  You know...
"With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
What else should I do, damn it, he's dying!
Oh God, Tommi...
Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget...
It still worked in town.
I mean the armchair!
Oh, damnit!
In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
Do you have a better idea?
I'll do it myself.
You?
My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
Making our very own solstice fire.
I just had a really strange experience.
What?
So do I, believe me.
Someone from the village.
Yeah... I have to go to town.
No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
In the village.  Look what I found.
Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
What? What am I supposed to sense?
The house - Tommi - something just doesn't jive here...
I haven't the slightest idea.
Hi, darling.
We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
Does this dog here belong to you?
Do I look like it that much?
Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
I've killed my husband!
What?
Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
We should leave the past alone.
Yes, something was...
Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".
Very funny.
It's good.
The title won't do.
Ah
Thank you, Ned.
And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
Right you are, governor!
Sir Robert De Lesseps.
Lady?
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
You have the last act?
You have the money?
Tomorrow.
Twenty pounds on delivery
No Juliet?!
See you in jail.
What is the chief part?
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
The title?
It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
How much?
Ten pounds.
You're a liar.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
Nothing comes.
Most interesting.
Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?
A goodly length in times past, but lately
No, no. You have a wife, children
On my mother's side the Ardens
No, your marriage bed.
yet cannot love nor write it.
Who is that?
Take his feet out. Where will you get
Put his feet in.
It's a comedy.
Cut his nose off.
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
And his ears.
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
Good title.
There's never any
Of course not!
Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
Very well.
But nothing is happening.
it will be all right, madam.
What happened to Sam?
Who are you?
Thomas Kent!
Every word.
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
God be praised!  Locked?
As soon as I have found my muse
She is always Aphrodite.
Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
Fifty pounds? What for?
To my weekly confession.
To the Palace at Whitehall.
Is it about a pirate's daughter?
Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
What? Who?
Romeo.
No, it will turn out well.
How will it?
I don't know, it's a mystery.
What do we do now?
The show must  you know
Go on.
I don't know. It's a mystery.
Wonderful, wonderful.
Burbage says you have a play.
I have. And chinks to show for it.
Romeo isItalian. Always in and out of love.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
The daughter of his enemy.
The daughter of his enemy.
I thought your play was for Burbage.
This is a different one.
A different one you haven't written?
"Not having that which, having, makes them short."
"Of love?"
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
Will you ask Her Majesty to be patient?!
I will.
Be still.
I am not so well-born.
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
Stand up straight, girl.
What do you love so much?
Your Majesty
Above Lord Wessex?
I have lost my gift.
But your voice  Have they dropped?
Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam?
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
"Parting is such sweet sorrow"
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
"She speaks.
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
"The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine."
So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
But the plague
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
I have to get back.
Who is there?
Will Shakespeare!
The same, alas.
Oh but why "alas?"
A lowly player.
If they find you here they will kill you.
You can bring them with a word.
Oh, not for the world!
Can you love a player?
It is strange to me, too.
Even your play.
Oh
Well perhaps better than my first. 
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
It was the owl--come to bed
Mr. Henslowe?
Oh--no, no!
There is time. It is still dark.
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl.
I must. I must
Yes, some of it is speakable.
Oh, but it is mine too!
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
I know how to fight!
A literary feud. Quite normal.
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
How does it?
I don't know. It's a mystery
My lord.
I have spoken with your father.
So my lord? I speak with him every day.
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
It was your eyes. No, your lips.
The Queen has consented?
It is not my riding day, my lord.
I am going to church.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
My hat?
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
Let me see you. Take off your hat.
Do you understand me?
No, sir.
Of course you have not! I have not written it!
It is only ours you can know.
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
Are you bringing your laundry woman?
A man, my lord?
By God, I'll fight the lot of you
I don't know -- Campbell or something?
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
Just serve.
Will you shut up and play.
You're a bad loser.
I haven't lost yet.
Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
About what?
About this guy, this Hugo person.
I don't have time.
I'm only asking what you think.
Why, thank you, David.
Alex, I don't have the time --
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
Think about it.
No.
Come on, David.
Juliet?
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
When are you going to let the police know?
You call them if you want.
And what about you?
Dig the pit, I don't know.
No, not that.
Then what? Who's going to do what?
You know what I'm talking about.
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
You know what. Who's going to do it.
I don't hear this.
I won't be able to.
Take his legs.
But not quite.
Is that going to be deep enough?
Is this necessary?
Can we talk about something?
Not now. I have an idea.
I want to talk now.
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
I don't know.
How much did you pay?
I don't know.
How much?
I don't know.
Security.
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
There was a break-in.
Downstairs, I know. Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six.
I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
Oh, that'll come in useful.
You're sure? There's lots more.
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You're not eating.
Not eating what?
If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
Looking for you? Yes.
We just wanted to speak to you.
Your friends.
Where do you think you'll go?
Where will we go? Where will we go? Juliet?
Well?
But there's no --
Don't know what?
This is just an informal discussion.
What does it look like?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
No. Why should it?
Take another look at these two.
I don't know them.
What?
Parked outside?
That's all?
Sorry to waste your time.
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Just one thing.
Yes.
What?
Yes, thanks.
And you like it?
Oh, yes, it's great.
Cameron?
Yes.
Really?
Just serve.
Alex.
Not usually this drunk.
-- instead of what he is --
What I am.
-- which is --
-- which is a hack.
The man we know and love.
Yeah.
I think you're lying.
You're right.
No, Alex, we don't really love you.
No. Any idea which channel he's on?
So I gathered.
Maybe he didn't like us.
David?
His car's still there.
He's got a car?
So what's wrong with that?
What sort of car?
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
Open it.
Now?
Yes.
All right. No problem.
What? What's wrong?
What are you doing?
I'm just looking.
Don't.
No.
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
What?
Is that all?
I thought we all were.
I don't thinkI can.
And now you tell me.
David?
For ever and ever.
It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
Who?
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
That's not him.
Who was it?
No.
Then let's spend some money.
Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
You know we're right.
Don't you?
He can't stay up there.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
What are you doing here?
We have to talk.
Your painful groin?
David?
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
Oh, good.
We could put it somewhere.
Where he can't get it?
Now you thought of that, not me.
Forget it -- he'll come down.
Oh.
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
I refuse.
You're frightened.
I'll wait there.
What?
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
We were just sorting things out.
That's what I thought he said.
The perfect couple, I should say.
You mustn't take it so badly.
No.
I see.
What?
What?
You mean I can have the room?
Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
It's about the burglary.
Of course.
Can we come in?
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
There are only two other people in the flat.
Who said there were four?
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
You're sure of that.
Yes.
Do you smoke?
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
Would you like to talk about it?
Yes. They're my friends.
That was stressful. I found that stressful.
Two hundred pounds?
Two hundred pounds.
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
That's what it cost, David.
What?
No.
No one. I promise.
Who have you talked to?
No one.
If I think you're lying --
With a face like this?
I should hope so.
You and me?
And you need your sleep.
Here.
Right here?
In this firm.
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
Exactly what I was --
Not any real sneering as such, no.
But they sneer, don't they?
I'm not sure --
You get the job done.
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
Which is why I'm trusting you with this account.
What happened to that guy?
What guy?
That guy, the one that died.
That one, last week.
Oh, him. Well, he died.
That's what I thought.
You must be Juliet.
I'd be delighted.
A priest who dies.
I see.
It's a breeze.
All right.
Did he sound upset?
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
I'm a doctor.
And he's a patient of yours?
No. But he needs treatment.
For what?
A certain weakness.
The human condition.
You know about it?
I write about it?
And that's not the same thing?
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
Look again if you like.
I mean, that's what it's like.
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Is it real?
Or a fake?
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
Chicken salad, Devra!
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
I don't know, I think...
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
No, it's a very groovy girl.
Then what's the problem?
That kid... the hairdresser.
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
Lester, don't you think that uhh --
What do you expect me to do about it?
I just thought you'd like to know --
Yes, sweetheart, shh.
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?
That's okay too.
-- think what you have time to think, Lester.
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
Why not?
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
Yeah, I think so.
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
Gee, that's very serious...
I know.
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
It turned out to be cancer.
I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.
I don't want to see you anymore.
I'll be right back, baby, really.
I gotta talk to you.
I don't want to talk about it...
But you don't know what happened.
I don't care.
Nummers.
What?
I don't want to place you in any position --
-- to be put in that kind of position...
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
What kind of treatment?
Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts...
You're looking great, baby.
What're you doing later?
Whatever you say.
Your husband?
Yes.
I don't know. Just a minute...
I hope she's all right.
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
No, I know.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
I know.
That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.
Hello, George.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
Right now, I just don't care.
She's a friend of Jill's.
And who's Jill?
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
... what?...
That headboard.
Uh-uh.
Let it ring.
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
No.
Are you?
No.
Then it's not your problem.
It isn't?
I guess so.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
Hello.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
I do her hair, yeah.
Chopped liver?
Did you hear me?
Yeah.
Gee, this is great.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
See if you've been making it with my mother.
Have you ever made it with a girl?
I asked you first.
Am I what?
Making it with my mother?
Don't make conversation with me.
What?
No kidding.
Then what do you think?
That you're just like your mother.
I am not like my mother!
You are.
I am not!
You are.
Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?
Yeah.
How is she?
Great.
Wonderful woman.
She is.
And you need money?
Right, that's right.
Well, yeah... you know.
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Pardon me?
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
I mean credit references, Mr. Roundy.
Yeah.
Yes, Buffums.
I've got heads here, Norman.
You promised you'd do the show.
Oh fuck, Norman!
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
Great. Who's been doing your hair?
-- Yeah... your car down here?
Jill's really great, isn't she?
Great... so how's everything with you?
He's a very private person, actually.
You going to tell him?
-- What for? Honey, I'll see you later.
Well, I do.
Probably the bathroom.
I'd cut it...
You would?
Yeah, I think so...
You don't seem very sure.
No, I'm sure.
Great.
Yeah... I mean great.
What's wrong?
It's hot in here.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
The shrink? Many times.
Do you? You still see him?
Why not?
And what?
No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
What?
Did you?
You know what I'm talking about.
Hey, I don't tell.
One of my few virtues is discretion.
You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
You're a genius.
I don't want to... I swear...
I know... you don't know, I know.
Don't, don't, don't...
What are you talking about?
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
-- this guy with Jill.
He's a director.
Fuckin' A --
-- what?
You were great.
You don't think so? I do.
You were great.
I am you, you little bastard.
He still having parties?
He never stopped.
Am I entertaining you?
We're friends.
-- oh I thought you were --
-- what?
Nothing.
-- mmm --
-- ass and legs --
Look who's talking.
Me?
-- yes, you --
-- do you want ice?
-- we are?
-- you've got to leave.
Lester's on his way.
Please, we'll have to talk later --
Look about last night --
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
That's it, then I'm leaving.
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
It's too late...
I don't know... Jackie?
What?
I don't know -- I've got to.
-- Right after I sprayed her?
What?
Oh yeah?
Don't talk like a child. You're a pro, now get out there and cut!
Wash her.
What with?
-- Oh my yes.
-- Otis?
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
-- please, please forgive me...
-- you know better...
-- why did you come in today?
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
-- how did you get here?
-- took a bus.
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
-- yeah, this is --
-- yes, George.
Okay... thanks...
I have to see you.
Hey, stop by the shop.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
What're you talking about?
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
Where?
Here in the canyon.
I just... who what?
You said somebody... who?
Keep moving --
Now, George --
Nobody's gonna get you but me!
Fine. How are you?
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
You're different.
I am?
You're great.
I am?
Yeah.
Do you really mean that?
Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with you.
Why am I great?
We live together now.
Of course I like children.
You've never even been around one.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Okay...  Night, baby.
George?
What!
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Hello.
Hey, I'm, you know --
Could I?
Egypt!
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
Great... can we talk later?
I already said hello.
George.
When can I talk to you?
Whether or not I'm going.
Going where?
Egypt.
Your advice!
I want your feelings about it.
Right now?
When I get off work.
When is that?
I'll call you.
When is that, George?
I'll call you.
What?
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
... Okay...
Where's your car?
A friend dropped me off.
Never mind. Where've you been?
A business meeting, I told you that.
Look at the way I live.
Ha, ha.
Commercials.
-- well aren't you --
-- okay --  -- I'll see you later. Your house.
I do, Jill.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
Well that's something.
What is.
I'm very tired, George.
Let go of me.
Yes.
Where did this come from?
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
How many?
What do you wanna know for?
What difference does it make?
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
-- no, it'll help me, really --
How?
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
Does it make you happy?
That's all you've got to say?
Did you?
Please!... that's not like you.
George, now cut this out.
Stop it.
Did you?
Yes, yes, I did.
What did you say?
George...
What did you say?
I said you were a loser!
-- A wash and set.
No.
No?
You need a cut.
But Mr. Norman said --
Said what!
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
Thank you.
Yes it is.
But what?
When?
What about, tonight?
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
I know it, I know it.
... this doing hair it's...
Son, we'll do business, I can tell you that.
Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
Well... who are those guys?
What do they look like?...
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
Godammit, George...
Sit down.
But...
I said sit down!
Oh Jesus Christ.
What can I say!
Did they have something against me?
Didn't they tell you?
I wanna hear it from you!
Why, why do you think that is?
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
Well, I don't know.
No thanks.
Okay, thanks.
I'll have to wash one out.
What about her?
I mean, how did that happen?
Lester, it just happened.
She's nothing but a whore.
No --
Yes I do.
I'm finished with her.
Wasn't sure it was you.
All right, who're you with? Jill?

No.
Awww --
I'll call you back.
Come on by.
I'll call you back...

Okay, okay...
I'm coming over.
I'll call you back.
No you won't.

A daytime soap opera.
And?
I was too old.
What was it, somebody's daughter?
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
Yes.
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
Is that right?
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
Is that right?
No kidding? Your own shop?
Who were you talking to?
Who do you think I was talking to?
My secretary saw you with that boy.
That's not very logical, Lester.
What's that?
You're still jealous.
They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
Why not?
Because I don't want one.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Glad to meet you, Jill, Mr. Pope.
Jesus, she's my best friend.
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying -- George --
You know what's wrong.
Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
Jackie, what're you doing?
I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
Oh yeah?
I'll call you.
Fine.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
So what's your point?
I know, I'm sorry.
You're really a love -- you sure?
-- No. No really.
Well, what is it, honey?
Nothing.
It must be something.
Well, it's George.
But you have problems?
-- Yeah, honey...
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
How much?
Jackie --
What?
It's been so long I don't how long?
Honey?
What?
-- He reached up and tore them.
What did you do?
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
That's right.
But why Egypt?
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
Sure.
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
Well he's not exactly a friend.
Is he an enemy?
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
-- never mind.
Good for you.
He's a hairdresser.
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
I don't think so.
Well did he go in there with Jackie?
George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
You mean when are you going to Egypt?
Two weeks from tomorrow.
You're going?
You're going.
I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
-- there's not much room --
Jill.
Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
Thank you.
-- just wonderful.
No... how long did you say?
Three weeks.
Do you have children?
No.
Are you married?
No.
John...
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
Thanks for coming by.
Everybody but us.
-- we're going to be here all night.
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
Yes?
I'm hungry.
What was the Donner party?
They had to, in order to survive.
Okay.
Yes, Dad.
Yes.
Do you feel bad?
Then why don't you go to sleep?
I can't.  I have too much to do.
Yes?
Do you like this hotel?
What?
Are you sure?
Yes, Dad.
Good.
French Fries and Ketchup.
I'm not supposed to.
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Who's Tony?
Is Tony the one that tells you things?
Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
Try to think what it was.
Room 237?
You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Yeah, I know.  It always takes a little time to make new friends.
Danny, come on over here.
Okay.  You behave yourself.
Yeah.
Yes?
I won't make any noise.
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Red Rum.
Are you having a bad dream?
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Danny, come here!
Mommy... Mommy...!
Danny!
Oh!
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
Is Tony one of your animals?
No.  It's the little boy that lives in my mouth.
Why not?
Because he hides.
Where does he go?
To my stomach.
Yes, I'd like you to.
Thank you.
Well how can I repay you?
It's okay, really.
Yes, sir.
Delbert Grady.
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Who?
A nigger.
A nigger!
A nigger cook.
Grady... oh.
You give your word on that do you, Mr. Torrance?
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
All right, sir.
Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
Nice to meet you.
Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
Good.
Pleased to meet you.
Pleasure to meet you.
What line of work are you in now?
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
Women!  Can't live with 'em.  Can't live without 'em!
Good evening Mr. Torrance.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
Yeah.
What time is it?
It's about eleven thirty.
Lots of ideas.  No good ones.
I dreamed that I... that I killed you and Danny.
No, nothing at all.
And you didn't see anything at all?
Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
Good.
I think he did it to himself.
Yes.
How do you like it?
I can't really remember.
Jack...
Of course you are.
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Why?
Wendy!
Stay away...!
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay away from me!
Stop swinging the bat.
Stay away from me.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Stop it!
Wendy give me the bat.
Give me the bat.
Give me the bat.
Jack, stay away from me!
Stop swinging the bat.
Get down.
Go away from me.
Go away.
Give me the bat.
Go away.
Give me the bat.
Wendy...
Wendy...
Yes?
Oh, well - come on in Jack.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
Well, that's very good time, very good.  Please sit down a minute.
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
Great...
Well, that is eh quite a story.
Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?
All the best people.
Thank you, Susie.
Jack is a schoolteacher.
Eight thirty.
Uncle Al-
Blue. This blue.
Jesus.
Sure, Uncle Al.
Brady's a booger and so are you!
If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
Let me help you up.
Went shopping. Why?
Jane, I have to talk to you.
Will you?
Jane-
You're a real booger, you know it?
Well... it is his third.
What?
What kind of noises?
Rattling. Rustling.
Rats...
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty?
Yeah.
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
Do I need one?
Save this one for last.
A tracer. You'll like it.
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
What the hell does that matter?
Well... was it a prescription?
Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?
Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.
It could have been anything, Marty.
And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
You're not going to let it go, are you?
I saw what I saw.
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
What you say?
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
I think I hear it!
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
You know, I just might!
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
You know what we're saying!
LET THY SPIRIT
I think they hear you!
Yes, Mary?
HE'S SO FINE...
Were you tempted?
SING! SING AND YOUR SPIRIT WILL SOAR!
And I'm tearful!
SING!
'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
You know it.
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
Then stop trying to memorize it.  Hit the road.
With love.
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
You can handle this.
What?
Who?  The other woman.  Your wife.
Vince...
Yes?
I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I forgive you.
Yes, Betty?
This prom is a real drag.
Oh-huh.
Oh my! 
What is it, Betty?
Look at that.  Get a gander.
Oh my! 
HE'S SO FINE.
D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes?
Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
You betcha.
I love my heddles.  Show me again.
I know.  It's ancient.
It's a rhythm section.  The beat.
That man -- who is he?
Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
It's true -- I know her.
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
What a shame!
You know that song?
Whatever.
Um, I don't really know this one...
I hear you.  How many days a week do you rehearse?
A bunch of real mama's girls.
Tell me about it.
Amateurs 2
Babies
Again!
What?
Sing!
What?  What time is it?
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
I... I brought you something.
A cigarette?
Right.  Okay.  Bob.  Nice to know you.
Three years.  A rookie.
A novice.
We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.
Now you.
Experience!  Right?
Right.
Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
You watch yourself!
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
Keep moving!
Mary Clarence!
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
We could have been killed!  But you saved me!  Thank you, Mary Clarence!
Give me a C.  A C!
HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
Oh no.  We'll always be together.
Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is that bus?
They're from my old convent.
Again?
She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
Bless you.
It's true!
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
What did He say?
HE SAID, SING THE DEVIL AWAY!
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
Enough joking.
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
You were unhappy?
I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
What?
What? 
Your cigarette -- out.
What?
And all those like you.
You mean black people?
Check your driver's license.
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
Mary Clarence?  Like a guy?  Like a dumb guy?
The vow of obedience.
Like to who?
I'm outta here.
Until sundown.
No food.  Not until sundown.
Yes.  Until breakfast.
Your cell.  Your room.
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
Your cell is more than adequate.
Come, Sister.
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
I am?
You're my Olympic event.
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
The majority has spoken.
Oh?
You saved my life.
I'm a Christian.
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
Then-you run.
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
No nothing.
With nuns?  With rulers?  No way.  I'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince.
Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch.
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
I am?
I've been worried about you.
No -- worried about you.  Personally.
You're not... seeing anybody?
I know, I know.  I'll be careful.  I'll try.
How?
What?
You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
That's not the point!  They need me!
Even nuns have to pee.
Hail, Mary.
But -- wait.
You won't even tell us?
I wouldn't even tell the Pope.
You found him -- but we're not open yet.
We didn't tell you what?
I'm telling you!
Maybe. 
Take care of it.
It's a bluff, Vince.
Not... totally.
What's the problem?
It didn't work, Vince.
So, take it off.
Which one!
Where is she?
She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!
Neither did you!
For like, twelve zillion eternities?
She's praying.
Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.
We're losing it.
We can't leave it up to the Feds!
Yes?
But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
Which convent was that, Sister?
He's decent.
He's kind.
It's better than ice cream.
It's better than springtime.
It's brought people back to the church.
It's no use.  She just isn't here.
We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
She wasn't a nun?
And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...
But how do we get there?
Impossible.
But where?
Yes?
I know. 
She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.
Can you hold?  Can you try?
Find 'em!
Never.  A shoe that size I would have remembered.
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
You must have missed your mark.
I hit him square.
To place it inside its coffin.
What is that?
What are you spying on?
A diseased monster.
You need to sleep.
Bring him.
You need rest.
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
What of it?
The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all.
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Your superiors are two days away!
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
They need guidance.
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
May we look at them now?
A fine idea.
Master Hardenbrook...
Well... that might be... helpful.
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
Excellent.  Then, you are excused till morning.
It's not something people speak of openly.  She did not remarry.
Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
I'm sure I don't know.
Up.
The Western Woods.
Look again.
What kind of nuts?
Not for eating, I assure you.  Watch here.
No, I couldn't...
Witches do not exist.  However...
Listen.
I hear nothing.
What happened?
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
Stay back.
Why this tree?
All I saw was their lantern.
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
Did your father take a loan?
Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
Lady Van Tassel.
What was she doing?
I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
Lady Van Tassel...
I know.  Hold on.
Take the reins.
I doubt that's the end.
Tired.
I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
Small talk.
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
I insist that you have it.
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
They have done nothing of the sort.
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
It was not butchery.
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
But, why?  Tell me why.
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
I apologize if I worried you.
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
What did you say?
Just... keep where you are.
Yes.  I did notice that, thank you.
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
I have not been able to face him yet.
If you think I am behind this, say it.
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
I do not know.  Away.
He moves too fast.
His horse.
Keep climbing.  I will follow...
We have no choice.
Yes, actually.
Use caution.
Where?
Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
It is fine.  Now, I must...
What... ?
Let her go!
Yes... yes.  I think I will...
To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
I didn't see none.
Turn around.  Now!
In a way, yes.
Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
Doctor, he is awake.
Father saw you die.
May I see my mother?
She is guilty.
She has confessed.
No.
Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon my language, ma'am.
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
Yeah, me too.
You got any money?
See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
How are you, Bill?
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
Sure.
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
Well, what did you want?
You have any biscuits for sale?
Naw, we don't have biscuits.
What you got that's good to eat?
Well, I guess it's all good.
What do you like to eat here?
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
Yeah.
What you got in there, warshing?
About a half a mile I think it is.
I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
What?
It went real good.
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?
Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.
Don't rush ever'body, honey.
Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.
That's funny.  You go to bed and take snot nose with you.
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
You believe in the Bible?
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
Childers.
What are all them books?
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
Don't you live somewhere?
I did live there in the state hospital.
Yeah.
How come?
I reckon I feel all right.
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
You told me to come by.
Did you want to play ball with us?
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
Two people.
Were they bad people?
I thought they was.
Maybe they needed it.
It's okay if you're lookin' out for yourself. If it's self-defense. Was it self-defense?
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
I like the way you talk.
I like the way you talk.
Where'd you get them flowers?
You want to go with me?
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
All right then.
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
Pull on your works. Your privates.
Oh, jackin' off?
Yeah.
Why?
Yes sir. Right then it was.
A little ol' boy.
You threw it in a trash barrel?
I heared it cryin' a little through that box.
Yes sir, I reckon it does.
Yeah.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
I've got a feelin' today.
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
You know I would. Whatever you want.
Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
I know he does.
Mama?
Huh?
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
I reckon.
Yeah.
I ain't got no boy.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
I ain't got no boy.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
All right then.
I want to come back and stay here.
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
Yes sir.
My history.
Yeah.
I didn't aim to.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
Well, okay. I got you some.
Yeah.
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
What's that you say?
Why are you here now?
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
Not really to speak of.
Did you knock on the door yet?
Naw, I ain't.
How long have you been standing here?
Quite a spell, I reckon.
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
I'm sorry.
No, we have to get this story.
Why won't he talk to women?
It's my birthday.
Actually, I'm his father.
Better make it charge. 
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
American literature. What else?
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
That's the subject of my last chapter.
Not an easy book.
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
Huh?
What about for you?
For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
Do me a favor, will you?
What's that, Sol?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.
It's yours?
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
No, he's not. You are.
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
Not a peep.
It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
Hi, Auggie.
Uh, better make it one.
You usually get two.
Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? 
Ready. Any time you are.
I'm all ears.
Yeah, probably.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
Yes, I suppose I do.
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
You don't give up, do you?
I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
And what's that supposed to mean?
She looks just like you.
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
No, bully for you.
Five thousand bucks.
It's all yours, baby.
For keeps?
For keeps.
Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
No, it's five thousand dollars.
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
So I can get my job back.
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
Huh?
When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open!
I thought maybe he was pretending.
What can I do for you?
How the hell did you get into the building?
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
I figured he had a right to know.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
Say hi to Paul.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
You shut your mouth! You shut your mouth now!
It's me, honey. It's Mom.
Well what?
Aren't you going to say anything?
What do you want me to say?
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
Yeah? And why is that?
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
So what's the time?
Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
Rashid. Rashid Cole. 
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
East Seventy-fourth Street.
In Manhattan?
Of course. Where else?
The what?
Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address. 
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
Eight-thirty.
Eight-thirty?
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
Take good care of yourself, okay?
I don't know. For helping me out.
Where did you get that thing?
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
You work too hard, you know that?
Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
Is it yours?
Yeah, it might be.
Here, catch.
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
And started to run.
And started to run.
Good thinking.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
It wasn't my fault.
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
Don't worry about it. You've got friends now, remember? Just behave yourself, and everything will work out.
Good. I'm glad that's settled!
It's all right. I really do know them.
I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
Fries?
Yes, please.
Lettuce and tomato?
Yes, please.
Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
I'm a hemotologist, sir, I was asked only t...
You don't.
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
Did he see some <u>danger</u> from defen...
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
It is.
You done your math right.
Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
Happy for him.  And relieved.
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Closer to eight.
And then, something did.  Carl Heine was found dead.  With his head crushed.
But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
You're implying th...
I said.  No further questions.
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael. He'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword.
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
I did.  But the jury won't s...
It's not for the.  They only get to convict him.
Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
All right.  What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
I have told the truth.
Since September.  Last guys got transferred.
Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.
Three kids.  What's she going to do?
It's public record.  If the public cares enough to read it.
Have a look.  At nothing.
You're right.  I better use two.
Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
You're wondering why I held it.
Yes, he was.
Fell.
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
The knife.  What knife?
He hit his head.  On the way in.
Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.
It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
I was checking the cables.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
Sure.  Blood gets all <u>over</u> your hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.
I think you like learning.
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
You have to wonder.
No.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
And her farmhouse...?
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
Sure, anything's poss...
For the third time, yes.
<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
I can't speak for him.
Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore.
That's all he said.
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
Yes.  And that one, too.
Okay, doll.
I suppose you want a tip?
Wanna see my driver's license?
Get lost, will you?
Bull fiddle.
All right, girls.  Who does this belong to?  Come on, now.  Speak up.  Sugar, I warned you!
Thank you ever so.
You're welcome.
It's entirely mutual.
Fresh!
It's private.  Go away.
Manhattans?  This time of night?
Those two musicians from the garage!
Of course I am.
We're not?
Hey, Joe!
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
Look at the bull fiddle - it's dressed warmer than I am.
With you.
With me?
We're not too late, are we?
It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
They got the bull-fiddle.
You don't see any blood?
As far away as possible.
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
With those legs?  Are you crazy?
The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.
And I'm Daphne.
Now you've done it!
Tore off one of my chests.
You'd better go fix it.
You better come help me.
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -
Then pull the emergency brake!
Good night, Josephine.
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
Break it up, girls!  Daphne! Come on, help me!
I got pinched in the elevator.
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
And I'm not even pretty.
Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
Don't get burned, Daphne.
Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
Daphne, you're bothering us.
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
He's going to be ashore with you.
That's right.
Oh, no!  Not tonight, Josephine!
You can both go take a flying jump.
Remember - he's your date for tonight. So smile.
Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
Oh, no.  I'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.
I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.
Have I got things to tell you!
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
I am.
WHAT?
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
You think he's too old for me?
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time!
Like what?
Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
Like right after the ceremony.
Oh.
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
What?
Okay, Joe.
Get me Room 414.
What do you think you're doing?
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
Hello, Room 414?  This is the ship-to-shore operator - I have a call for Miss Sugar Cane.
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
There you go with that we again.
First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
We're not on the pier yet -
Terribly sorry.
I'll say.
See you around, girls.
Good night, honey.
Honey - she called me honey.
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
Oh, I can think of a million things -
Sssh.  Sweet Sue.
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
Stay as long as you'd like.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
No.  It's nice and cozy.
Anything wrong?
No, no.
And your head is hot.
That's ridiculous.
And you've got cold feet.
Isn't that ridiculous?
I'm a very sick girl.
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
I have a very low resistance.
I'm fine.
How's the bottle?
Half-full.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
When?
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
No fair guessing.
We have some bourbon - lets make Manhattans.
Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
I'm just going to get some ice.
Thank you, Daphne.
We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
But there's one thing I envy you for.
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
Neither can I.  Come on - lets go up to her room and tell her - right now.
Oh yes, we do!
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
I met one of them.
Yes.
You like it?
I always did.
Oh - here and there - and around.
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
Yes.  For a whole year.
I thought you said three years.
What's the big idea?
The Florida job?
You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
- you got to be blonde -
We could dye our hair.
- and you got to be girls.
We could -
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
I am Cinderella the Second.
Let me carry one of the instruments.
Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
You must be quite a girl.
Wanna bet?
Goodbye?
Oh, you don't get off that easy.
No, thank you.  I'll walk.
About that roadhouse -
You're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself.
Yes, Osgood?
You're leading again.
Sorry.
Come one!
Flower girl.
And I can never have children.
We'll adopt some.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
Well - nobody's perfect.
To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
You ain't going nowhere.
We won't breathe a word.
You won't breathe nothing' - not even air.
You're making it up pretty good so far.
Because I got some plans -
Yes, Joe.
My car?  Why, you -
Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
It's not the backs that worry me.
What kind of band is this, anyway?
William Morris!
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
Yes, we're the new girls.
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
Oh.
I'll say.
You can't trust those guys.
Every time!
You know - I play tenor sax.
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
I want mine to wear glasses.
Search me.  I mean - I'll see.
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Would you mind terribly?
Not at all.
Good night, Sugar.
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
Seventy-five.  That's three-quarters of a century.  Makes a girl think.
Just my feminine intuition.
She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.
My fault.
I don't think so.
I wish you'd make sure.
Why?
Who are you?
Now, really -
Not very likely.
Are you staying at the hotel?
Your face is familiar.
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
Well, I'm not.
That's very interesting.
Up, up, up.
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
For your own amusement?
So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
- opening of the Opera -
- riding to hounds -
- and always the same Four Hundred.
It's been delightful meeting you both.
And you will come to hear us tonight?
What?
Guess!
They repealed Prohibition?
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
It's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.
Yes - that's our hurricane cellar.
It's all right for a bachelor.
What is it?
Oh - a member of the herring family.
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
It's the crews' night off.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
You mean - like frigid?
Have I?  I'm trying all the time.
Nothing at all?
Complete washout.
That makes me feel just awful.
I don't want to bore you.
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
Thanks just the same.
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
What is it?
So inhale!
I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
Good morning.
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Let's make it an even million.
Did you have a nice time?
Nice?  It was suicidally beautiful.
From a rich millionaire.
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
I told you - I'm not very bright.
I come to the old lady's funeral.
Booze.
Some people got no respect for the dead.
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
We got different information.
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
Toothpick Charlie?  Never heard of him.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
These are my lawyers - all Harvard men.
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
What's his first name?  And where does he live?
That's an opera, you ignoramus.
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
You shave with your spats on?
I sleep with my spats on.
Yes, sir.
And who runs it?
I already told you.
Refresh my memory.
Spats Colombo.
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
Well, we all got to go sometime.
Orders from Little Bonaparte.
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
You don't owe me no nothing.
Exactly! Todays my day. Tomorrow will be my day. And the day after that? My day.
Except its Scotch.
Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Dont worry about it.
Are you sure youre okay?
Im fine. I promise.
Hey.
Sure, disappear. Weve been walking away our whole lives.
To make sure youre okay.
If Ed ever found out....
Or Kat....
Jeffrey told her last night.
Last night?
Theres a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
You are taking the piss?
I had to say something to get you here.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
What?
Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
No, thats not it.
And Kat was fully clothed.
Oh, shut up. Youre an optician.
And you do now?
Doesnt look like nothing.
Oh, hello.
Shrink, actually.
Crikey.
What?
Nothing, nothing.
Hello, Katmandu.
Yeah?
I have regrets.
Its called character. God, youre predictable.
Right. Seven.  Christ, thats a long time, isnt it?
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Its no big deal. I promise.
Kat.
You have feet?
Really?  Dont get too attached.
Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in share. People do that.
What does your gut say?
Youre too good for him.
Why?
Im compulsive and weird?
Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
Its cute.
You stand on your tiptoes.
I do?
A wedding.
I have a friend at the magazine.
Your friend guaranteed my anonymity.
What?!
What do you think?
Oh, come on. Youre like the Yoda of escorts.
Show me.
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasnt one of them.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
Make out with you for free.
Yeah.
I didnt say he was worth it.
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
So whats with the nickname?
I have to.  Im the best man.
Therapist.
You knew?
Im so sorry.
You pawned it.
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
You want me to let him in?
Of course, dont be silly.
Hi, kiddo.
Meet Nick.
Its complicated, Dad.
...but its getting there. 
Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.
I havent thought about that in years.
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
That does it...
That's where we come from first?
That's where we came from first.
What he talk 'bout?
It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...

You learnin' anything at that school?
Hi, Daddy...
Hi to you, son...

Goodnight to you, son...
Mornin', Daddy...
They gone to the field...
Guess I can't just lay here, then.
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?

Tuck that shirt in, David Lee.

Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
Same as we -- they pray.
Children, come here...
You sure can, son...
No mam -- I looked all over.
Listen, Mama...
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
Good night...
I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
Who's Miss Johnson?
Miss Johnson is a teacher, and...
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
It's the heat.
He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.
He can't get up, Mama!
Come in, children.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now...
No, thank you -- I gotta go do some work in the field today.
No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
I'll walk...
I'm used to it.
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
Might be...
At the way you ask funny questions, Josie Mae!
I brought these walnuts to trade.
I wanta get some things.
Tired.
You ready to eat?
I'll wait till after the children.
You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?
Yeah, just stay where you is...
I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
Behold my glory.
What... are you?
I am the clitoris.
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
Eric!
How would you like to gargle rat jiz?
I said -
But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
Chef, do you know anything about women?
Very funny!
I saw him last night!
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
How the fuck should I know!!
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!
Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
You bet your fucking ass it was!
Yeah,  <b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!!</b>
Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!

We're not gonna have pie and punch!

Whoops.
WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!!

AGAGAH!!
Okay.    Not.

Yes, hon?
I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
Norwegian Ass Raper.
Oh yeah.
A hunger strike? For what?
I don't know.
Something big, children.
Hey, Chef.
It's... It's not good children.
Oh no, it's that kid.
This is the place--
What?
This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?
Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting!
Doky maping she deeder!!!
Baba mama!
Mph rmph rm rmph rm?
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
Then move out of the way.
Oh, you want out of hell, huh?
Do as I say, Kyle!
We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
MOM!!!
KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
What's the password?
Uhh... I don't know.
Guess.
Uhh... Bacon.
Okay.
FREEZE!!
Yeah, I guess.
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror?
For pooping, silly.
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
Kay.
Oh... Alright, back you go.
We can't leave without you!
It's okay, I am done for.
We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
YOU BASTARD!!
You bastards!!
It isn't fair!
Our moms suck!
How do we do that?
I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
Good thing she was never your girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.
Totally!
Yeah, they suck.
What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
Yeah, so what do we say?
I thought you had something planned.
Are you sure, Kenny?
What is 'fisting'?
-Or monkey fucker-
Huh?
Yes?
What the hell is going on?!
Oh.
The F word?!
What is Terrance and Phillip?
Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
Then we'll have to resort to plan B and call the v-chip organization.
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
Hello, Brooke Shields!
Cheers, Terrance!
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
And you call yourself a Canadian!  I told you we should of done Leno!
You would know, dummy.
You did? Just now?
Terrance! NO!
Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
I am.
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
I know.
You don't care.
I mean cute dumb. Now bend over!
Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
I don't care!  I want to talk about it now!
That's nice, Stan.
Yup.
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
You don't get it Stan... You just don't get it.
What's the matter, Wendy?
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?
Wendy?
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
My friend the clitoris told me.
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
You didn't?
<b>Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for</b>
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
And ze rope?
Check.
And the butfor?
He's shutting off the air!!!
Oh yeah...
Oh Sara...
Anna...
It can't be.
Excuse me?
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
Magnificent, magnificent.
Well I appreciate that.
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
So...
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
I did nothing to the monitors.
They are awaiting further information.
The device has stopped responding.
Ain't it the truth. Must be good to be rich.
It's a little late for you to be up.
Well shut it off at once!
Well it's a good thing that I did.
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
All right, I'll give it a shot.
It's steady, good benefits.
Thank you.
Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
That's me.
I know, I know.
Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
Damage control!  What kind of damage? What's going on Barnes!
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
Let's get something straight, Chappy!
That's clear.
Over and out!
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
Like that piece of ass he was with.
Don't say that!  It ain't over till it's over!
Will you shut up already?
Just don't move around too much.
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
This is my second commercial flight.  I used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
I don't know.
Well maybe we can do something like that.
Seen one like it before?
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
Close every door behind you!
Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.
Even if we do, it might be too late.
I understand.
Ready as I'll ever be.
So we did.
At this point I'm ready for anything.
Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
Yeah?
Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
Sure.
Helllp!
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
What?  What are you talking about?
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
Taylor!  Where are you?
Barnes?
I'm about to blow the wall.
Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!
How does the distress signal look?
So what's going to happen to you?
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Sooner than later.
Over and out.
We have room!  Let's go!
What do you mean?  What happened!
We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.
Marry you?
I don't know.  Wave to them!
Congratulations on your...recent award.
Thank you.
No, just enjoying the view.
He's in the bathroom.
Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
Homesick?  It's only been two days!
Send it back if you don't want it.
How am I supposed to know?
What makes you so sure?
The engines!
Mac.  What's shaking?
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
That's affirmative.
I'm from Akron.
What kind of man?
A bowler.
You have orange whips?
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
No. I'm from Akron.
It belonged to my dad.
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
What do you want with old man Faz?
Lemme see your ball.
You afraid we're gonna steal it?
We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
Are you guys bruddas?
I hate fuckin' opera.
No kiddin'.
Wait! That's an aria!
I'd buy it!
See ya 'round Faz.
Theo's bowled on the tour.
Oh, a professional man. What'll you have?
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
Wish me luck.
Theo.
Need some advice, huh.
Don't worry about the Congress, they're just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies.
100 years! 
It's mine.
Grace Skinner.
She's my mom.
I ain't nobody's father!
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
It looks like dwarf bowling.
You wish!
I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
I'm getting to like it here.
No...
I didn't think so.
He says that to all his wives.
I am underground.
I never saw you.
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
Hello, mom?
I found dad.
Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.
I gotta go. Love ya mom.
Cool!
Theo. Howzitgoin.
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
Who's there?
Buzz Fazeli.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
Who's there?
Junior.
Someone wants to play with me?
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?
I like you, Theo. You bowl with soul.
Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
She ran away to be with that...  that Motocross champion.
You still got the touch Junior.
Bowling "Center"!
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
Line up where you want it.
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
I'm a bowler.
They suspended me.
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
He's my father, Millie.
He's no father to you.
The Peter Pan.
Whips...orange whips.
Uh...over easy.
Coming right up.
Mine, and they never tip.
What do you want with my dad?
Everything has it's drawbacks.
Where did your brother escape from?
The mental hospital.
What does he do?
It's a vicious cycle.
No, not at all.
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
Can I ask you something personal?
I'd rather you didn't.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Not while I'm in training.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No. Do You?
No. Not at the present.
So, what about you?
Do I want you?
We'll get into that later.
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
Why were you suspended?
Well, that was plan A.
What's plan B?
Plan B is your dad.
What's plan C?
Plan C...  ...is me.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
More than you could afford.
Come on, bargain with me.
I could let them go for ten.
...lane six. Yes.
Why should I help that old fuck.
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.  Too late for what?
Too late for what, Sheila?
Why not?
It's Junior, isn't it.
Tell me what happened Theo.
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
I feel sick.
You should.
Are you sure he's dead?
I didn't stop to take his pulse.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
You don't get two chances with Junior.
At least I'll die smiling.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
Fuck plan C!
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
Suck my dick!
I am a professional man.
Lips still for sale?
I'm not here to bowl.
Tell your little pal to let go.
Breeze, give him his ball back!
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
Who identified the body?
Please, Dr. Levine.
Open it, Captain!
Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your seat!
They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
Fletcher, I want you back here.
It's burning...
Get out of there!
I can't see...
Fletcher!  Now!
I can't...
Back away then.
Wait a minute --
I said back away.
Would you wait a minute?
What is it?
How about I just press the button?
Two and a half days?
But she's --
Nobody move!
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
What was that?
Fifty yards and closing.
What do we use for defense?
He's right beneath us.
That's our reserve air.
Do you see it?
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
Now!
Pull it, damn it!
Captain.
Captain.  Right, forgive me.
The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
Nothing else.
Press?  No, I haven't.
Well, we don't have all the facts yet.
Storm?  What storm?
A thousand feet.
Then why am I here?
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
-- dating the crash at least that old.
Maybe older --
It's impossible.
ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
Take a look.
I don't know.  But it's something alien.
What?
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
I don't know.  That's the point.
Everything can be killed.
What do you mean, he's missing?
He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
You don't want to know.
I think I do.
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
-- and then brought her down here --
-- I didn't know it would come to this --
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Jerry?
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
Working on it now, sir.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
They're coming.
Nothing, sir.
Fuck him.  What?  Hello?
Well, where the fuck is he?
In the ship, sir.
They've left, keep watching!
Sir!  Sir, the door -- it's opening.
If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
Then how can it be chipped?
Yes, Harry.
So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
Ted seems to have some ideas.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
Please watch your closest monitor...
I have to tell you.  It's strange.
How do you mean, strange?
It's not ignorant.
What -- you want me to retype it?
Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.
What are you going to do -- shoot her?
What is it?
Radiation shield, you think?
What do you make of this?
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
Sir, about leaving --
To what?
Internal power.
Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
What's inside the sphere.
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
The sensors are picking up something outside.
Resetting the sub.
What sub?
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
That's quite a secret.
Because when we get down there --
Wait -- down where?
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
Underwater?
Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
The library.
Yeah, it was awful.
What about you?  What happened to you?
What?
Beth --
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
What could have done this?
What are they?
Eggs.
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
Fuck you, Norman!  It's right here...
In Edmunds' things.
You went through Edmunds' things?
Don't tell me to calm down!
You told him about me?
You did, didn't you?
Don't do this.
You bastard.
Beth --
I have to reset the sub.
Don't bother me, Norman.
It's not worth the risk.
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
Why should I go?
In case you die, too?
I don't trust Harry to do it.
I would.  But my suit --
I fixed your suit.
You don't trust me?
But I don't know how --
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
You can't.  Counter's at 10 minutes. You don't have time.
Still clear.
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
I think so, Beth.  Yes.
The refridgerator.
We must've had it delivered then.
Wait a second --
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
You don't believe me.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
What?
Why would Harry go back to using a code?
Something for burns.
Ephedrine hydrochloride.
Ulcers.
Sintag.
A synthetic opium analogue.
Tarazine?
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Bingo.
Antihistamine.  For bites.
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
Parasolutrine?
How do you spell it?
P-a-r-a-s-o...
It's a soporific.
What's that?
Causes sleep.
It's like a sleeping pill?
Three to six hours.
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
How fast does it take effect?
Doesn't say.
You want to kill him?
Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
For what?
Not believing you.
In the sub.  Resetting the timer. Why?
What do you mean, different?
I'm feeling better.
Are you?
You think I'd really drink that?
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
You know what I mean.
Do you fear them?
Are you manifesting them?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
He can't manifest.
No, he can't.
C'mon -- what?
You're lying --
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
You manifested that, Beth.
But I have to, Norman.
I promise --
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
It's either this... or I kill you.
I'm not fucking with you, Norman. You've fucked yourself.
Leave me alone, Norman.
I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
Top shelf, is it?
You hear that?
Hear what?
Get away from me!
Beth --
Get away --
Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
By the bunks.
Who says it's a he?
For whoever's in that thing.
It's an American spacecraft.
Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood right there --
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
Just in time for what?
Like what?  I'm not --
You're staring at me.
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
Yes you are...
Won't make any difference.  The tapes document everything.
What?
You holding up alright?
Fine.  I'm fine.
Don't be defensive.
I'm not being defensive.
You sound defensive.
I'm fine.
No, why don't --
Wait a second, I --
Look, would you --
Whatever I can do to help.
Time travel.  A black hole.
Which one?  Let me get the list out.
Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
Gimme another explanation.
No.  I didn't say that.
Then what, Norman?
It's like...
What are you still doing here?
You remember opening the door?
Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
Then explain it to me.
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
You don't remember that?
Norman, where are you?
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
You're clear.  You see the airlock?
What do you mean?  She's not here?
When I woke up, nobody was here.
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
Beth left?
I thought she was with you.
You didn't say that about the food?
Wisconsin?
How do we decode it?
Don't have to.  Watch.  It'll do it for you.
That's right.
You know what it is, Harry.
Stop what?  What are you -- ?
Help me lift her.
Hold on.
I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
I heard!  I heard!
Shut up and catch.
I'm trying to keep balance with --
Gimme a second --
You got her?
Well, press something!
Wait!
Nine hundred feet to surface.
We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
What is it, Harry?
Just one of Norman's many secrets.
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
That's right.
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
If it is an alien spacecraft --
Save your breath.  It's not an alien spacecraft.
Please.  It must have flown here --
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
Arrived?  From where?
"We are friends".
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
The others, sir?
Beth and Harry?
They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.
Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.
No, they didn't say --
This way, sir.
Told me what?
You've heard of me?
Huh?
What report?
You mean you don't know?
Know what?
Geologists?  At a plane crash?
What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
He's a pussy.
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
Still, make a note I recognized that.
Squint harder.
Please, Ted.
Try this one.
This is like nursery school.
Unless it's an act.
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
Not that I know of.  Why?
You seen my suitcase?
Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
Was it a military crash?
I don't know.
I'm beginning not to like you.
I'm not afraid of anything...
May the Force be with you.
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
Of course.  I'm a Bendu officer.
I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
You saw through me?
You could put it that way.
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
They use the Bogan Force.
These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
He can't find Organa Major.
Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
You look great!  The uniform and everything!
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
Just be warned, that things aren't always as they seem... especially the starforce recruiting posters.
Yes, sir.
Have you been checked out?
I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.
What's that?
Forget it, son.
I'll make a report later.
Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear.
Was this trip really necessary?
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
I'd better go see how he's doing.
I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
It's automatic.
What are you saying?
I don't know... I've never fought anyone.
I think I did.
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
Not if this tunnel deadends.
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
Well, if it's not, we'll be facing that Death Star all by our lonesome.
Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
No need, everything's under control.
With four casualties?!
You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
He'll be well cared for.
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
Well, ask him.  Tell him we need five thousand.
I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
I read you sir.
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
Something... I've got...you don't.
You rich kids... are all the same !
It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
YAAAAAAAA !
Death to all bugs !
I didn't see him !
He was our teacher... He was great.
Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.
Not enough, I guess.
We're the old men, Ace.
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
Sir... I guess I do, sir.
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
Others are waiting.
You got it bad.
Ace of spades.
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
I got Games & Theory.
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
Don't you have to finish the game ?
They revoke our flight status.
Oh, I see... teamwork.
Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
Well, whad'ya know...
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
It looks like an... asteroid.
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
Excuse me...!
You're upset, that's alright.
A funeral.
I don't know, Zander.
I do.
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
Your turn...
Who ?
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
It's all I think about anymore.
Why not ?
Johnny, my Dad's home today.
How do I know if this is love ?
It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.
I'll meet you outside.
Good luck at the academy.
What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
You two have so much in common.
I can't help it.
He's nothing like you.
I don't even know if you're my girl.
Who cares ?
You're right. Let's never stop...
Shhh...
Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
Did you get Starside R&D ?
Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
I love you.
You don't look very happy to see me.
That was just a mix up.
I like it. It's kinda...you.
See you on the bounce !
We've gotta go get her !
Thank you, ma'am.
No way, ma'am !
Number 4, contact Fleet and tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way.
That's it, we're empty ma'am !
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
Too bad for her if she's not around.
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
How come we never got together ?
Uh, look, Diz...
Guess you gotta go.
You're the best.
No thanks, Diz.
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
Flip six, three hole.
What ?
You got it.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
I'm gonna need a squad leader.
You used to dance...
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
Well, excuse me, sir...
What ?
I'm on it !
All bands.
It's alright 'cause I got to have you, Johnny...
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
Looks like rain.
This time of the year...?
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
Oh, is that how it is ?
Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
Good luck. It's not there anymore.
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
Don't stand there dumb... GO !
Doesn't look like it to me.
No, sir.
I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
You can never be sure.
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers.
The Rodger Young just burned up...
Move out.
Not a problem.
Been better, buddy.
What is your position ?
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
What is it, Rico ?
Yes, sir.
Who's that with you ?
Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
Yes, sir !
Cover us, Ace !
V'ger is that which programmed me.
Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?
V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
Who is V'ger?
V'ger is that which seeks the Creator.
You may proceede.
The Creator has not answered.
The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
The information will not be disclosed.
V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
<U>Answer</U>!
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
Departure angle.
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
Yes.
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
You are, Mister Decker. I'm afraid you'll have to double as Science Officer.
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
I'm aware of that, sir.
Stop competing with me, Decker!
Granted.
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
It's taken control of the computer...!
It's running our records! Starfleet strength, Earth defenses...
They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.
That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
A tractor beam...
   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
Decker....!
Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
Our Exec and Science Officer...
Twelve seconds...!
Impact in fifteen seconds...
Ten seconds....
Opinion, Mister. Spock?
Viewer, standard ahead.
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
Aye, sir.
We're already two settings below that, sir.
Thrusters at station keeping...
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
See that it is.  Take me over, please.
Sit down, please.
And whatever you sensed out here....
I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.
Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
Mr. Decker... ?
Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
Ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.
New crystals: they must contain the most recent data obtained --
A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
We're ready, sir.
Thank you, Scotty. Stand by.
Helm ready, sir.
Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
<U>Urgent</U> signal from Starfleet, Captain!  <U>All</U> Earth defense systems have gone dead.
Tractor beam remains constant...
Annie...got an umbrella...?
I'll be there.
You bringing your new friend?
Sure plan to.
He'll eat potroast and like it.
Go you Huskies?
You bet your life.
Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
I need a typewritter.
I have one, but they lost it.
The people in New Hampshire.
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
"Anguish."
You quit.
Why did you quit?
I just got kicked off my first movie.
Yes.
Why?
It's about life.
N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
It was either that, or a sardine.
That's true.  You grow up here?
Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou Theatre.
But, but but but...
That: in an act of...
Yes...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
As the Old Mill goes around...
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
Goodbye.
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
That's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
I love your script.
How can you <u>say</u> that?
<u>Yes</u>...
About <u>conflict</u>...
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
I...
Me?
Yes.
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
Cast stood me up.
Uh huh.
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
You got a paperclip?
Never saw the point of 'em.
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
Fix my glasses.
Better idea...
"Room Service!"
You have to sign for it.
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
I don't drink.
One moment.
Read the card.
Oh.
Then I'll come back, then.
No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow.
Because I'd met someone else.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
You believe that?
I do if you do.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
I used to go out with a politician.
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
Why?
Go you Huskies!
I can't get it to come out right.
It used to be the Old Mill.
What've you got?
I hurt you?
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
...yes.
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
Hi.
Where you going?
No, that's true.
Gosh, you look nice.
...what...?
Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper.  Show you the plans...
It does?
Did as of last week.
You'd do the newspaper right here.
You know what else a man can do?
Sleep well?
Yeah, you?
Oh yeah.
...and we could get up every morning...
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
Well ain't you amazing.
I saw...
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
Carla was in the car, right?
...you think that's right...
I'm going to tell the truth.
I'll knit you a sweater.
Morning.
...I'm sure that people are upset...
Waal, that's what I'm saying.
After Drama Group.
Drama Group?
What is it, a surprise?
That's right...
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
Yes, that's right.
Ten thousand dollars.
That's so beautiful...
I beg your pardon?
We had a date.
We did...?
Where have you been...
I've been thinking.
He works on the movie.
No.  Don't tell me that.
I'm sorry.
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
Well, then, what's he doing here?
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
Courthouse back in town.
Town ain't got no courthouse.
What?
Hold court, they have to, science lab, the high school.
Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire?
They know what her tits look like.
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
Whatever it is.  GO <u>do</u> it.  How you doing on the permit?
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
...why am I here...?
Now: I'm looking at the...
Fifteen hands.
Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
They think it's your First Wife...
That Could Be.
She wasn't in the...
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
What'll I do for fun?
Whyn't you learn your lines?
I <u>know</u> my lines...
Nothing happened.
No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
I loved it...he...
Isn't he...
It's...
Sister, I've just come from a <u>fire</u>...
I don't eat vegetables.
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
Sure, what have you got?
What do you drink?
Bourbon and Milk.
How old are you?

I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.
I...
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Tell it with...
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
We've got three days to...
She's a <u>waitress</u>.

You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."
Everybody needs a hobby.  Okay, look Page...
Everybody needs a hob...
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
Well.  What seems to be the...?
Could I see it please...?
If there's anything I...
Scene <u>twelve</u>...arrival at the mill.
There's other things to be learned.
Izzat so?
The Mayor's outside.
What's his name?
Mr. Bailey.
Who is it raped you?
Nobody.

Get him on the...
Cool it, Babe, you started this...

That's my...
Will you help me out...?
I...
I just...
Claire, Bob Bar...
No, no...Please.
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
I can't do it, Walt.
You can't do what?
Is...Is the Movie!
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
Now, look.  Claire:  Listen to me.  I want to tell you a story.
Who are these from?
No, she didn't Claire.  But I think you should do the scene.
I know, I know.
...wants a piece...
Yes.
And you know what...?
We, we have to give it.

...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
Bob are you alright...?
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
Put something in his room.  What does he like?
Yes.
Did she throw up?
That isn't very nice.
Why not?
She won't stop crying...
Well.
Who got their heads cut?
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
You said <u>three</u>...?
<u>Did</u> I?  I think you're mistaken.
I, uh...I'm leaving.
Why?
Mornin, Chessy...how's the back...?
Doug, the traffic light...
Doug, this is Mr...
What is the...?
Arrest him.
This young woman.
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
He didn't have to tell...
I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
Okay...
Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
My wife's going to have a baby.
How about that.
Mmmm.  You have children?
No.  No, but we're planning to.
My wife just went into labor...
Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
I had a witness I would.
What?
The writer.
He saw the accident...?
You bet he did.
Wait a sec, Marty.  Call us back.  Two minutes.
Oh, that's <u>great</u>.  Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
I can only write on a manual.
I know the feeling.
That's a real <u>fault</u>, I...
I grew up on your mov...
I know you do.
Where have you been...?
Why?
I know you are.  Go you Huskies.
You want me to lie.
I don't getcha.
The girl was in the car.
I treated you like a son or nephew.
It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
No, what is it?
The girl was in the car.
Then you're finished in show business.
I can write it.  I can't type it.
I didn't say anything to them.
How do you know you saw it?
I don't know.
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
You didn't see it...
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
You were there.  At...at 10:35...?
I left that for you.
That's thoughtful.  Ziz good, you try this?
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
How was your flight?
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
They're coming Fedex...
What's in all the bags?
That's what I said.
Find the money.
We don't have the money.
<u>Find</u> it.
If you do the product placement...
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
Is that one hell of a kid?
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
He's got a gift for fiction.
We got to do something nice for <u>him</u>.
There's no witnesses...
No, just the...there's no witnesses, right...?
...not the Lazyboy...
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
I want them thrown in jail.
Sherry, Sherry...
That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...
George, that is so kind of you.
Yes, I hear it.
It takes all kinds.
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
Waal, what was the per-screen average...?
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.
Zat true?
Givvem a cigarette...
...we can't lose the wind...
Wally, I got to takes out that window from the dog.  I can't shoot through...
I don't care.  <u>Fix</u> it.
I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.
I killed her!
She's <u>dying</u> and <u>Rache</u> is your mother now!
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
It happens.
Why does Rachel scream?
During sex.
Because it feels really incredibly good.
I like talking about it.  At least, to you.
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
Then why are you putting on mascara?
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
I'll be there for you.
Well.  It's for you.
She knows every neat junk food place.
THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
...I'm not deaf, y'know.
Not with my mouth open.
Good girl.
Oh, yeh.
Mom?  What's wrong?
Nothing sweetheart.
Don't. Take me with you.
Good.  That's very good.
Don't touch me!  I'm <u>allergic</u> to you!
This is my house too!
And this is my room so get out!
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
You think this is funny?
IT'S NOT YOUR <u>FAULT</u>!!
No, baby.  You're gonna use <u>my</u> words.
That's my girl...
Don't take my picture!
You owe me a quarter.
YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS!  WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?
There's worse things.
Cos she loves you.
Fine!  Eat in the cupboard.
Then have a donut --
No.
Alright starve.
Annabelle let's get something clear.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
Mmmm!  Tasty.  You're a master chef Ben. Just like your dad.
How could I be?  We learned some magic...
Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
Lava's hateable.  I never thought of that.
Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
I knew where I was all the time.
Yes...if you like big hair...
What honey?
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
Mom...?
Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.
Pray.  We never find out.
You have the WORST flu since...
I have cancer.  Do you know what that is?
I'm still sick, but I'm better.
Where Ben?
Before you.
How do you know?
I helped.
Rache says it's from you.
Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
Half.  Of him.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
You say that like I don't know that.
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
Every day.  More and more.
Let's take our best shot.
Duncan.  I've got an <u>even</u> <u>better</u> idea...
Remarried.  There is no move.
I'm here.
Because you don't really seem here.
You think I didn't get that?
We're not discussing your age.
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
Me too.
Good...Well...Take care.
We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
Don't do this.
And I'm supposed to care.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
Walk in the park.  And thanks for the 'we'.
I live or I die.
We don't have any coffee.
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
Annabelle, how's your video rep...
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
But it's not on the schedule!
You got to hell!
Look, I...
I didn't do it for you.  Believe me.
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
I did it for her.
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
Jackie?
Yes?
Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
Don't flatter yourself.
But I came here to...
Luke.  Can't live like that.
Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups?
How the hell would you know?
I don't, but...
How would you know <u>anything</u>?
See, I know that.
Ironic, huh?
Beats me.  Ask your mom.
It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
Yeh, that's bull.  I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.
I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'
And you said...
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
Feeling the pressure?
He won't discuss it.  Just calls it history.
And I'm going to win.
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
I lost him.  I was panicked.
What do I have that you don't?
You're the hip and fresh.
You ride with Annabelle...
You'll learn.
Yeh, it's cheaper.
We have the kids this weekend, so...
You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
Can't handle them myself is what you mean.  Can't.
I trust you of course I do but --
They don't hate you --
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
Rache, get out of th...
I think so...What do you think?
I think so too...
Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
Are you hungry?  You could make us something?
I know that.
Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.
Imagine my relief.  So what's for dinner?
What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.
Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
Because you've changed so much.
Does Jackie know this?
No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.
Don't ever say that.
What if he is?
He isn't.
What?
Hey. What's up?
There are some rumors...
Like what?
Oh.
Thanks, Scoob.
He was in a concentration camp?
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
Thank you.
Nice to have you here.
Great to be here.
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Yes, Mikey?
Really? How many?
Four brothers and five sisters.
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
We had to work. My family was poor.
Must've been hard being poor.
I'm still poor.
No.
Speak English.
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
Who is Jesus?
My baby.
You have a bay?
My grandchild-baby.
Oh. How did it happen?
Poison gas.
But still, you can't be sure.
I am sure.
But really, you never know.
I know!
Why was he on Death Row?
For rape and murder.
Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
Yes, I do. I love them!
I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
What's an audience going to tell you?
I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.
Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
Yes, Mikey?
Got a lot of homework?
Is everything OK?
I dunno.
How was the class?
Ready for tomorrow?
What's tomorrow?
You mean, again?
Well, I changed the ending a little.
Oh. What happens now?
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
You know he hated my story also.
Your story was terrible!
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
Oh, well, I don't have them yet, but 
I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
The same.
The same. Same as what?
Just the same.
Man, it's just, like, conversation.
Yeah?
We have to talk.
Tired of this shit...
Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
OK. Stay there. I'll be right back.
Hi, Dad!
Come here, give me a hug!
Gee, you're home early!
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Uh huh.
Can I join you?
Thank you for being honest.
Thanks.
Ni...
...gger.
...gger.
Say, 'Nigger.'
Nigger.
'Fuck me hard!'
Fuck me hard!
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Again!
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
Again!!
NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!...
I dunno. See if I have any connections.
Hello, is this Pam?
Who is this?
Toby Oxman.
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Oh, fine. How are you?
Great!
Great!
So what's going on?
But...you called.
Well, I went to law school, if you can believe that.
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
I do.
Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
Huh. Kids?
Yeah.
How many?
Three.
Great. How old are they?
Eight, six, and four.
Maybe she has caller ID.
Thanks.
How'd you get it?
I know.
No, I don't think so...
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
Yeah?
You know...I like you.
Yeah. I know.
I mean...
No, thanks.
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Prnceton.
Can I see what you have so far?
Yeah. He went to Harward.
Oh.
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Times up!
There isn't anyone! He's opened that whole sector now!
Why? Are we going dancing?
If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
Who's got matches?
We're outta here--
We don't have time!
Yeah and we don't have much ammo either!
What happened!
What do you think?
Yeah?...
There's the fence...
You're talking about committing suicide!
Well Cooper...
Even better.
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
It's nothing to worry about.
Where does it lead?
Are you going to kill us?
I don't know.  If you gave me a reason to...
I don't want any...
I insist...
The transmission is an hour old...
He's in there...
I'll let the senator tell you.
What do you mean?
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
Excellent...excellent!
I say we head out.
Agreed--let's move it.
Captain it would be impossible to turn down such a gracious request.
We can't--it's power driven!
Get your men to do it!
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
There's enough in one vial...
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Moffo!
I have your word, Mister President?
Yes, of course.
At his office in the Capitol.
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.
How dare you talk to me in this manner?
I know nothing of the sort!
Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?
You mean you'll tell us his name???
That's right, fella.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
Who the hell do you think you are, sir???
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
General Schmuck?
Yes!  Who the hell is this?
What did you say, sir?
What kind of trouble?
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
This is General Ripper speaking.
Yes, sir.
Certainly, General.  Why do you ask, sir?
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
No, sir.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?
You're damned right they are.
How much soda, sir.
Just a squirt.
To peace on earth.
Ask away, Major.
No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
I don't think so, sir.
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
Do you think they would cheat?
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
Peace on earth.
I presume the planes are armed?
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
What the hell is Plan-R?
I want to talk to General Ripper.
But we can't communicate with the base.
They're coming in now.
I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
Naturally I am, sir.
He says they've only shot down three planes.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Look, he's there, and you're here.
Roger. One-three-eight.
Lothar, take your checks now.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
I don't think so.
Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
Can't help it.  What's the wind like?
Maybe it's an exercise.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
What?
War.
War?
Forget it, Quentin.  It can happen to the best of us.  Now let's get squared away.
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Call them every five miles.
Thirty-five, still straight.
Maximum ECM!
Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
They must have made a visual contact.
Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.
They can't touch us at this height.
Hang on, boys.
Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
Primary arming switch.
Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
Where'd they get you?
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Some kind of signaling.
No kidding.
Shoot, Lothar.
Hellnno, Major.  I was just trying to think the thing through.
As soon as I've checked over the route. About five minutes.  All right?
Primary trigger switch.
First safety.
Seond safety.
Check, ten thousand air burst.
Everything still checks out okay.
Binky?
He's dead.
What happened?
In the back...feels like an arrowhead.
Hell, he looks dead.
Listen, give me a shot quick!
Recall what mistake?
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
What are you talking about?
Wait a minute, Major.  "OPE," that's the recall code.  Where would they get that?
How the hell do I know?  Maybe the war's over.
Then that settles it, doesn't it?
Like hell it does.
Right.  So how could we get any messages?
I don't get you, King.
I said that's the point!
Then get off my back!
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
I'm okay.  What's up?
But I get a red light.
Have you tried the emergency system?
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
Can I have some?
Knock yourself out.
Sure, all the time, in Group.
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
Was it okay?
Yeah!
What did you guys think?
Slides go with it.
Typical male.
Typical male.
No I quit.
Hey, you said you did a video?
What's it about?
A cloud.
A cloud?
Your a nurse?
Yeah.
Do you wanna go to the van?
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
Needs some pizza in his diet.
No, I'm here. Where are you?
Where are you-hoo?
Shut up! Aw...
Yeah.
Well, shit! Happy fucking birthday!
Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.
No, no.
Jesus Christ.
No, he's not with a girl.
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
Watch out for that tree.
Okay, okay.
A long, long, long...
So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.
So you can do an album cover?
No, no, I wasn't trying.
No. Life is too short.
No, I'm not worried.
Good.
No, I mean, no one.
Uh, last night...
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
Oh, and guess who showed up.
You know?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
No. It didn't, Buff.
Wait. Hey, man.
Erica is in the van back there.
Look.
Hey, man.
She's in the van.
What she doin' in the van, man?
What?
She's dead.
She's dead?
No, no, no.
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Yeah, man.
It's bullshit. Look! Look!
Yeah, right, publicist.
Come on.
Play it! Come on!
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Hey.
Sure I am. It's fun.
Mm. And your like, what else?
Well, that's one way of putting it.
Am I fucking him?
Shit.
In what way?
Mm, in a horizontal and wet way!
Buff is funny. God.
Alright, Pony!
I'm so burnt-out.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
You better! Yes!
I will.
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Yo! Your spitting rice all over us! God.
That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
No, you don't belong here. We were here before you.
It's okay.
Glad it's okay.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Oh, you were there?
No, but I heard it was great.
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
Oh, So what about her?
I just started it.
No, no, whoa!
You could do it.
I could.
Yeah.
Yeah!
A reel?
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Wait, I'll get you some air.
I'll be in the car, okay?
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
Come on. Inside.
Okay. We'll go for a ride.
Hi.
No, not really. Middle-class.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
Maybe upper-middle-class.
He is?
Yes.
He is.
He is.
Mm.
Yeah. So, what about you?
What about me? I don't have a car.
Oh, yeah?
Mm-mm.
Erica.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
It's nice to do a lot of things.
That's what I mean.
I'm not a nice guy.
I know. It's okay.
Yeah?
Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
I'm sorry.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
We were?
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
Funny shit, man.
Pony and I are friends.
Thank you.
Mm-mm.
Two-fifty? They go up?
Always two-fifty, my friend.
Uh-huh.
Nobody. Sooze.
Wow, that must be pretty nice there.
Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man.
Ask your girlfriend.
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
That chick, Erica?
Well, w-what happened?
I hit her.
Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
Oh, shit.
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
You don't know?
No.
Just put it down.
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
Is that Bee-Bee?
Come on!
Seven-twenty.
I gave it to you.
Look, your trespassing.
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
That's right.
Nazeer what?
Nazeer Chaudry!
You could've come over.
I know, I know, I know.
Yes.
Your sure as hell right about that.
So you can give me more shit?
About what?
Name one.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
One!
Your completely missing the point.
Hey!
I'm talking about idealism.
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
But do you stand for anything?
Yes, I stand for -
What? What do you stand for?
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
You know, all you know is what's good for you.
Typical male.
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
Tim!
Yeah.
I would've stopped it.
How?
Us.
And?
Come with me.
No one does nothing, Jeff.
Mm-hm.
No, I don't.
You do.
No, I don't.
No. No, no, no.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
Hey, where did you go? We were worried about you.
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
I, yeah.
Mm.
Is that a threat?
For a ride.
Wait, away?
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
To his hotel?
Shit, Jeff!
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
You're unbelievable.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Oh, fuck it, man!
Go.
What?
Just go.
Just go.
Good, man.
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Yeah, good.
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
So how's college?
What?
Yeah, they could be songs.
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Yeah, really.
Now?
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe later.  Hey! Hey!
For a while.
You know what I'm saying?
Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
Burnfield. No place like it.
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do.
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
No, this has everything to do with you.
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
Hey!
It's stupid.
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
Look at you!
Oh!
So? What's L.A. like?
It's pretty exciting.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Like?
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
You do not want me to do your cover.
I'm always serious.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Yeah.
Oh, no, man. I can't.
Alright!
You done?
I can't believe you're still here.
I'm moving.
If...
No, I'm going.
Mm-hm.
Yep.
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
That's because I am.
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
You do?
Oh, my god!
Really? What else does your mother say?
I think I gotta go.
Nobody's fucking anybody!
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
Yeah.
What are you going to do? Hm?
If you hit me...
Yeah?
Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
Yeah.
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
So where are you?
I'm here.
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Fucking drunk, huh?
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
No car.
The fuck not?
I just pulled and it - it came off.
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
You just became a statistic!
Cleo!
It's twins!!
Wayne Gretzky.
Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
No...I've been pregnant.
Positive.
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
Of course - of course!  Hands in...
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
I sure do.
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
I know, but that was before.
Oh... What are you working on?
Jus some girlie things for the squad.
We're here for you, Diane.
He is the Great One...
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
You sure I'm not fat?
We were told you could "fix us up."
He Ikea'd us.
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
Yeah, hold on.
Kim-Lo?
Wrong number  Nooooooo!
Bullets.
Kansas?
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate.  Where's my smokes?
I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
That's Itchy, alright.  How many y'need?
Hold up, hold up.  Any sentence that starts with "at church camp" ain't leading to the big "O."
But you're not married.
Uh...maybe?
Bank branch!
All of you!
I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
Before you?  Whoo-hoo!
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...
Action! The scene starts.
Let it ride for a while.
You're going to stay, aren't you?
That was the general idea.
Come on.
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
It's from hunger.
Nothing for Ladd?
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
So you take Plot 27-A, make it glossy, make it slick --
About that luggage.  Where's the phone?
Thanks.
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
Thank you.
How about the Rainbow Room?
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
Well....
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
With a wildly beating heart.
Life can be beautiful!
You don't know how glad I am to see youl
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
Into what? A lampshade?
I tell you this is half sold.
As a matter of fact.  I've given up writing altogether.
You sure have.
So long.
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
Nobody can be that busy.
You're tough, all right.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
Who's who?
Saddest thing I ever heard.
Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
It must be my new shampoo.
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
I just don't.
From Artie.  What's wrong?
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
You did.
You bet.
Whose house is it?
Whose?
Nobody asked you to.
Hello, Mr. deMille.
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
It's a good script, isn't it?
I knew there was something wrong with them.
Yeah?
You're a writer, you said.
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
And you'll play Salome?
Who else ?
This is fascinating.
Of course it is.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
December twenty-first.
I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
You can stay here.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
Just a scene I cut out.
What scene?
Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
They've come for my car.
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
I need some money right now.
Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
I've lost my car.
What's wrong with It?
Why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you to look nice, my stray little boy.
I don't need a tuxedo.
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
Come on!
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
Just follow me.
It's those feathers.  They tickle.
"Mad about the boy."
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again!
This is the right day.
They're awful.  They make me cough.
I ran into some people I knew.
Where are my cigarettes?
Where are your...?
All right.  Give me this.  I need it for a moustache.  Now close your eyes.
I think I'll read a little.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
Why do you say that?
No you didn't.  You took the car.
Of course you haven't.  I wouldn't let you.
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
You think I made that up about the gun...
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
No, they don't.
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
Wipe your feet!
Dressed for what?
Madame is waiting.
For me?  Okay.
It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
Is that so!
Who said you could?  Who asked you to?
That's what I told them.
Good.
There are no locks anywhere in this house.
The doctor suggested it.
You send them.  Is that it, Max?
I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
She is upstairs.
Right with you.
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
That's right.
What car?
Is that So?
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
Along is no good.  I need it now.
Haven't got a thing.
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
Was theft involved?  Did you catch him trying to steal something, or find he had stolen something?
Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
You know better than to interrupt me.
Paramount is calling.
Who?
Paramount studios.
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
Very good, Madam.
The cameras have arrived, Madame.
This is the staircase of the palace.
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.
He will be. In about five minutes.
No, a super girl.
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
Whatever you say.
Yes. Whatever I say.  From now on.
Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
Western Europe.
It's a warning, that's for sure.
Maybe it was just an accident.
It's for your own protection.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
I have to.
When can I see, you again ?
Who didn't?
I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
Let's talk about us, not her.
Tell me where I can find her.
I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.
Why not ?
We're from different worlds.
You don't like me? You hate me?
What do you feel about me?
Let me kiss you.
No.
You're not afraid are you?
Terrific.
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
Just like that?
Like turning off a light.
But why?
I sort of like what you said.
That makes it worse.
But I don't understand.
I'm not mad at you.
It seemed that way to me.
I don't see why not.
But what if---it wasn't real?
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
She'll forget about us eventually.
What?
How do I fight it?
Turn it against her.
Do you want to come to Argo City?
Well thanks a pile, fella.
Well, there's several ways to go .
Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
A passionfruit smoothee.
Well, just one.
What an adorable hat.
They think I have a concussion.
And you think you're in love.
I know it.
Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
Come back to my house. My car's outside.
I could force you.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
I've got things to do.
What about my proposal?
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
I knew it ! He's working on a  hot scoop !
Oh, no thanks.
The scoop of the year!
I can't help it if men notice me.
I heard stories.  I don't think you wanna know.
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
Why didn't you tell me?
You're supposed to guess.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
I allowed it to escape the City.
As brave as my father. As wise.
It's going to be a tree, I think.
Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this.
Can you create life?
This is all your clothes?
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
You're not...an orphan are you?
She's a beast.
Must've been a defective puck.
It was just a trim.
You sure?
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
Somebody's gotta do something!!
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
I'm Linda Lee.
No, MR. Danvers.
Sure. Mate in five moves.
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber.
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
I have to talk to you.
You're wasting your breath.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
No, that's not true---there's well...no--
I knew it!
But it's impossible.
Why?
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
Better than when I was a child.
Don't stop. Keep moving.
Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
Zaltar!
Buddy, are we in trouble.
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
There's no vodka in it.
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
What? What did you tell me?
Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!
A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
Too much mayonnaise?
Oh...I came close once.
I mean him.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
No, thanks.
Old ties are hard to cut.
Uh-huh.
Well, aren't you excited?
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
Oh. You're going away.
Kent!
Mom and I do this all the time.
What!
We get together sometimes.
Exactly what I was about to ask about me.
At one o'clock in the morning?
Gus Gorman.
What kind?
Kitchen. . . Technician
Dishwasher? Any luck?
Nope, but --
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
First paycheck?
They're just . . . floating around out there. The computer knows where.
One.  And a half.
Say what?
The boss wants to see you.
Say who?
Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
I don't think you understand.
Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
That what they call you?
Turn on the T.V.
I did. isn't it neat-o?
Uh...what channel were you watching?
What are you talking about, fella?
God, that's what I keep you for.
Greed!  Let me tell you something---
Huh?
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
Is this whitemail?
Fair's fair.
What do you want?
A computer.
We've already got some.
Everything.
What will it get me?
Anything.
Tell me more...
I told you it wasn't no jive.
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
We back in Metropolis?
Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
What she call you?
That's his sister. Vera Webster.
What about you?
Anytime.
Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
But the bridge...
I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
Tell me.
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
But the other night...
Hey, I know a lot of things!
So I understand from the graffiti I've seen.
Turn on the light.
Where's the light switch?
Where do you usually find a light switch?
But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
Because you're the Editor-in-Chief. Your integrity is unquestioned. LOIS I have a question.
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
Missing????
Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
Blizzards! Heat waves!
Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
TOMORROW THE OIL!
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
We can get to work on that oil!
Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Who needs Gus?
Don't bet on it!
Yeah. I'll check.
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
She'll be fine.
Do I detect a note of jealousy?
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
Be my guest.
In July???
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.
Lois, you're amazing.
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
Lois, I . . .
I was right. you are Superman.
Oh come on, that's ridic -
I'm listening.
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
Let's get you inside . . . .
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
I have to try, dammit! Something, anything . . .
Oh, hi.
Never closed my eyes.
Everything on it.
Does she know about it? She's in it!
What else is ballast for?
You'll have to pack quickly.
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
Your heart, Miss Teschmacher? I never knew you had one.
Is this a philosophy seminar? No. This is getaway.
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
I'll be alright.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
It's beautiful.
It's beautiful.
Wrong.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
What's a curl?
He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?
 DELETE IN CUTTING
North.
Why?
To ski?
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.
Constantly.
Australia.
The bomb! It's in there! Any second now, its --
Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home.  Until now.
Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
Cuba.
Put down Lex Luthor?
I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
Zod.  Zod.
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
Yes, but will you honor it?
Free!
What shall we do now?
Stay. I will come to you.
And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
We must combine our strength.
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
Oh, Clark, you're so delightfully primitive.
Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
What about here?
Don't worry, I've got you.
If you say so. Here goes.
Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.
Clark. . . !
No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
I'm sorry.
N-no...I mean...you bet.
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
Yes, darling?
Stuff it.
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
An angle?
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
Something . . . wonderful.
Our other dinner guest.
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
I must have miscalculated. How. . .
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
You're just an experiment, freako!
Hmm . . . Nuclear levitation. Now that's a trick that could come in handy.
This wasn't in the plan.
I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
You are . . . nothing. I am father now.
I made you, and I can destroy you.
Wait! Not yet! Back!
I am master now.
No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
Shut up, apple-polisher.
You're a great architect, Albert.
Thank you.
A hot story, huh?
It was hot, yes.
What's she doing in California?
I know.
I know son, I know...
North. It's north
I will.
Well!
No.
Not really, no.
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
But otherwise it's swell.
What the  --  !
He may have a gun!
Oh, for God's sake!
I just took a shot at it.
Huh?
Not unless you can fly.
Come again?
Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -
It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
Of this...Superman.
Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
Is that what they're calling him?
Besides that.
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
Okay.  Take me to your leader.
Even that would be an improvement.
First the pets, Otis.
He's from another world.
Tough guy, huh?
You're on.
I didn't say a word.
When it gets to seventy-five below, stabilize it.
Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.
What do you suggest, my dear?
Ready.
You?! How about me?
You have two minutes and thirty- two seconds.
Baby -- I'm going to take you higher.
Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
What are you going to do to him?
Lex is going bye-bye.
I'm wearing it.
I mean the other one!
What other one?
You can't do this to me!
Of course I can. I love you.
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
But so is Vond-El
If you persist, you leave us no choice.
Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
What's your name, boy?
He sure as heck does that.
I bless the day you came to us, son. You know that. But some people wouldn't understand.
Lara, please...
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
Well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
Then you have on of those 'feelings.' It was called: 'love.'
I guess I got carried away
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
No! You couldn't imagine -
How good it felt!
How good it felt -
Okay, but...why?  No offense.
You've got me? Who's got you???
Do as I say. Let go!
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
Not while I'm around you're not. C'mon...
Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
Right on the first guess.
Wha'...what are you doing here?
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
I guess they are a little odd.
It's not bad.
How old are you?
How much do you weigh?
195 pounds.
Can you really see through anything?
Uh-huh.
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
Do bullets really bounce off you?
Only when somebody shoots them at me.
Do you like pink?
Very much.
Where do you hail from?
Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
I gave him steady employment --
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
I gave him this new face.
Otis...
It is for me.
Will kill him! And I'm going to have a piece of the rock! Miss Teschmacher, pack your --
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
Oh, that. Listen  --  you're busy  --  and it's a long story --
No, Superman, of course not. You do get around, don't you.
Right, right. Where was I? Ah, yes --
And garbage doors.
Ally.  That was my nickname.
Ally.  That's right.
How are you?
I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
And what does he do again?
How is Mrs. Stephens?
We're...not together.
I'd heard that.  But she's well?
Yes...fine.
And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
Are you still in touch?
Which one?
Which clinic?
Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
She didn't.
But you said...
That's where I'm going.  To see her.
She's in trouble?
That's okay.
Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
Alison.
Say hi to Zoe.
I will.
I hope she gets better.
No you don't.
Not unless you can raise the dead.
Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...
They just finished supper.
Was it good?
Okay.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
Oh.  Right.
Goodnight, Nicole.
Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
The children.
She's resting.  In her room.
Say hello for me.
It does concern me.
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
Okay, fine.  So...stay out of it.
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
Can't you make it later?
A while.
No.  It should be dry by now.
When the game's over, I guess.
It's natural.
Your kids never cry.
I better get back.
Good night.
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
You believe that?
I have to.
Why?
Because I have to.
Well I don't.
What do you mean by that, Dolores?
About the Ottos?
Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
Do they have any reputation for drugs?

From what?
No.  I saw it on his face.
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
And what's that?
With our hands.
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
Did his parents attend to that?
What do you mean?
Did they give him special care?
Because I'd be to blame, right?
Yes.  He does.
Billy said that?
I did.
Excuse me?
Yes.
Anything you didn't understand?
Hi, Dolores.
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
You hate it.
I didn't say that.
I'll just strap it on the roof.
We've only got honey.
I'll...take it straight.
Summer's over.  It's fall.
And winter?
Well, winter's far behind us now.
Yes.  It's a present.
From you?
It's the truth.
No.
Jenny, it's time for you to go to bed.
That's what he said.
Yes.
What, Mason?
The people in the town?
Yes.
So he was mean?
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
Should I keep reading?
Yes.  Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and...
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
I don't want you to lie.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
I'm absolutely positive.
I object to that form of question. Note that.
Thank you, Nicole.
Will you be spending more than a night?
Hard to say.  I might have...some business here.
People who will help our cause.
No.
Tell me about it.
How old is she?
Almost three.
Is this it?
Perfect.
Here we go.
Thanks.
Yes.
Daddy?
Yes.
Don't you want to hear?
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
I tested positive.
Yes.
Welcome to hard times, Daddy.
What for?
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
Of...course I do.  I just thought...I could get you another
Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
Poached salmon.
Is there shrimp on it?
Yes.
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
I'm a lawyer.
You can't come here.
Please.
You've been retained?
Yes.
No.
No.
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
You remember that much?
As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.
Yes.
Yes.
Why were you scared?
Why were you scared?
Dolores was driving too fast.
You could see the speedometer?
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
Yes.
Why not?
There wasn't time?
Really?
You mean it?
Of course.
I am.  Really.  It was awesome.
Nothing.
The ramp?
Pretty slick, eh?
Very slick.
Do you like the colour?
It's okay.
Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
Oh.  I better get some spackle.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
As opposed to this T.V.?
No.
I don't know.
Will the police do anything to her?
There's talk of that.
You don't know that.
Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
Alone or surrounded?
Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
Yeah, having supper with the Mrs. She's over there.
Thanks, I see him...
I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
We're on our way there now...
Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
I only had a few hours.
Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
I see you're full of human feelings...
I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
Why, has he bothered you before?
Is it news to you?
No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
I'm afraid I can't cope with them.
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
Did Sidney tell you about it?
No, I'm not.  I'm not!
Who said Sidney?
I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -
Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
Susan!...
Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?  Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb.
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
Can I come in for a minute?
No.  You're dead, son - get yourself buried!
I have a message from your sister.
Everyone knows Manny Davis...  ...except MRS. Manny Davis.
Not just this minute, J.J....
I like Harry, but I can't deny he sweats a little.
You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?
He means that much to you...?
I read your column every day...
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
What does that mean - integrity?
Talk to her yourself...
I call him the boy with the ice cream face!
- He's got them on him.
Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
You're sure.  Find out for me.
Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?
At the bar - Sidney...
No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
...cigarette girls... And naturally -
And where was his wife?
That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
Can you be there by two-thirty?
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
Yeah!
This sort of thing!
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
- that's what I mean!
He wants me to break a leg?
But what?
The renting agent and the tailor.
Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.
Help me with two minutes of silence!
I hate to see you like this --
Take a top coat.
Nothing...
I know you do, Sidney.
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  It's cold out here, Susie.
Frank thinks I shouldn't have come here -
Why not you?
Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?
Did you now?  On which bounce?
See me in my office.
You tell him, I stutter!
Yes, but why?
Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -
If you're funny, James, I'm a pretzel!  Drop dead!
I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
No, you had me eating that Chinese food!...
Why did you call me?
Oh.  I can't, honey.  I'm on a roll here.
What chip?
Now listen to me very carefully.
Let me try mine.
No way!
Yeah?  Who sent you?
Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
Liquid metal.
Radical.
I would.
No.  Only an object of equal size.
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
You told me to.
That is one of my mission parameters.
Prove it... stand on one foot.
Of course.  I'm a terminator.
What?
Cool.
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
No problemo.
It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
No problemo.
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
Dyson.
Drive faster.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
Remember what I said, you can't...
Trust me.
Where you going?!
What?
Terminated.
Yes.  Throw it in.
I have to go away, John.
Don't do it.  Please... don't go --
I order you not to!
Where'd you learn all this stuff?
No!  Don't kill him!
It, John.  Not him.  It.
Alright, it!  We need it!
I love you, John.  I always have.
I know, Mom.  I know.
Go!  I'll finish here.
Ready.
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
Unknown.
So do you.
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
I have detailed files.
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
Can you get us in there, past security?
No.  There is another chip.
Yes.
On all what?
On Furtwngler.
I don't know.
Respect your elders and your betters!
And no elbows on the table!
Eating is eating... and...
I don't know.
I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
Some.
So, what does the Russki want?
So what is it?
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
David, what are you Counsel for the Defence now?  Did you hear the question?
and totally irrelevant.
Your manner.
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
We're dealing with degenerates here.
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
Let Furtwngler go. Please.
I have a duty.
Yes.
You do shorthand and typing?
Yes.
And your father was executed.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
What's in those files?
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
What's not right?
I don't buy that.
It's the truth.
Did you call someone you knew?
Sure.
Your guess is as good as mine.
I was warned.
Who warned you?
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
What did Goering say?
I wish to say something.
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.
Yes, von der Null.
Von der Null?
I have no idea.
What?
You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
Of course I know what that is.
Okay, so what is it?
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Who's conducting?
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Do you know what's in this archive?
How could I know what's in the archive?
Helmuth.
Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
How could I forget?
Show you?
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
Yeah?
One of my people?
Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
His private life?
I don't know what you mean, Major.
When you got to the crescendo.
Right. Claims assessor.
They said I was dogged?
Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
Come to the office, please.
You're late.
Can you handle it?
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
You know your weapons, buddy.
I'll do the same for you sometime.
Great.
You're a big help.
I hate the beige one.
I thought you did.
You must have a girlfriend.
That's none of your business.
Aha!  Is she young?
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.
No.  Not yet.  Not for about forty years.
Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
Come here.
White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
You like it?  It's my first.
Okay.  Talk some more.
About where you're from.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
What's that?
Why?
Fuck you!  Let go of me!
I want it to be over for you.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
Don't say that.
A girl.  You know.
No.  Never.
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
And so you feel nothing.
It's better that way.
Oh, Kyle.
Ticklish?
You'll beg for mercy in a second.
You're not supposed to.
Cover...our footsteps...
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Of course.
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
Who is in authority here?
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
They've already been identi- fied.  There's no doubt.
That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
I know.
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
Send a unit.
I just called.
Call her again.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat...
Admittedly...
But, the expectation was ten.  And, in this case, expectation is everything.
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
Then, you kiss his ass.
I apologized, I offered to help.
Clean out your locker.
Please, don't do that...
Oh, no... you.
Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
I don't know... he fell.
I don't think he's breathing.
Don't just stand there, get help!
This can't be real...
He's turning blue!
What <u>is</u> your problem?
Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.
What... is... happening... ?
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
You should be.
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
Where are you going?
Home.
How thoughtful.  The gift of inconvenience.
Why not?
You first.
My hero.  Let's go.
What's C.R.S.?
Consumer Recreation Services.  It's their building.  They...
Yes... well...
You're the one who started running.
Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
That one did.
... two hundred dollars a toe.
Nicholas Van Orton?  What are you, a czar?
Why... ?
That tall, bright building.  Near there.
Investment banking.  Moving money from place to place.
Hm?  Oh, yes.
I don't spend much time looking out the window.  I'll call you a taxi.
Right.  Call me Christy.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
Can we talk?
It's okay, dad.
Is this you?
Where'd you get this?
Okay.
I thought...
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay?  Be right back.
You?
Wha... ?
Not here!  They can see.
Nicholas...
God, wake up, it's a con!
Get out.
Then, what good are you?
They did the same to him as they did to you.
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
I didn't say anything.
Who the fuck cares?
It might be best if we didn't talk.
All I mean is... someone like you...
How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
Scams, con games.  How many?
I don't know.  A lot.
What do we do?
It's out of your hands.
Nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...
Nicholas...
Get us out!
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
You call them...
Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you...
... what... ?
Where'd you get that gun?
It's mine...
We searched the house.
Guess you missed it.
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
Nicholas...
You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
Please, Nicholas, let me show you...
I have to show you...
No!
Claire.  Pleased to meet you.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Like... where are you from?
Originally, Connecticut.
Big family... small?
One brother, one sister.
Studied acting, I assume?
Julliard, yeah.
Single?
Yes.
Boyfriend?
No.
Underwear?
Always.
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
Happy Birthday, man.
That's why it's a classic.  Come on, man... how 'bout a hug... ?
They'll be wanting it back.
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
You need anything?
No.
Really?
You shouldn't have.
Trust me.  Call that number.
Why?
It's a profound life experience.
Like a stroke?
Call them.  Trust me.
Okay.
Will you?
I said I would...
But, will you?
Are you still on mediction?
Why would you say that?
It doesn't matter...
Do it for YOU.
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
What's this all about, Connie?
Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
You dodged a bullet.
How do you mean, exactly?
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
You think I know?  I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
How do you know?
Really?
What?  Connie...
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Yeah.
Split it?
It always is.
Yes.
I hope.
I'll call.  I really will.
I know.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
A game?
It's different every time.
Humor me with specifics.
We provide whatever's lacking.
May I make two suggestions... ?
An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
Nobody knows, pal.  Nobody gets the big picture...  Jason, Tommy, cut it out!
How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.
They own the whole building.  They just move from floor to floor.
No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
I don't want money.  I'm pulling back the curtain.  I'm here to meet the wizard.
Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail.
It was a different floor then...
Like, this way... sort of...
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
Don't take another step.
First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
Have we met?
Hm?
Is there a room key?
Didn't I give you two?
No, you didn't...
Have a nice day.
Thank you.  Goodnight.
Well... send my love, if you see him again.
Fine.
Ilsa... you're alright?
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
I'm just like him.
Nobody worried about your father.
Goodnight.  Where was she?
What's this about?
No.
The Hinchberger wedding.
A Mister... Seymour Butts.
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Why are you following me?
Friend... why don't you back off.
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Don't ask.
I checked it personally.
Follow me.
It was a misunderstanding.
Nothing else?
What about the house?
Attempted murder.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
Greetings fellow sheep counter.
And what kind of sleeper?
Well, I... uh...
Who's Watts?
Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
I did okay.
Yeah.
There's a carriage house around back.
You get your money.
Just stay there, Nell!
Luke.
You could have.
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
Yeah.
You want company?
Maybe someday.
Where in the hell can she be.
You don't believe in the paranormal.
No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
Does she know that's why you're using her?
I, I just can't...
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
Well... we're glad to have you.
That smell... oh, God.
It was very specific.
What happened after you smelled it?
Yes.
And then what happened?
I got more scared.
No you're not.  Something moved you.  You saw something.
It was a stupid thing to do.
Welcome Home.
Why?
I don't know.
Nell.  You will come here now.
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
No --
How'd I know it was for you?
That?  That's Hill House.
This is where we're going?
Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
Mary came with me.
It's okay... we're all here...
Nell, what do we do?
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
Who?
Yes.
She was unhappy.
Why?
So far.
I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
No one will come any nearer than that.
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
What did it cost?
Fifteen dollars.
It's all I could afford.
I don't know what you mean.
What do you do?
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
I know.
The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?
No.  The world has missed you.
You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
David.
No, it's getting worse.
Maybe you did it yourself.
Why?
Just think about one thing right now: What color?
Red.  What else?
I think so.
Okay.
I do.
Just had to be sure.
Then let's go get you one.
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
Not for you, clearly.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
Am I a thing?
Well, you're certainly not a person.
I'm not.
It's not a compliment.
As soon as you get dressed.
What kind of food?
Anything but Japanese.
Why?
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
Oh, god.
I'm sorry.
Italian.
Who?
We all did.
I'm a gracious host.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
We think?
Why not?
Because --
Come over here.
Not bad.
Where do we go?
When you find the guy, you'll know.
There's been some trouble downtown.
What kind?
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
We'll find him.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
Well, can we make it one more.  Nowhere the fuck near me.
Let him break - he likes to break.
I wouldn't talk.
Huh?
You're in gun country now, my friend.
Been to the Boat Show.
Lookin' good.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
Yes, sir.  Won't find a better CQC on the market.
Eduardo.  Rama.
You're home, then.
No reason.
Huh?
Y'what?
She didn't write to me, did she.
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
Not me, man.
Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
Who'd you butcher at the house?
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
Has he?
See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
No one else is even here yet.
First in, first out, that's me.
Faith.
One thing I need.
Too easy?
He's gotta know why.
Again?
Not much -- you?
Same.
Didn't get it.
Well, those are the breaks.
Hell, no.  I started writing.
You look alike.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Not her brand.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
No, why did you come here?
Been busy, have you.
How d'you mean?
It's been a while.
What was that, then?
Try calling me again.
Here, are you always this sarky?
Now who's being sarcastic?
Ashamed.
Not ashamed.
She never told Eddie, though.
She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
Something like that, yeah.
Where you get your bank statements.
-- Mr. Lindgren.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
My employer.
What line is he in.
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.
Are you serious.
What do you think.
On what.  What makes you so certain.
I'll bloody well ask him.
There's the phone.  You want his number.
You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?
Tell us about it.
Hey?
From pursuing your chosen profession.
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
Get seven years, did you?
Overnight.  What about just now?
Just now?  Overnight?
It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
Pushing the legal limit even then.
Only in the movies.
I've 'ardly ever left it.
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
What about your grandmother?
Black market during the war.
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Won't he be looking for you about now?
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
I fiddle it.  They got me down as an immigrant with five kids.
Up the coast.
How far?
What's in Big Sur?
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
How do you know?
Bloke told me.
So what's your beef, pal?
Eh?
Of the deal, man.
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
What am I doing?
He had urgent business in the north.
Ian?
That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there.
No kidding.
You're a reluctant traveller, then.
Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
Where else?
Could do, yeah.
Five thousand.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Yeah.
Which kind?
The forever kind.
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
The L.A.P.D.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
That don't mean nothin'.
So what.
And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
Any happier than any other asshole in life.
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
Something's on.
What?
You bet.
Like what.
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
Walked.
What do you think?
What are you doing here?
Exercising my visitation rights.
Since when?
I miss my kids.
I don't want you here, Terry.
Sure you do.
-- You know his name is Frank.
Is he here?
You know I don't live with him.
Who's looking for you?
Go now.
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
You must know Ian.
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
Tell me.
Tell you ...
Ann. Will you come in?
Yes. Thank you.
And you should tell Doris...
Hello, Birdy.
We've certainly missed you.
That's what he keeps telling me.
He didn't say that.
But more or less.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally.
You're an enthusiast.
Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
It's OK...
Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--
No. Uh... family friend.
Ah yes, a music lover.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
Well? How'd she do?
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
I can get it, yeah.
No. I--tell me--
Sure.
Maybe.
You're out of line, mister.
Yeah.
Cash.
Cash?!
Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...
OK. Take your coat, Ann?
No, Dave, I wasn't.
She's a rare one.
How's business, Dave?
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
What is it, Dave?
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
But it's...
Please, Ed.
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
Big Dave--
Just coffee.
I, uh... thanks.
Mm.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
Oh, don't be a grump.
Who?
Dave.
How's that?
Ahh...
Congratulations, Gina.
How are you?
What happened to you?
You don't have to tell me anything.
I... just knew. A husband knows.
I don't know. I don't think so.
How did you get into the store?
I took Doris's keys.
Oh, hell. Drink?
No thanks.
Sure you don't need one?
I'm fine.
OK. Boy. Jesus!
Taking it seriously.
So, who should I--
I'm fine. Thanks.
No thanks, honey.
Yeah, the best.
I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
I don't work here. My wife does.
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
Yeah.
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
I know who you are, Mr Crane.
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
How d'ya like them apples?
Huh?
Russians exploded an A-bomb.
Yeah.
Jesus...
Yeah, yeah--go home.
Huh?
This hair.
Yeah.
What the hell are you talking about?
OK.
You don't got a headache?
...Nah.
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
The hell with it, Eddie!
Huh? No.
What'd he say?
Hello, Walter.
Crane. Ed Crane.
Yeah--
Hello.
We're just closing, friend.
Could you come with me please?
Sure. Can Ed come too?
Second chair.
Not an owner.
Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya.
Under arrest for murder.
He said OK. Is that what he said?
It better be good.
I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
Someone broke into this room.
Anything missin'?
You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
Behind you.
What's the combination?
Calm down.  I found it!
Let's go!
Like hell!
Where the hell are you?
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?
What's left of it.
Mind if I have a look?
Where's the head?
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
Call me Vince.
Unfortunately, no.
Apparently it's huge.
I think I should come with you.
This door's locked.  Try shooting the hinges off.
The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
May I see that?
This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
Dr. Green has to see you!
Got my hands full here.
I know.
You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.
Oh shit.
All right everybody, hold up!
Dr. John Whittlesley.
What's that doing here?
I'd say we're in its home.
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
Right.  The entire brain appears to have been extracted.  May I see it, please?
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
You must.
What are they?
They're eggs.
Don't stop now.
We will.
Look who's here, Margo.
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
You said you had plans of the museum.  Could we see them, please?
Footsteps!
They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
Yes, I do.
What do you do?
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
What is it?
Not that big.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
You're color blind.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
Not yet.  Let's try the fork to the left.
Keep the light up.  I can't see.
Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!
Holy mother, what is that?
Get back!  Now!
Quiet.
Another storage room.
Keep the animal quiet.
What?
Frock's been fired.
What's that?
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
There's another possibility.  A lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage.
It's reptilian.
Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
How about lunch?
You have time to talk?
How did you know that?
A monster?
I don't know.
Behind me.  Over there.
All right.  If you're positive.
No.  I think I'm hallucinating.
Wounded?
The planetarium!
Vince!
What are you going to do?
It's scared of me.
I think... it means it's full.
Then it won't go after the others?
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
Oh God!  Help!
It's coming.  Run.
I have to shoot.
Do it, quickly.  Please.  Aim for the eye.
You have to.  Do it now!
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
<i>Fiji.</i>
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
Viti Levu.  For how many?
One.
It's the busy season.
I thought you were in a hurry.
You want to book the flight?
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
What's on the ClockCam?
He gave it back to his father.
It's just a matter of time.
Why would we--
Sweep the harbor.
What music?
<i>Storm</i> music...Wagner...
Do it!
Thank you.
Of course.
I prefer to think of it as a mirror.
Certainly a nomination.
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
I'm the creator.
You're the star.
Shhh!
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
Sure she would.
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
Lauren, right?
That's right.  Lauren.
--I'm not allowed to talk to you.
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
You have a boyfriend?  Of course you do.
Saturday?
Now.
If we don't go now, it won't happen.
I think I've studied enough.
I...I can't.
Yeah?  Outta what?
Sorry, I'm way behind.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
I think I'm mixed up in something.
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
I've got to show you something.
This is where it started.
What exactly?
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
It's a surprise.
They're...  perfect.  Thank you.
Did something happen today?
I've been thinking--
Oh, God.
Every time you and Marlon--
That can wait.  I want to get away.  See some of the world.  Explore.
I think I'm going to stay up for a while.
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
I made macaroni.
I'm not hungry.
I still want to look over a couple of things.
See you in a minute, sweetheart.
What's the hurry?
Oh, my God!
What do I do?
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
You're upset because you want to go to Fiji.  Is that it?
What?!
So why do you want to go?
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
You blaming me for the traffic?
Uhuh.  There's no accident.  It's just more stalling.
I bet you did.
I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
I've tasted other cocoas.  This is the best.
You're part of this, aren't you?!
You're the one talking to the walls!
Well, I made it through another night.
How's your hip?
I feel certain my condition runs in the family.  Can't this wait, dear?
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
Sure.  Okay.  Fine.  Can you pass on a message?
You got it.
Fine.  I'll tell her.
The whole area's being evacuated.
Well, thank you for your help.
You're welcome, Truman.
Who?
There's no one here.
You must listen.  Everybody's pretending, Truman.
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
You can count on it.
Yeah.
We don't even know you.
Well, we're FBI agents.
You're not FBI agents.
Yup.
A woman?  Work.
Me?
Yes. I know.
Agent Mulder.
Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
Is it an emergency?
Kurtzweil, we think.
I'm looking for him.
Looking for him for what?
Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
No. Just fossils, far as I know.
I know the name. Why?
That's what I'm saying.
Do you?
Not according to the men in blue.
You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
You can't.
I'm not sure. A virus --
-- You saw this experiment?
Your guess?
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
I've been using you?!
You didn't know my father --
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
I'm on the roof.
Did you find something?
No. I haven't.
What's wrong, Scully?
It's locked?
No you didn't.
Oh yeah. Had you big time.
Scully, I found the bomb.
Where are you, Mulder?
I'm in the vending room.
Nice try, Mulder.
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
-- Mulder! Get in the car!
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
No.
Why not? It's three AM.
I was until about an hour ago.
Get dressed, Scully.
Mulder -- what are you doing?
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
And you're looking for?
I can't really talk right now.
What did you find?
What kind of infection?
I don't know.
Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
It looks pretty green for this climate.
No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
And where are they going with it?
Where would they be going?
We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
I don't know why I think they went right.
-- of what exactly?!
Mulder --
It may be extraterrestrial.
Very weird.
Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
For the purpose of what?
Run.
Come on!
I don't know.
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
You can't quit, Scully.
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
Just like that --
I think... something stung me.
No -- it's --
Where are we?
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
General McAddie's.
Well, call General McAddie.
I don't have his number.
-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
Where's Scully?!
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
I don't know.
I've got to find Scully.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
He's come and gone.
I have answers for you.
Is she alive?
No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
My life is over.  Go.
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
No, you need only take away what is most precious to him.
A pocketful of rye...
Four-and-twenty blackbirds.
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
Lucien Baines?
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
Someday you can.  We all believe that...
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
Shush.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
No.
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
Why did we stop?
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
He needs to be turned over.
She said convincingly.
What happened?
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Baked in a pie.
What's wrong?
I don't need them anymore...
I know.
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
...give a kiss to Edward.
Give a kiss to Edward.
How hard could it be...?
You don't know the procedure.
I know him.
Do you think that's funny?
Peter, okay?
What did you see?
You're the shrink, you tell me.
I did, yeah.
Evil.
If you believe that.
What happened to Charles Gish?
What difference does it make...?
Tell me.
Yes.  I am.
Little boy?!  That's him!
Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
I can't leave him!
Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
Absolutely.  Abigail...
Good for them.
No.  Thank you.
He's beautiful...
's broken.
Mocky-Lock.
Oh no... No you don't.
That hoist, with the winch...
They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
What's wrong?
Sometime yesterday morning.
I'll get her...
Yes.
Absolutely.
Any psychiatric medication?
No.
What about narcotics?
No.
I doubt that.
Dr. Kent.
You're looking well.
What about the cat?
Completely unaware.
Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.
Now?
Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
She remembers because it was her "dream truck."  Wanted one just like it.
What else do we do?!
But you looked so cute.  All sleepy...
Considering where I've been...
You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing with Timothy Leary.  I don't care.
Ja, ja, ja.
Das worren nooh zeiten.
They think you did it.
Sit down.
No, no...oh...excuse me.
No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea?
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
He has a little dog.
Oh, yes, yes.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
Yes.
Were you at the inquest?
Mmmm.
I was told there were only two men there.
They're forged.
Why?
Whiskey.
Silly looking bunch.
Need we go through it all again?
Just another part I've got to learn.
In German?
Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
Well you read this.
What's that?
"Ein hurigan" - I guess.
Tell you what?
Where is she?
Tell me more.
Anna.
It's just what he used to say.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
Holly.
I'm so sorry.
It's all right.
Yes.
What's the matter?
I wish I knew.
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
Me.
Why?
A parrot...Let it go.
Have you seen Calloway?
He told you, didn't he?
Oh...
I'm sorry.
Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
I shall be all right.
He's safe in the Russian zone.
How do you know?
His.
Oh, well.
Why are you lying?
We're getting you out of here, aren't we?
Thank you.
Keep the packet.
Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.
Yes.
That's the reason.
I have never seen him.
No.
They'll be returned, miss.
They are - private - letters.
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
Just around the corner.
How will I know you?
This is forgery. It is very clever.
Thank you.
Can I have that woman's passport?
Fellow called Lime.
Martins.
You a friend of Lime's?
Yes.
Been here long?
No.
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
Once in a while.
No, sorry.
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
Him dying like that.
Best thing that ever happened...
What are you trying to say?
He was...
Ever seen one?
Pin it on a...
Well, you could say that murder was part...
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
Getting around, Martins.
Oh, pinning things on girls now.
Calloway.
You're not locking her up?
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
In Vienna...
Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
Bring him in.
I can't. He disappeared...
I'm not asking you to.
Thank you. Excuse me.
This is where he vanished.
I see.
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Fifty yards right down there.
Which side of the road?
She's right. It's none of my business.
You all did.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
Win what?
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
Well, there's not much time.
One can't just leave - please.
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
No, no. Leave them for a while.
Oh, Mr. Martins...
Do you know his number?
No, I don't know...
I'll look it up for you.
Well, look, is there a car here I can use?
I know a very good dentist.
Heard of Harry Lime?
Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
What is it, Sergeant?
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
Who?
Never heard of him.
Very popular. Are you staying long?
Excuse me, have you got tooth...
Yes.
Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
It's good to see you, Holly.
She's been arrested.
Holly...
I told the police.
And - Anna...
Did the police believe you?
You can get somebody else...
Do you expect me to give myself up?
Outside of your stories...I've got to be careful.
I wish I could get rid of this thing.
What did you expect me to be - part of your...
What do you want?
Zwei zwartze.
At the end of every chapter --
What did he say?
But he said he died instantaneously.
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
What's the name of this girl?
But you will.
The Roumanian?
How do you do.
Vinkel.
Coming to the point, please.
Thank you.
I have guests waiting.
Hear the details.
Not necessarily.
English?
Who?
Mr. Lime's.  Accident...
Must be some mistake.
Yes, sir.
You remember me? Upstairs...
Yes, yes, I remember you.
What does he say?
You saw it?
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
Who else?
Yes.
The Roumanian?
Yes.
And?
You don't mean that doctor?
I am not a bad man.
Something wrong.
What else?
He didn't want to get involved.
Joseph Harbin.
Joseph Harbin? No...no.
A novel, Mr. Martins?
Not when I get interested.
Yes.
Never.
Oh.
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
His name?
Okay.
Yes?
I'm Daffy.
Richard. Hi.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.
Good morning.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
We moved rooms because of him.
There is one problem.
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
So how many miles do you think it is?
I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
We're ok.
I think we're about half way.
What!
A fin!
Yes.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
A bit fucking late.
What happened?
Fuck off.
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
But he has been there, off course.
It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.
Richard?
Eh - bonsoir.
Not too bad.
We swim.
Swim?
No.
One night I will get the perfect photograph.
It's just the sky, Richard.
Where did you lose it?
What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.
The Zionists aren't Nazis.
They had Sabra and Shattila.
He's an asshole.
Who the fuck are you?
Then I won't bring you....
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
I don't, but...
Let's look at the fucking thing.
Why the fuck not?
Just don't.
You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
You will.
Maybe I am. Maybe we're all Jews now. What's the difference?
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
Too difficult?
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Abstraction. They're obsessed with abstraction.
I just read it....
You want it to be an event.
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
Killing himself.
That's stupid. Why would they?
Yes, I am. Basically I am.
Bigger and better.
Then how come you're talking to me?
Why won't you talk to me?
I'm talking to you right now. Who's Linda?
You can't.
He's at a home out here.
I stole it. From a synagogue.
What do you care?
I'm good at languages.
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
It looks a little like a swastika.
With you there's a tragic dimension.
Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...
V'asitem...
Don't curse in front of it.
You shouldn't.
I told you, I'm good at this.
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
You want a punch in the mouth?
I don't know. I just want to try it.
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
No. What are you looking for?
You don't own this place.
I didn't realize you cared.
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
I'll go look....
Who's Eichmann?!!?
What'd you say?
Nothing. Let's go....
I'm stealing it.
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
Obviously.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
Notice? Like what...?
I don't know. Is that right?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Everybody likes to, don't they?
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
Those aren't Jews.
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
So you're saying it's not true.
Look at me.  DO I look Jewish?  Look...
Why would Nadelman lie?
Does that mean you deny what he says is true? Yes or no.
No.
How do you reconcile the two?
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
The arguments, anyway.
To hear them read Torah.
I thought you hated Torah.
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking.
This is me.
How did you...?
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
It was a nine millimeter.
You're lying.
Think about your father. Your sister.
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
Fucking kike.
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
You do it on the inside....
Don't tell me what I --
Yes!
Daniel Balint.
Balint?
It's German.
From the Rhineland originally.
Ilio Manzetti...former ambassador to France. Managing partner at Damon, Schwarzchild.
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
Fine.
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
That's meat.
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
Steve's going to explain it.
Tell it to Hitler.
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
You can heat them up and eat with him.
A Jewish prayer.
Number ten.
Get out of here....
The mother.
What...?
Here...
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
Christ...
You said they didn't have night guards.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
Mrs. Moebius.
Why? Why would she?
So what do we do with the device?
I have an idea....
Just do it.
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
Are you an artist?
Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
Four. But no one this important.
I can tell....
How?
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
What are you trying to say?
What do you think you should have done?
Do I give a shit?
Exactly.
Dennis Leary.
Leary?
No.
Obviously.
Funny?
Not like Mr. Dorfmann.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
Just a little... What's the difference?
So what?
They're not that Jewish.
Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?
I was just trying to make a point. If --
Danny, please, we don't want to know.
And let us say...
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
Does he know?
No.
Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
... You take care of yourself, Johana.
Johana, am I boring you?
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
... So am I.
The mafia!  La Cosa Nostra!
The documents are forged.
No!
Italian is practically the same thing.
Hello!
Yes.
Enzo Molinari.
In a lake.
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
Don't you agree, Jacques?
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.
Enzo!
Checking out the competition.
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
What else is there?
You know what I'm talking about.
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
I won't, I swear.
You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
Don't.
Why?
That idiot!
Lira?
Dollars.
Six seconds.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Then tell him to wax it too.
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
A rosary for Mama, a dress for
"That"!  This is not a "that"...
He's training.
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
It isn't lit yet.
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
... What's your name again?
Noireuter.
I didn't say...  Brussels!
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
Try speaking to me?
I dove 315 feet!
Great!
What room have you got?
I don't have one.
Not at all!
You're staying at the hotel?
What?
Your mother?
... And his friend, Johana...
Get in the car!
Then, it's very chic.  Avanti!
... For the mermaids.
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
Why?  Are they what's most important?
Everything about what?
Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
What is it?
Yes.
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
Thank you, thank you very much!
No!  I would never cheat you.
Well that's very nice of you.
... I was right about what?
I can't.
Jacques, take me back down... Please.
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
Does anybody live to make a second?
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
Tea... or whiskey?
No... in the hut.
Thank you.  I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
... Okay.  I'll try.
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
I'm being a pain in the ass.  It's beautiful here.
It's too loud for me.
Thank you...
... Especially the sneakers.
Lucky I was there to save you.
You jumped in?
I'd better get back now.
No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!
I don't know, I just feel it.
Uh... Yes, of course!
I did?
Why?
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
It's me... Johana.
I got fired.
I'm still here.
Well, then, talk to me some more.
Uh... Ah!  A story?
It's me again.
... Not at all.
You sure?
Absolutely positive.
I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis.
I didn't dive.
You'll try again tomorrow?
... Nothing.
You go back, I'll walk.
You want to lie down for a while?
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
I saw how it has to be.
Anything.
Promise you won't forget me.
Positive, Sir.
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
What?
Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
I brought Johana to meet you.
Johana... New York.
In my apartment?
It's my apartment.
The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
Louis, we were French!
That's different!  What's the matter with you?
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
They're going to send detectives.
What?
How was your trip?
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
Okay... Who'd you meet?
Haven't you been listening?
No.  I'm just depressed.
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
Of course, that's what they're for.
Yes... It's magic.
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
In the spring when he melts!
But... how is he going to breathe?
... Yes?
Let him sleep.
What's up?
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
My Esther! Oh Mordechai.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
I know sir. I won't let you down.
It's Esther.
Please, call me Mordechai.
Sure. Why not.
I said, do you come here often!?
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
Yes Esther.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
Mordechai!
Mordechai!
Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
...I'm not finished yet, mom.
Happy Hanukkah Morty.
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
He's still working out some identity issues.
Take a look.
Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
No, it was the perfect level.
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Take a look.
It's Friday.
That depends. How much money has he?
Mmmyes.
Nice fellow?
I don't know -
What about me?
You get your money from your husband.
If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
I sleep it off.
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
And my leopard - - maybe he hurt the first girl -- but no more.
Let's get in your truck.
Up at the museum.
No. I'm serious about this.
Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
What do you want to see him for?
I want him to lock me up.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
I don't know. I want him to lock me up.
You found the leopard!
Where? Where did you find it?
All men are fools. They like to make a big show - shout and hunt --
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
Let me see it 
Tomorrow -
Rosita  I have wondered -
What, senorita?
I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
I'll miss you too, honey --
I want to ask you something.
You're worrying about its killing someone else?
Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
We're old friends.
More or less.
Yes.
Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
No.
It was you.
Not! I tell you. No!
Tell me.
That was a calamity!
Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone 
Something's wrong with this whole setup --
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Why?
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
Now look what you've done.
And I suppose you don't feel bad!
We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!
And not a sign of the leopard?
Yes.
That doesn't make sense.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
Absolutely sure.
I got into a little crap game.
That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways 
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Will you please come with me?
That might depend on where youre going.
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
Im afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
You wouldnt recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
That depends what youre looking at.
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Can it be that easy?
Can it be that you want your brother found?
Disney! How inter...
Theres more. Your brother also purchased a young boy for 15,000.
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
I cant tell you that yet. But hes being well looked after.
Oh no. Youll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
Perhaps I should come back when youre...
Couldnt Nazi hunters do the job?
Im impressed. That information could have cost me 20,000.
Have you got a pen?
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
...7548. Have you... Have you found him yet?
Yeah. Goodnight, Mrs De Moraes.
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
When did you get back?
Youre repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
Sorry?
You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?
My brother hung himself.
Think what you like. But dont presume to understand.
Good.
Is there anything to understand?
Why do I feel I neednt answer that?
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
...Were turning in circles.
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?
Something like that?
Something like that.
Where is that?
Simplify and damn.
Dont you believe in simplicity?
Should I?
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
I dont know. Everyones dead...
Your parents arranged the visit to my office?
The dead can wait.
Can you tell me how you spell...
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
Croissants.
Europe...  France. Im French but I live in London...  ... England.
Youre a long way from home...
I dont smoke. If you could get to the point...
Im fine standing, thank you.
Yeah.
I know where to look.
Right... Well, Ill get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Do you know a friendly cop?
Its up to you whether they walk or not.
I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex- husband?
Have we done business before?
This is a bad line.
So, what are you looking for?
What about an untrained pup, white...
How much of a hurry are you in?
Have the money ready by 11am. Well call you.
What...?
You... Fuck you!
Yes. Friedmans the fuckin Austrian!
Where is he?
Who?  Martin... Hes Martin...
No... No...  I swear...
Where?
What?
Where are we?
Finsbury Park. Were in Finsbury Park.
What kids?
The company. We all work for the company.
Just me...  Martins gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
Where is it?
Downstairs... At the front... Jesus...
Can I have the reception desk, please.
I certainly did, sir...
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
Its Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
Bye bye, Jane. And dont be naughty.
Yes. How did...
Thank you, Jane.
What if it is?
Recommended?
Do what, Mr Lombard?
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
I presume you checked your sons apartment...
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
My rates...
Plus a trust fund to provide for the boys education.
We conclude our transaction.
Does it matter?
Is my money in there?
Uh-huh. You couldve waited for me inside.
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
No. In Hampstead... Why?
Dont jump any red lights.
Shut up and drive!
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Could someone have hurt you that bad?
Dying without ever reaching the top...
Hyatt... Friedmans... at the Hyatt...
The Hyatt...? Whats that?
Three oclock.
Le Mercury. Newman street. Ask for Peter.
I dont recollect mentioning a friend.
Wheres your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
Shut up! Wheres your wallet?
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
Should I be?
Can I get up now?
Did Leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved, Rhian?
Albert... Albert and Ethel. Why?
Is she on the phone?
The nineteenth... How come you didnt know?
Ive been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
Fine...
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Excuse me?
I take it you dont know where he is, then?
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You dont know Leon, do you?
What about which girlfriend?
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pr- pubescents.
Viens.
Mon bureau cotait trop cher.
Who?  I dont know who the fuck youre talking about, sunshine.
Fuck...
Three...
Glucks dead, you sonofabitch!
Huh! Youve been around, eh?
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
So why didnt he?
What do you think, huh?
I can only tell you what he told us...
Shut up and walk...
Its a good guess...
Costliest!
Whats that? A word?
What do you think?
Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
What do you mean?
Of course I am, it's just that...
Good.  Until then, feel free to live like a king!
Louis... water and fresh straw!
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
Better today than tomorrow.
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
They've started the battle without me!
No, it's... it's nothing, it's...
Come with me...
Jeanne, no...
So... what am I supposed to do now?
What... what do you mean?
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
You make it sound so simple...
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
To be killed in battle?
It would not be the same without you.
Not yet!
Do as I say!
I want to stay with you...
That's an order!
I -- I don't understand...
One day you will.
Jeanne, you can't leave us like this!
Good.
Sound the retreat...
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
I don't know, but you're all men of the church... why not ask Him yourself?
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
Quite a few.
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
To avoid killing anyone.
No, I... I held it up to...
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...
Performing a miracle.
Rouen is in English territory.  I have the right to do anything I like.  Take them away.
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
Dead you're worthless, darling.
Where... where am I?
Guess.
And God who allowed you to be caught?
What about you?
But where are you going to be?
I'll be right here... I promise.
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
How old are you?
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
Were you baptized?
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
Not unless you hear my confession.
When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
What did it tell you?
Many things...
You have nothing to regret...
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
Thanks be to God.
And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
I'm... I'm not the king...
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
Does he have hair?
Yes.
That's not a lot.
I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
Yes... they were.
Everywhere.  Where is the food?
He's on the other side of the river.
For what?
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
Sooner is better than later!
The wind will be with us!  Do as I say.
We're taking back the Tourelles!
I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
We need another ten minutes...
The bridge won't wait!
Not yet.
The English won't wait.
Good idea...
No good?  This is a disaster!
But the bridge has been pulled down!
The English are rebuilding it.
Perfectly.
No... not like this...
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Reinforcements?  Where??
Never look behind -- only ahead!
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
The clothes are not important...
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
Why not?  He has good teeth...
Because... because you just can't!
Here -- take this instead.
Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
Sorry Jeanne...  Did you both meet already?
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
Not for long...
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
If you kill him, you kill me!
Who gave you that horse?
My king.
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
Playing...
I -- I -- I...
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
Nothing.  I'm here to set you free...
I might ask you the same question.
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
I told you already... I'm here to set you free...
Why?  Are you waiting for someone else?
Who?
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
Because... I have to be alone!
What do you mean, they won't come?
Why would they?
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
Do you think this cross will protect you?
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
Are you sent by God?
Yes, my lord.
Let's see.
I need to confess again.
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
My father's.
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
Yes, it is.
He never says his name.
What... does he... look like?
Only God knows the answer to that.
I want to be with him always...
Who wants me to stop?
It's like this... I...we...all of them.
Yes.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
He's still a doctor.
No one plays Chopin like you.
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
Dorota.
Come in! come in!
He'll be back before curfew.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
Just over a year.
Dead.
What are you doing?
Let's find out.
I'll be fine.
What's happened?
What, I'm working, what?
They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
What?
Funny time to say this.
What?
wish I knew you better.
Thanks.
I haven't seen him.
Can you help?
It costs.
I've no money.
Who told you?
What d'you mean, take the table away?
Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
Warsaw's not the only radio station.
That makes a change.
You know what we do? We use psychology.
Just shut up.
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
That's better than yesterday.
What did you pay him?
They were taking you away.
That's also my business.
You'll be deported.
Yes, that's why I brought it.
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
But I want to help, I want to.
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Can you help? I've no money...
Please, don't insult us.  Can you do something for him?
Wladek! How are you?
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
Pig!
Bitch!
Dirty pig!
You're a dirty pig!
Takes one to know one! Pig!
Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!
Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
I've been worried sick.
Where are we going?
Out of Warsaw.
Out of Warsaw. Where?
I'm not going anywhere.
No, I don't think so?
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
I am... I was a pianist.
A pianist.
Show me.
We're getting out.
Not yet.
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
Watch your feet!
Watch his hand
Oh yes, dear too - TERRIBLE! AWFUL!"'
Ohh no, it makes my skin creep!
No, it was a table.
There is something to be said for silence
Ohh the tag is broken.
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
And where did they get married?
The Alps.
Ohhh I've never been there. 
Yes, it's unholy.
I'll be back.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
Someone died here. It's tapu.
No, no they know another track - to the side of this.
Yes
What for?
The piano.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
You don't want to learn.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it.
You mean in signs?
No, words. You have never heard words?
No, not words.
They are washed.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
I just want to listen.
He chopped it off
She says, throw the piano overboard.
It's quite safe, they are managing...
It's my mother's piano.
A piano?
It must come.
Hello.
She never gives him a turn.
Do I know any gigs?
Play a song then
That's right.
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
Who told ya this guy was in here?
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
Right through there.  But I wouldn't go in there if I were you. 
He'll probably fall down.
Naw, it's okay.
Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'. 
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
What makes you think you can trust him?  He didn't do shit.
You got a bag or somethin?
How 'bout a handkerchief?
Here.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
No.  Never saw him before.  He's a dick, though.
I had some appointments.
How much did ya lose?
All of it.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
You think my play is bad?
I think it's the best...
If that's the way you want it.
That's the way I want it.
Use Salino.  It'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it.
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
He was a con man, wasn't he?
The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way.
Mottola.
They're still looking for him.
Who's got the contract?
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
Good lad.
You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
All he's gotta do is read.
I can talk, can't I?
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
Lonnegan after you, too?
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
You never do, kid.
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
You know anything about him?
Why?
If we ever get to it.
Well we got some workin' money anyway.
Yeh, it was easy.
What do ya mean?
He threatened to kill me.
Did he say he wouldn't?
He'll show.
I thought I'd lost him.
It was too noisy.
You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
Yeh.
You wanta wait for your share?
Naw, I'd just blow it.
That's why he won't know it.
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
See ya and raise three.
See and raise five.
Five and call.
Pass.
Raise 500.
What are the odds on Syphon?
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
You doin' anything tonight?
Yeh, sleepin'.
No.  What's wrong with the front?
He'd like to kill me.
Yeh, this time anyway.
No.  They're just the only ones we know of.
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
Well we can't talk in here.  They're having the place painted.
How ya doin', Jimmy.
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
Three grand on the black, Jimmy.
What do you mean?
Then why the rat?
660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
If I'm not there by quarter of, I'm not coming.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
I am after this race.
Give 'em a little time.
You're a lucky man, all right.
Why don't ya then.
I'm in.
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
If your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more.
No.
I don't know, figure something out.
Don't think I know him.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
We missed him.
I don't know.  He took it hard.
All right, get outa here.  You're outta work.
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
He'll never do it.
Come on, gimme a break.
Sorry.  Don't know a thing.
Yes.  He admitted it.
Is that what it means?
Of course.
Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
Oh.  I'll do my own typing!
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
I can't find him.  I've tried everything.  I thought you might know.
He's just around the corner.
Why did that man want to kill him?
Said he stole his invention.
Do you suppose.....  ?
Nothing.
You better take a drink.
Another young man.
Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 
Don't cry.
What are you talking about?
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
Oh, here she is.
Nothing.
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
Then what are you hiding?
I'll do nothing of the sort.
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
Now do you believe me!
And I'll give then proof!
He's waiting for you.
Did he tell you where he was going?
What do you mean?
Hello, there!
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
tried him once -
Why don't you try him again?
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
I've got to see you alone!
Yes.
There. 
Why... in the heart.
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
Which way did she fall?
She... she fell over backwards.
I bought it in a pawn shop.
Don't lie to me.
That's the truth.
Forgive me.  How are you?
You see how much we have to say.
This is my wedding.
If you think it'll be all right.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
It's a promise?
He's all right.
You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
He's a brave man.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Better get home before it is.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
I'm very interested in that body.
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
Was there much blood?
Gilbert!
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
know.  But I saw him -
We were looking for this bird.
What's he want of you?
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
Nothing.
Ask him.  I don't know.
I'm asking you.
Keep on asking.
So you say -  Go on, Bob.
No.
Who's is it?
I'll have to try to remember.
Nothing yet to cinch it.
He's holding out on you.
Let's go and see.  Taxi!
I think we're on the right track.
Who're you calling?
Nunheim!
This is enough for me.
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
I'll take care of him.
No.
--was Wynant's.
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
Seen any signs of it, Bill?
Oh, then you did hear from him?
Well, what?
He telephoned me today.
About three.
Did you go?
Yes.  But he didn't show up.
Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.
Let him have his say out.
Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
I guess all the suspects are here.
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
All right.  All right.
I couldn't go near that woman.
I said all right!
Just what I said I'd do.
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
Chris -- Chris -- !
So I see.
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
You're going to return every cent of it!
I can't! I haven't got it!
What did you do with the rest?
I never had it.
Good.
That's all right.
So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
That's just why I'm going.
Never mind.
What'll I do if something comes up?
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
No.
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?
Hello, Mimi.
Yes...
They'll want more than your word for that.
All right, then -- I'll tell them who did do it!
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
Oh, did he?  What did he say?
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
I didn't knock Julia off.
All right - you didn't.
This is your party.
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
Hello, baby.
I had him out this morning.
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
If you like 'em like that.
You got types?
How many drinks have you had?
Six Martinis.
That last Martini.
Santa Claus.
We need ice.
What are you drinking?
Rye.
What are you going to do with it?
Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
Yes.
No.
No thanks.
They were kidding you.
I'd like to see you work.
Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
That's great.  I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
Someone get a doctor.
There's one coming.
I'll get some towels. 
Yeah.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
No.  It's a Christmas present.
You did.
Who's that?
Macaulay.
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Yes.
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
Your guess is as good as mine.
Oh take it!  Please take it!
Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present.
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
All right, hard guy.  Get up and bleed on the rugs.
What's the matter with you?
But Wynant --- ?
I don't believe he did it.
Why don't you?
Come on, Watson, we're going places.
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
What are you going to do?
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
You bet I wouldn't.
You dog!
Goodbye, darling.
Sure I will.
He was down in the shop.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
Wynant's body?
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
Sure.
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
No.  Nobody but you.
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
Got a nice evening dress?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Got a nice evening dress?
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations. 
Who do you think did it?
Mimi!
Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner..... 
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
I wish you'd tell me.
I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
I don't know.
Why are you saying it?
It's the only way it makes sense.
I hope you're well.
How did you get in here?
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
Yes.  Nick!
Yes.
I know I left them there.
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
Maybe she has.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
I just wanted to tell you...
I'm fired.
You did.
Baghdad.
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
Turn the car around.
It's a fortune box.
There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.
Better grab up some sand to take home to your family.
No, please, not again.
We're going to keep driving.
Wha...
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
For climbing.
Break it out.
Yeah.
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
Let me see the map.
Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.
Move!
I heard!
What about it?
Maybe we should split it up now.
You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
You don't know he isn't.
He's an enemy soldier.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
It's a combat action.
No.
Get out of my way.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
Suppose I don't go for that?
I have to answer him.
So you can give us away?
If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
Knock it off!
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
No you're not.
There might be something in there.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
There might be.
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
But we all got to be in for this.  We all go, or we do nothing.
We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
Roger that.
You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
Oh, that's fun.
You know, you sound just like a boy who's never--
Wh-what do you think--
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
We can see them, they can see us.  We run, they chase.
It's the only way.  We drive!
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
Let's go.
Millionaires, man.
We leave it.
I got that...sir.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all.  Just a sip.
Mine.
Mine.  Land mine!
I heard it click.
Just be cool.
It's a mine, isn't it?
Just relax.
Why you got to move away to talk!?
Epps...
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
It's the treasure, that's what it is.
Shut up and listen!
It's a fire fight.
What are they doing here?
Something like that.
Stay low.
Where the hell is it!?
Just stay down.
They're going to kill us!
They can't shoot us in here.
So where do we start?
What does it look like I'm doing?
Is it dead?
Yeah, Bwana, you got it.
Not when you're up here with the gold, I guess not.
How!?
We'll find our way!  We'll...
We can't just leave him.
Wes is dead!
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
They'll search the pack.
And you; you've got it all together.
Is it all right if I stand up?
Yeah.
I don't want to die.
Makes two of us.
Damn.
It's got to be going better than this..
Okay.  Then we go this way.
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
Well, we should identify ourselves.
Yeah, I guess we should.
And then what?
And then shoot them.
I don't have a weapon.
Shi'ites, I think.
Is that good, or bad?
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
Why haven't they killed us!?
I don't know!
With what?  Against how many?
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
Me?  I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.
We go this way.
The...the gold...
You shouldn't think about things like that.  It'll just make you crazy.
Yeah.
What?
Thought you were going to buy a car.
He'll slow down.
He's going to slow down.
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
Just...want to be ready when we do.
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
The photos.
Oh yeah.  Accidently.
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
I thought it would be good to know.
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
Now you need me.
Yeah, you're funny.
Naw, nothing.
You will.  You'll get it.
What?
Like I said; so?
What!?
You ever think about dying?
You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
It's a container.  Break the seal.
Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
Oh, no.
Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
How the hell should I know how much?
You know what I'm doing with my half?
Oh, God!
You see that?  Right by us.  They went right by.  You had them Epps; you called it.
We got to get out of here.
Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
You have to go with us.  You can't walk back...
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
I know you're a pussy.  I know that.
We have to do something.
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
We make it, or we go back empty handed.
Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
Lines up with the map and the photos.
Yeah, we're down.
What do you see?
All last night he could have been--
I think he wants something to drink.
I'm not wasting my water on him.
Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
You actually got around to killing someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're only half a bitch.
Correct.  Origin?
Violation?
triple three, triple three! easy.....
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.
Correct.
What happened?
4732...?
Too low.
No, Tetanty.
You've seen enough.
Now.
A shift change should come through the scheduling office.
Don't go.
Don't be so sure.
That's not food.  Can't be food.
Looks like food.
I'll try.
No....I though  I'm afraid.
I don't know.
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
Don't let them separate us.
AH UGH.
They're watching us now.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
It's wrong; so wrong, what we've done....
No!...No!...
What?
We're leaving.
THX and me.
But you can't.  We must escape.
I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
No, look!  Three degrees from the central azimuth.
You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
What?
What?
Why are you so concerned?
What's going on?
I want you for my roommate.
What?
When?.....How?
Right now.
But you can't...you.
Look!
I was lost.
...and you're not lost now?
No, I...
That way.
Look more closely.
What?
Too late....stay close.
What kind of answer is that?
All the insides are gone!
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
Shut up.
You don't know that!
Where's LUH?
Look more closely.
What do you want?
Save yourself....
I thought of something.....
I can't understand.  The sedatives....
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
They're not here.
Where are they?
And you are...?
Officer Reilly, vice.
We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
No thanks, Bev.
Go ahead.
Aren't you on suspension?
Just do it.
Hang on.
You the Bomb Squad?
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
Anything else I should know?
Don't push it, slick.
Where...?
Drive.
Look, it's a longshot...
`Til we get a better lead.
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
Be right back.
Where you guys at?
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
Would you?
Off the scale.
Right.
Nothing.
Okay, let's go in.
Don't touch that.
Stay to your left.
I don't know.
What... ?
How the hell do you feel yellow?
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
It's from an IRA.
Oh shit...
We work fast enough for you?
Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?
Helluva fuck factor.
Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.
A bowling alley.
Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
We've created a monster.
Reilly! He's loaded!
He's my brother...
I know. I warned them.
Security.
Nothing... just tired.
Stay here.
Alex, please.
What? Nobody, I-
Shut up!  Who is this?
Take him!
A ticking bomb...
Nothing so far.
What about the ballistics report?
Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.
Look, it's important.
What kind of bomb was it?
Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead.
Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
I don't know...
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
Awright! How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking?
Fuck factor ten.
C'mon, it's a quiet night.
You will, one day at a time. I'll be old and grey when it happens...
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
What was it this time?
She wanted to cook me breakfast.
Don't talk.
Ain't that a shit--
It's about this.
What?
Captain assigned me to assist you.
Huh?
You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?
My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
That feeling won't last long.
Goddamit, Reilly--
I thought I told you--
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
I promised her she'd be safe.
It's our only option.
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
Pull back. You're only an observer.
We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
And diamonds in the front.
Yes.
Diamonds all over.
Well, have you found it?
erect in sweater, arms folded.
He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.
<u>Niente!</u>
About tonsils.
<u>Tonsili!</u>
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba. 
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
No.
No.
You've never been in Constantinople?
No!
<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
Umm.
You're looking fine, Major.
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
The type they marry.
Like it?
Smart. London, eh?
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
I thought so.
Just dull.
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
I want to see-- 
Yes, Baron.
And as for you, waiter--
Yes, Baron?
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
Thank you.
Yes, Baron. Thank you. 
I hope so, too.
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
And I have known the Lavals of Marseilles for more than thirty years.
Um-hum!
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
No, not at all!
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
I don't <u>know</u>, M'sieu Giron!
But not now.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
No, to you--M'sieu <u>Monescu</u>.
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
What is it?
You say I am a crook.
I know it!
Monescu.
M'sieu Monescu!
Just call me Gaston.
Thank you, Major. 
Good day, Doctor.
No, Captain, I tell you--
No--no.
I would like to.
No--proud. Very proud!
Thank you.
The pepper, too?
No, thank you.
Gaston Monescu.
Last year? It can't be that long.
Sweetheart, what day is today?
The fourteenth of May.
Two fifty-three, five--
But it's not enough!
They're all right, aren't they?
Yes!  Now don't worry!
Correct. Now the train leaves--
By the way, how is your German?
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Now, Lily--
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
Lily-- 
Lily!
You like that statue?
Not particularly.
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
The pleasure is mine, madame.
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Naturally I did.
Oh!
Too much blue in crimson.
That's what you need!
Peaches and cream.
That's too dark.
Do you realize I have light eyes?
Make it out to cash!
As you like. 
Yes!
Beautiful specimen.
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
Isn't that wonderful!  You see, madame-- 
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
It's disgraceful!
You're hired!
And so will M'sieu Giron.
Um-hum ...
Then lunch in the Bois--
Together.
Then a little nap--
How do you like my dress?
Hair?
Marvelous.
Lipstick?
Correct!  Good night.
Good night. 
Good night.
Goodbye.
Precisely.
No--yours, madame.
Like that?
Like that!
I know all your tricks.
And you're going to fall for them.
So you think you can get me?
Any minute I want!
You're conceited--
But attractive--
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
I'm crazy about you!
I know it.
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
I <u>believe</u> you.
Then why do you want to go?
Because I want to make it tough for you.
But I don't want to be a lady.
No--thirty-five! 
Call the police?
Instantly.
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Mariette!
Yes, Gaston?
Adolph J. Giron.
And you expect me to believe that?
Naturally not. But I expect the police to believe it. 
I don't believe it!
Goodbye.
It could have been marvelous ...
Divine ...
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Goodbye ... 
Yes, Madame Colet?
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Yes--uh--
No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
Yes, madame!
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
Please!  Thank you.
May I?
To me he seems rather nervous.
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
For all the really important things--
How much is your salary?
Ever had a romance with a crook?
I beg your pardon!
But you're the more intelligent one.
That's true.
Then why did you do it?
Because I hate him--because I love you!
Yes, my bag!
Didn't you take it with you?
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
But you saw it here.
Yes, I saw it--but--
Well, where is it?
An hour, two at most.
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
And to you, Mr. Andrews.
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
You are, Lewis.  You rolling?
Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.
Don't drop it Rose.
...Mrs. Calvert?
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.  Come on.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.
An accident?!
Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you --
What do I tell your mother?
Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic.
Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
Good. Settled then.
Can I bum a cigarette?
No caviar for me, thanks.  Never did like it much.
Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...
Well I can.
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
We've struck ice.
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
No.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
Uh, yes. Of course. After you.
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
Jack.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
Is he your boyfriend?
Worse I'm afraid.
So don't marry him.
It is that simple.
Just some sketches.
May I?
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
You wouldn'ta jumped.
You're still my best girl, Cora.
Just move with me. Don't think.
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
You're right. Only you can do that.
Sssshh. Come here.
Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.
To the stars.
It's okay. I'm alright.
Could it have damaged the ship?
Now it's worse.
He couldn't have.
I know, I know.
I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
I'll be right back.
I'll wait here.
We'll find out.
Get in the boat, Rose.
Right.
Never let go.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
You think she was really there?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.
I should like to see my drawing.
Just tell us what you can --
You had it the entire time?!
Excuse me.
Charmed, I'm sure.
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
Goodbye, mother.
Do you want the truth, Anya?
It would be a nice change from you.
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
This is Miss Marsh.
I'll join you later.
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
Glad to see you again.
That's a date. 
We'll save you a place at our table.
Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
<U>Gladly</U>.
No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
Where's Lother?
What did you want a gun for?
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Guess again, copper.
Get moving--
If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink. 
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
Sure!  Excuse me.
Want to take it back?
Nice lines--
Yes--
You've got lipstick all over you.
I could stand some more--
No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
How about giving me another coat?
Good-by.
There's soft music--
Have we?--Well, I'd just as soon play shuffle-board.
Well--breakfast?  Lunch?
Brett is the name.
Even Cupid's becoming modern, using medicine balls instead of darts.
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
Very--your mother?
Don't be a c-a-t.
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
Well, I can't.
Don't rub it in.
But I'll have cocktails with you.
At seven-thirty?
Sooner it you like.
Okay.
Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
I'll be there--Good-by.
Sorry.
Thanks.
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
Don't let's talk about it.
You said it! How about a little action?
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
Good night, idiot!
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
Lose?--I won a little--
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
Come on--let's take a swim.
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
I'll be waiting on deck.
What's the matter?
I thought you were a smart guy.
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
We coulda got two third-class!
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
I'll give you half of it.  Here's seventy cents. 
Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.
How're the tips?
A dollar forty.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
My change.
Change?
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Are you screwy?
I'll take one. 
Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
Partners, ain't we?
<U>Me</U>!
Sure! McKinney will never suspect you--
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
On the drunk.
Get it!
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
It's a pleasure.
Much better--thank you--
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
Why isn't that a good time to quit?
Think again--
Oh, yes. On the pier.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
I'll go with you--
No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
I'll go with you.
Swell!
How about trying your fine Italian hand?
Coming to the pool for a swim?
Thanks. That makes us square.
Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
What'll I say?
In New York.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Cut it out.
Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
No. <U>Knots</U>!
What?
Knots!
Yes--Me--in person!
So what?
<U>Nuts</U> to you too!
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
Miss Marsh.
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Is this your gun?
Yes!
No--not much--excepting-- 
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
I'll never love anybody else.
I don't get the humor of that remark.
<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
Very serious?
Very--
Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--
You don't shoot squirrels.
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
Well, let's hear the poem--
I'm getting seasick--
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
What's he got that I haven't got?
Well, he has a straw hat--
So what?
Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--
Easy kid--easy....  Come on--I want to talk to you.
Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
About twelve hundred.
I went for four.
Thanks to me.
You leave the kid alone.
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
I'm not so clumsy with fingerprints--
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
Maybe you will after you've thought it over.
I sincerely hope so--
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.
Thank you.
Thirty one's and two ten's?
"Smooth's" the word.
Do you think Lother could have seen it?
Aren't the roses beautiful?
What!--are you crazy?
I'll explain later--
Let me look at it.
Ain't got time.
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Then why did you run away?
Because you ran after me.
500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
Isn't that a daisy?
Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good.
Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
That's not what I meant.
Yes, very.  And very married.
Oh, so that's it...
Not now.  I don't have time.
You will after tonight.  Bet on it.
Well I'm not so go home.
Beauty, ain't he?
I asked where you got him.
Where do you think?  I stole him.
Good.  That's real good.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
We're gonna get along just fine.
Excuse me?
You retired, too?
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
Yeah, you look it.
In pace requiescat.
All right, lunger.  Have at it.
Here it come: one-two-
Say when.
I been having the boy at the Hotel pack us up every night Since your streak started
Better.
Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.
Forgive me if I don't shake hands.
I know him.  That's Creek Johnson.
But who was the Devil?
You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
Ignore her?
I'll remember you said that.
In vino veritas.
Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
What does he want?  He wants revenge.
Revenge?  For what?
That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry.
Never got to wear one of those.
You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin.
Sorry...
Not half as bad as I feel.
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
I don't.
What?  But I saw 'em-
I'm telling you, there isn't a Mark on him.
I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire.
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.
You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
Damn!  All right, wait a minute...
What was that all about?
What?
No.
I made a promise.
All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
I know.  Me neither.
Yeah.  Or undertakers.
How is he?
Never even heard of anything like it.
It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
Easy now... That mare's in season.
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
Where do you get these questions?
Just answer.
How would you know?
Just doesn't, that's all.
Then let's make sure we get our Money's worth
Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.
And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.
I hate Sadie.
Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
I didn't mean it that way.
I forgave you the moment you said it.
You did.  Well... thank you.
Wait!
I think I'll just lie down awhile
They're just lonely is all.  Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
Oh, all right.
No really, I can stay a while.
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
All right, well, good night.
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?
I don't know.  I'm all right.
Really?  You sure?
Sure I'm sure.  What is this?
Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.
I need it.
'Least you admit it.
You wanted to talk?
That what you got me up here for?
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
You're the boss.  One thing, though.
McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither.
I'm not a lawman, I'm just a Private citizen getting' my Property back
Drop his horse.
We'll see about that.
So he can tell the story.
They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.
We'll go around that way, come up on foot.
Well what do you think happens When you die?
I read this book, book on Spiritualism...
Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, I'm serious!
Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
I'll be damned...
Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.
Fine.  Better.
I know, kid.  I know.  Me too.
That didn't sound like thunder.
You're on.
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Well I'm real scared.
Doc's just in no kinda shape.
So to speak.
Kinda, actually, yeah.  I gotta admit.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
You'll never make that stick.
They're carrying guns in town.
Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.
Wyatt...
Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that Other idiot?
Bring up the tracking satellite. And get 007 out of there.
GET BOND OUT OF THERE.
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
And I have the entire British economy to worry about.
You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
Sir Elliot.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
Chernobyl will look like a campfire.
What about the gold?
Him? He, is a she -  at the bar.
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
- We all want what we can't have?
- Four wheel drive?
What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
Is that any way to say hello?
I thought your specialty was good-bye.
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
Do you?
Just hold me.
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
Well... If you insist.
Gone fishing.
Fishing?
Not from forty feet.
Let's take a look at the body.
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Step into my office.
Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
She married a hockey player.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
Can you arrange a meeting?
Hell. The CIA built that club.
He tied one on.
Wait a minute -  I've got it. There! Off the port bow!
That's reassuring.
They point, I shoot.
Depends what number you write.
Three. You? Married?
No.
I didn't think so.
You too.
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
Let's not make it a habit.
Think about mom.
- The family jewels?
- You're not.
No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
Blood or Dutch?
He was my father's best friend!
You are seriously deranged.
No. I'm going with you.
My father left me the business.
What do you mean?
Up.
Don't say it.
Next time, I do the driving.
I didn't say when I want to die -
Now.
Only what I read in the newspapers.
'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.
It seems, 007, we've received a tip
Good luck on your mission, 007.
What do you make of all this?
It doesn't quite add up.
Indeed they are.  Deadly little things.
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
Tsi tien, Professor Wu.
I am. What do you want?
Captain Morton.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
What's wrong?
Seems to be back to normal, sir.
I see you two have met.
- I told you! He was there! -
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
My timing always was lousy.
Approaching the first gate.
Start the grinders.
You have to leave -
You come with me -  You stay here.
Fueled and waiting.
I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!
Yes. Shall we kill them?
It's Bond!
Kill him! Finish it!
You disappoint me, Number Three.
Thank you sir! Thank you!
One to seven: Deal the face cards.
Who is it?
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
What's in the box, General?  What's in the box???
Maybe. Maybe not.
Abort the cruise.
Will the cruise set it off?
Since when?
We got the same thing.
Oh here we go with that.
They're too big.
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
You always got something to say.
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
I told her I would if she would give me time.
My name is Sam. Samuel.
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
It was nip and tuck.
I guess it proves you really care about me. You hung in there.
Babe Brother.
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
Well, you look better than you did yesterday.
I'm going back home with Harry.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
I heard his voice as clear as day. I better get back. Maybe something is wrong.
Not anymore, not in the city.
Now how far would further out be?
I'm not here to argue, sir.
Go back to sleep.
You all act like two roosters.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
You're always taking his side.
Hush.
You're going to find yourself on the floor.
It would be nice.
No, I'm too hot now.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
Just stay in bed and rest.
I will appreciate that.
You must have been really sick.
How is the garden doing?
How is that hen doing? I was meaning to pip her before I fell sick.
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick?
What happened to your hand?
I cut it on an old rusty knife.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
But these are white people, anybody. The punch...
He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
I'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger?
It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
I tell you, I feel like a ghost.
Tolerable well.
I hope that it's nothing serious.
Only if you can spare it.
Good afternoon to you.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
Hattie is a different person now.
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
Emory had made a lot of enemies. He had a big mouth.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
That is a boy from home, Lulla's brother.
Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say?
I already have, my dear.
You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out.
Don't shout!
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
Where is Skip?
I'm sorry he got those birds.
You know the man next door is near death.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
Whadda ya think?
Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
You can bring ONE toy...
Just one?
No, I haven't seen him.
But Mom, I can't find him!
Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
Sure!  I'll even let you drive.
Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.
Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
Where was the last place you left him?
Right here in the van.
Bye, house.
What?  What is it?
Woody!  Buzz!
Here!  In the car!
Let's let Molly open one.
Rocky!  The ramp!
Mm-hmmmmm.
HO-YAAAHH!!!
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
T-O-Y.  Toy.
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
Yes, I can.
Can!
Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
All right, then, I will.  Stand back everyone!
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
I'd better take a look anyway.
Sure is a hairy fellah.
No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!
You mean that happy child?
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
Go away.
Sorry.
Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
We've got to get out of here...NOW.
What?!
It's ok.  Everything's under control.
NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!!
Look out!!
Woody!  The rocket!
The match!
Hold still, Buzz!
You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
We're not aiming for the truck!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
Everyone, it's Woody!
Sorry there, old Spudhead.
I got dibs on his hat!
Heh-heh.
Are you peeking?
Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
How 'bout three out of five?
He's in the psycho's bedroom!
Murderer!
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
I don't know!
Oh no, Hannah!
What?
Look!  Janie!
She's sick!
No she's NOT --
NO-O-O... Don't touch her!  NO!
Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
Will you quit moving around?!
How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
A lunchbox...?!
Alright!  That's it!
I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
Now, it was an accident!  Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
You murdering dog!
No, no, no, wait!
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
Okay, save your batteries!
Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
Oh, I don't like confrontations.
There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
He got it, Woody!
Sir!  No Sir!
Okay, thank you.  At ease.
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Come in, Mother Bird. Alright...Andy's opening the first present now.
So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.
Andy's coming, everybody!  Back to your places.  Hurry!
I can't quite make out -- 

Sid!!!
Huh?
It's busted.
That's right.  Your toys.
Right here, Woody!
Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
Sh-h-h-h-h!!
I knew you'd come back, Woody!
See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
Slink!  Hang on!
There's no mirror.
You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.
I did like the music.
I carried you up to your bed.
Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.
Didn't you know he made things?
She'll have to learn.
What about school?
Get away from me...
What did I do wrong?
You're only a young thing.
You're not so old yourself!
Living with him put years on me.
Let me in.
Ah, come on now!
I'm cold.
I finished it off.
You did what?
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
Can you move over a wee bit?
Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
I've got a present for you...
In my pocket.
It was only a mouthful!
Surely she is older?
All the time.
So did I.
Everything is gone, now.
Storms?
Victoria -
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
I can't find Manolo.
He's not here.
Nine thousand dollars.
Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.
You will believe me, because it's true.
Arnie, thank God.
That's a very apt analogy, Helena. Now, go home and be with your children.
I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say.
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
I can't do that.
It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --
What?
So my wife is lying?
Goodbye Arnie.
Me, too.
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
Why?
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
Me, too.
So's the video camera.
At least she's alive.
Honey, your father knows the President.
That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
Not yet.
Are you going to?
I don't know.
Is this bad for him?
What do you think?
Hi.
What's up?
I got that.  How was your day?
I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
Somehow, I don't see that happening.
How long's the job?
Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
Like I give a fuck.
Oh, yes I can.
Sixteen
Live with your parents?
Yes.
Parents still together?
Do you work?
Cincinnati Country Day.
Yeah.
How are your grades?
I'm third in my class.
What's that mean?
I get A's.  All A's.
You do?  What else you do?
Just watch.
What is this, like freebase?
Not like.  It is.
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
Yes, mom --
Then here's a little bump.
Who do you work for?
She knows Arnie Metzger.
So does half of San Diego.
You want to make a wager on this?
Winners don't do coke.  Or haven't you been reading the bumper stickers?
I don't know.
She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
Depends who it's from.
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
Arizona.
We're playing!
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
We aren't barbarians.
Yes, sir!
You will dine with me from now on.
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
Yeah.
What's he doing up here?
They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.
Your new friends.
What?
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
I feel like a traitor.
Javier Rodriguez.
It was an anonymous tip.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
What is it you want me to do?
A small thing.  Nothing really.
Only if he can be trusted.
He'll do what I say.
So what's it doing in Tijuana?
I need to find my daughter.  I'll pay you.
I got money.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
Just tell me where she is.
She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home.
She hasn't called you?
I don't know what to say.
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
We sometimes went downtown to score.
You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
Agents who died in the field.
What do you mean?
It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --
No. On you go.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
Bit fucking late, like.
Well, why didn't you bring them?
You've stabbed me, man.
You were in my way.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
Sorry's no going to dry me off, you cunt.
I've no fucking cigarettes.
Can you not go yourself.
Let's face it, it could have been wonderful.
I guess you would, Franco.
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
What's your name?
Diane.
I'm going home.
Where's that?
It's where I live.
What?
think I left something back at the -
Ssshh!
Sorry.
Shut up.
Come on.
And don't make any noise.
Because it's illegal.
Holding hands?
No, not holding hands.
Easy for you to say.
Can I see you again?
Certainly not.
Are you clean?
Yes.
Is that a promise, then?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
Smells like it.
You're too young.
Too young for what?
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
What? Steady like?
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
Sixteen next month.
Happy birthday.
Well, he's young and he's healthy.
It's an interesting theory.
He forgot. Useless motherfucker.
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
Eh? How's that?
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
Do you recall the school motto?
Of course, the motto, the motto --
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks.
Sorry about last night -
No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.
It's no problem.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
Spud, they're my sheets.
No.
Following the game at all?
No.
No. Me Neither.
Aye.
Clear?
Aye.
That's nice.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
Have you got any gear on you?
No, I'm clean.
Cheers.
Now remember --
Yeah.
But try too hard --
And you might get the fucking job.
Nightmare.
Running time?
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
Director?
Lewis Gilbert.
Screenwriter?
OK, so who was it, then?
You can look it up.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
Who wrote it?
Roald Dahl.
Roald Dahl. Fuck me.
OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
I don't rate that at all.
Despite the Academy award?
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
That's your theory?
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Give me the gun.
Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.
I'm cooking' up. There is a silence.
It wasn't that bad.
Did he -- you know?
What?
You know.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
He made me lick it.
God, you're sick.
When are you going to visit him?
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
Four Grand.
But you don't have the money?
We're two thousand short.
That's tough.
Well, it's up to you.
The Sick Boy method.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
That's hardly a substitute.
you'll need one more hit.
No, I don't think so.
Your favourite dish.
Excellent.
Why, thank you.
Yeah.
Sure will, pal, sure will.
Are you serious?
No joy yet.
How long is it?
Six weeks!
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.
Well, I've paid for the ticket.
What?
A walk.
But where?
I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal.
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
And how did you breach the Barrier?
With a starship!
It will be your chariot!
You doubt me?
Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
Return to prearranged coordinates for pickup.
Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
Plotting our new course.
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position.
Position, Bird of Prey?
Closing.
But the shuttle-
DO it. Go to Red Alert.
I don't have a clue.
A Federation starship.
Do you realize what you've done? It wasn't bloodshed I wanted.
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
No, but you can bet they will.
Understood. Kirk out.
What do you know of my pain?
The power was within you.
What is it you seek?
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
If we could send a distress signal...
ER... You forgot to take it with you.
Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
Put it on the screen.
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
Because it's there.
Ah, Captain?
I've always known... I'll die alone.
I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
Yes, Spock?
Go to sleep, Spock.
Goodnight, Bones.
Goodnight, Doctor.
Yes.
Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
But he does seem familiar?
Who is it he reminds you of?
Mr. Sulu. Execute.
Yes, Captain?
Be one with the horse.
Yes, Captain.
Let me do something.
Captain, what have I done -
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
You ordered me to kill my brother.
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek.
I have a half brother.
I gotta sit down.
He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
Is what possible?
That's a little vague, Spock -
"c."... "k."
The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
Uh-uh.
It must be all those marsh melons.
The emergency channel, open.
Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
It's all right, Captain.  Proceed.
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Not possible. You were never alone.
Yes. I lost a brother once. I was lucky. I got him back.
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
I'll take you to the bridge.
I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?
No. I refuse.
Am I? We'll see.
The ship needs its Captain.
No conditions.
Because you, too, must know.
Spock...






  




I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
I had a feeling you would say something like that. So I brought us dinner.
He's not?
No. You must kill me.
You know I'm right.
I hide no pain.
I know you better than that.
Do you?
I cannot go with you.
Why not?
I belong here.
Sybok, we must find a way...
No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
You haven't told him?
Hi, Flynn.
Uh... got any cinnamon?
You call that getting over it?
I mean I want both of us to go.
To warn him.
Of what?
For being on to Dillinger.
What -- ?
Hello, Alan.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
only yes and no...  You're a bit.
Right on the money!
Yes, okay, exactement!
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
Not a chance.
Let's get outta here.
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
End of line.
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
What do you want with the Pentagon?
Thank you, no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on.
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
Well, isn't it -- ?
I, uh... I'm a program from a User that... knows Alan...?
Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
No good...they might block off the old chip.  This way.
Greetings, program...
You're alive!
Yeah, I... oops!
Yes.
How about you?
Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
It's too far!
Why? What are you going to do?
Shhhhh.
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play video games better than anybody.
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
Tron...?
Recognizers!
Alan-One...
Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -
Good luck. You can't even think in here.
Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
As long as we stay off the top floor, Dillinger'll never know we've been in here...
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
Are you kidding? You guys'll he running this joint by then...
End of line.
I don't have time, Sark. And neither do you. End of line.
The Users...you really think they're still there?
Do it!
We have to.
I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
Why is everything...like this?
It's a flat. But wait a micro...
I had to...in the games...
Then I owe you some thanks...
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
We have to get off this beam!
I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
It's something Users do.
Where's Flynn?
Yeah.  You know Harry.
Simon?  Ohmygod.
Will you shutup.  I should never have told you about him.
I have a book report.
Yeah, Dad.
Fine.
Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
Unbelievable!  Trent told me he wrote it.  He's history.
Dad.  You just think you know everything, don't you?
Probably because it sounds scary.				*
In the helicopter.
What?
Yep.  Sleep fast.
Here, check these out.
What?
Right.  She's only fourteen.
Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
Just hang a minute.
I'll just hang then, shall I?
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
Put a tap on her phone.
What're you talking about?  We have that.
Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house.
Yeah, but for who?							*
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PAGE!!
The purse is still at the house.
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
Sorry.
But you didn't.  Why not?
So, it was your first time.
I wasn't cheating!
I agree.
Yes what?
Uh, yes, it is important.
Not exactly.
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Sure.  Say that now.
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
Okay.
Me too.
Yeah, it was wild.
What did you tell him?
Yeah.  It was great.
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
My husband the hero.
They said you had to run out.
He needed my help.
Not because you were attracted to him?
Well, maybe a little.
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
Why?
What did you need?
Answer the question--
Louder please.
Yes or no.
You will be contacted with the assignment.
My husband can't know about this.
No.  Doris.
I'm not wearing any.
Harry, be quiet.  Let me handle this.
You wouldn't believe me.
It makes you tell the truth?
Is it working yet?
Are we going to die?
Yup.										*
What about Juno?
She's really a fox, isn't she?
Did you pork her Harry?
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
God, you have great legs.
Harry... snap out of it!
Do you still love me?
Yes.
No.  Much more.
Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.
Sorry.  Trade secret.
Go ahead.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Fuck you.
I'm sorry, I can't.
You can trust me completely.
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
Yes.  Now go.
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable.
Relax.  There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role.
Find out who this Renquist it.
His wife.
His wife?  Good.  Bring them.
What letter?
What letter?
Nope.
He wants to speak with you.
You can't have just one.
This is great, we got cable.
Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.
How come?
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
Oh, hush up.
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
The letter he sent.
Ya looked through it?
Get it.
Now hang up.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
Thanks a lot.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Is that your real name? Really?
That's my real name, really. I got proof. See.
I took a cab.
'Bout twelve.
No. Not particularly.  How come?
Would you like to get some pie?
How 'bout me what?
Tell me about yourself.
There's nothing to tell.
What do you want to know?
What do you do?
Where are you from.
Burt Reynolds.
Very much. Now, where were we?
What kinda music do you like?
Almost four years.
That's a long time.
I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
At the movies?
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
You're not stupid. Just wrong.
Uh-huh.
My pimp.
You have a pimp?
Uh-huh.
A real live pimp?
Uh-huh.
Is he black?
Will you be my wife?
You will?
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
I don't believe so.
Thank you.
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...
I just gotta get somethin'.
Write down Drexl's address.
Why?
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
I think what you did...
What?
... was so romantic.
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
How come?
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
Naw naw!
Take that shit somewhere else.
Can you live with it?
You wanna get unhaunted?
Yeah.
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
He don't got no right to live.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.
She's with me.
Who the fuck are you?
I'm her husband.
You got it.
It's great to hear from you.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
You comin' to L.A.? When?
What's up? Why're leavin' Detroit?
I'm a married man.
Get the fuck outta here!
Ask him if he got the letter.
Now tell him goodbye.
You goin' out?
It'll get ya high.
I certainly hope so.
I don't know! A fuckin' lot!
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
Elliot what?
Elliot Blitzer.
The zoo.
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
Let me handle this.
No shit? Dick, that's great!
Yeah?
Um, nothing, let's go?
In case of what?
Really?
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
Yeah, OK.
Unloading? That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime.
What do you think, eightball?
The police department?
They'll be along.
Yeah?
Get on your knees.
No.
You are the dumbest person in the world.
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
No. Not yet.
Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.
We grew up together.
Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
That's about all I ever eat.
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
What makes you think I would do that?
I got some money I can give you -
I give up. Who are you?
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Step inside.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Thank you.
Could we try it now?
Absolutely.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Uh-huh.
That was a good fuckin' movie.
Sure was.
Do you believe him?
I believe he believes him.
We talked him into it.
But a fuckin' baggie.
Or a bit player -
Or a supporting actor -
That is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions.
You do.
Hope you're a good actor, Elliot.
How the fuck could he know?
How's he supposed to see the wire?
He knows something's up.
Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.
Rock whores.
Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
Just put it in your purse.
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
Put it in your pants.
No.
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Do you live here?
Yeah, I live here.
Sorta room-mates?
Exactly room-mates.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
No.
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Where's that?
Well, you go down Beechwood...
I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.
Uh, I didn't hear the...
Uh, what?
Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
You're still a little... disoriented.
This is it, James...what you've been working for.
Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
I need to go.
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
You don't have a driver's license, James?  Or a Social Security card?
You wouldn't understand.
A jail?  Prison?
Underground.
Hiding?
What's wonderful about the air, James?
It's so clean.  No germs.
You're afraid of germs?
I have to go.
July.
July?!
What year is it?
What year do you think it is?
1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989.
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
No.  That's the reason they chose me -- I remember things.
No more drugs.  Please...
1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
What?
Clues?  What kind of clues?
Who's keeping an eye on you?
I did him a favor.  Now come on.
Lock it now!
Jeffrey Mason?
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
You have to give yourself up, you know.
The gun! ... I lost it
You're sure?
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
Just like that?  You were in prison?
No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
...I had a dream about...something like that.
I...I...We need cash, James.
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop.
It's private.
Not, "what", babe!  When!
Monkeys.  Twelve of them.
Plan?  What are you talking about?
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered.
Yes, sir.
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
You see what I mean?  You're being defensive.  Isn't she being defensive, Bob?
You're insane, Jeffrey.
Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist?  And now she's spray- painting our building?
You want to go in?  Examine him?
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
I'll be right here...just in case.
Might be tight.
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
You want something, old man?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
What do you want for free?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
I won't hold my breath.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
I'll bet my watch against your pay.
I'm a rich man off of thirty bucks?
You got two years on me.  What's that make me?
It is not.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
I need a ticket.
Out of here.
But, in particular?
I don't care, just get me there.
One way.
Thirty even.
The ticket is thirty dollars.
You Harlin?
Nope.  Darrell.
Harlin around?
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Yep.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
But he's dead.
So?
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Time.
What time is it now?
Twenty-after-ten.
Ninety-two.  Only gonna get hotter. I remember one time . . .
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
Don't look like nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
Hundred-fifty.
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
What?
Yeah, but it was shot.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Yeah, you better remember that.
There you go, sweet talking me again.
Open up!
Come back when the sun comes up.
You got the money?
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
We ain't got no Beck's.
Kirin?
Taking a little trip?
Who the hell is this!?
Wrong number.
They look nice.
You haven't even looked at them once.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
You didn't hear something?
How could I?  I was sleeping.
There's someone in the house.
What does it look like?
When did you buy a gun?
I'm just going to my car.
That's right on my way.
I don't know your real name.
Maybe I don't want you to.
My cup runneth over, beauti--
It's Grace.
May I carry your package, Grace?
You sure you can manage?
I got it.
What happened to your hand?
You should be more careful.
You're welcome, Grace.
You're not from around here, are you?
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Thank you.
What do you do anyway?
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
Those are white words, not ours.
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
Beautiful?
Like they're made of polyester.
Such as?
Still playing?
You know what I want.
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
No.
Did you ever?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I don't know how.
You just walk away.
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
I can't.
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
Kill someone.  I can't do it.
Jesus Christ!  Listen to yourself! I can't do it, Grace.  I can't do it.
There is no us, remember?
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
What was I supposed to do?
I don't know.
There has to be!
I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
We're going all the way.  Together.
No.
What about him?
Wait.  What about . . . him?
You liar!  You wanted him dead.  You seduced me into killing him!
What?
He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.
He was going to take the money.
He was going to--
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
You killed a man for no reason!
Now what?
Grace!
Can you climb back up.
I'm here.
Where the hell am I going to go?
John, you have to throw the keys up to me.
What for?
The trunk.  It's locked.
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.
And you're not one to lie, are you?
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
You idiot!  You'll kill us both!
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
Fuck you!  Do you hear me, John!? Fuck you!  John . . . John!?
Husband . . .?
Grace, tell him.
Accident.
You've got to be--
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
John Stewart.
What brings you to Sierra?
Ah, I can smell it on you.
Would I what?
Would you kill her?
How do you know if you've never tried?
This is a joke, right?  You just want to rattle me.  Right?
Just ran into a little trouble.
Hungry?
No.
You just seem to attract trouble, don't you?
I was hoping we could talk.
Talk?  About what?
About things.  About your wife.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
About what you said this morning.
You're talking like a mad man.
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
What makes you say that?
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you.
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
I need thirteen.
That's a bit much.
Be quiet, boy.  I'm thinking.  It can't be done at the house.  It should be . . .
No.
You didn't kill her?
The time wasn't right.
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
All I have in the world.
Trouble with the car again?
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
I came for Grace.
You came to take my wife from me?
I came to kill her.
Liar.
It's the truth, Jake.
That's a thick change of heart.
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of.
I said come on!
What?
Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
How about I pick one out for you?
I've had time to get over it.
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
But you was going to fight for me.
What's your name anyway?
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
Christ, I don't believe this.
Stand up.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Oh, shit!
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Not as bad as it looks.
Nope.  No problems up the road.
I don't understand what the--
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
Soda.  You got any soda?
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
But, Senor--
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
Senor, you need a doctor.
No police!
You want something, old man?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
What do you want for free?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.
You know I won't be seeing you.
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
Christ, I don't believe this!
Stand up.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Oh, shit!
Give it to me!
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
Who the hell are you?
I'm her husband.
Grace, tell him.
It ain't broke.
You've got to be--
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
I'm a solid man.
Bobby Cooper.
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
Darrell's a moron.
Live there?
Ah, I can smell it on you.
Would you kill her?
How do you know if you've never tried?
This is a joke, right?  You just want to rattle me.  Right?
I was hoping we could talk.
Talk?  About what?
About things.  About your wife.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
About what you said this morning.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
What makes you say that?
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
I need thirteen.
That's a bit much.
It's not what you think, Jake.
You came to take my wife from me?
It's the truth, Jake.
How about I pick one out for you?
I've had time to get over it.
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
You're too quick for me.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
But you was going to fight for me.
What's your name anyway?
Nope.  Darrell.
He's up at the Look Out.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Yep.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
But he's dead.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Great!
Time.
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be careful with her, will you?
Don't look like nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
Hundred-fifty.
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
What?
Yeah, but it was shot.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Darrell.
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
Open up!
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
Eh?
Soda.  You got any soda?
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
No! No police.
I'm just going to my car?
That's right on my way.
I don't know your real name.
Maybe I don't want you to.
I like that about me, beautiful.
It's Grace.
May I carry your package, Grace?
I got it.
What happened to your hand?
Accident.
You should be more careful.
You're welcome, Grace.
You're not from around here, are you?
Drove into Superior?  What for?
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
I didn't say it bothered me.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Thank you.
What do you do anyway?
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.
Lift me down.
Beautiful?
And what would that be?
Still playing?
You know what I want.
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.
No.
Did you ever?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I don't know how.
Walk away.
Nothing.
Don't feel like nothing.
Try me.
Nothing I understand better than a mess.
Is it pretty?
There is no us, remember?
I could if I had Jake's money.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
No! You get it!
I'm not coming back.
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
But I thought --
What are you talking about?
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
<u>I don't know why</u>!
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
My mother died in this canyon.
I busted my leg!
Can you make it back up?
'Cause I love you.
Harlin's.
Get in.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
Out of here.
But, in particular?
I don't care, just get me there.
One way, or round trip?
One way.
The ticket is 30.55.
What kind?
Beck's.
No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
I think I burned my gun hand!
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
Wrong number.
They look nice.
You didn't hear something?
There's someone in the house.
Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...
Like you helped her, Jake?
I said come on!
Is Noel in?
Yes.
You've made a considerably wise decision.
How old is Jeb?
Four.
No.
What about Jeb?
I have a lock on the door.
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
He's asleep.
Oh.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Not a specific day. What's this about?
Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
Oh.
Yes. Is this David?
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
He's dealing with a lot of things.  I think he needs to find answers himself.
out again?
Rust?
My turn. What's your favorite song?
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
We're supposed to be honest.
What about the game?
It's finished. I won.
I don't know Megan.
In college. A car accident.
Was it serious?
You assumed wrong.
We've already begun.
Is there a problem?
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
But not a knife?
I don't know what you're asking?
One last question.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
Yes he is.
Consider him packed. I didn't like his attitude... Struttin around with a cane and shit.
I want to sleep here tonight.
I won't make any noise.
Just one--
I'm going to work out.
I'll help you.
There's nothing to do.
No Jeremy.
I lied.
Two hundred and seventy.
There's no more left?
I'm not scared.
That's great.
Do you know why?
Know what?
Elijah was wrong.
Jeremy listen to what--
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
Is David Dunne there?
Against a window.
In the passenger car?
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
Was your family traveling with you?
How did you get together?
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
Where is it?
On a bench, across the street.
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
But what they done, they...
I fined 'em instead.
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
We was... lyin'.
Thank God.
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
'Course he's coming.
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
He give 'em names?
You ain't dead.
Oh. How long I been here?
Three days. Are you hungry?
Three days? I must be.
That big guy lookin' for me?
Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
You want... a free one.
Me? No. No, I guess not.
She back in Kansas?
Shit and fried eggs.
Well, I was always tasting the soup two hours after I et it.
Oh.
Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day?
Uh... a little, maybe.
Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it.
All week?
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
They really got all that money, them whores?
You could run off them two cowboys.
I could run off them whores.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
Like I said, I...
What's your name?
Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
I'll see you... in hell, you three fingered asshole.
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
N-no, sir?
Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.
Yeah, I guess so.
Well, how about it?
About what?
Huh?
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
He got the boy's horse.
You missed him? You didn't...?
I got him.
Yeah.
After a ways.
You still think he's in there?
Yeah, he's in there.
You can shoot him.
Yup.
Yeah.
I can't see 'em.
Just SHOOT!
First one I ever killed.
Yeah?
We all got it comin', Kid.
Lemmee see it.
Sure. Sure, Bill.
You better get on back, Miss.
I'd rather be blind and ragged than dead, I guess.
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
You ain't shot.
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
I could tell you who was last, mister.
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
Two weeks, I guess.
This Kid, what's he like?
We'll come across him tomorra, I guess.
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
No. I mean...  ...an' get yourself a woman? You know?
Sometimes... yeah.  I don't miss it all that much.
Yeah.
He hit you?
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
I didn't see nothin' planted.
You're marking us, Bill.
HEY, KID.
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
IS THAT YOU, KID?
HEY KID, IT'S ME, BILL MUNNY.
How far kin you see?
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
Huh? Uh... yeah.
I seen him.
He's dead, Bill.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
She was all covered with worms. Oh, Ned, I'm scared of dyin'...
Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
Two more hogs got the fever.
Best we move that pig.
Three? That ain't bad considerin'.
Tom?
All that money... I mean... did you...?
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
No... I meant...
What?
K-k-kill somebody?
Who said that?
Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
Thought you was followin' me.
You gonna share your half with him?
See that scrub oak yonder?
Fuck you.
He's blind, for Chri...
I ain't blind, you asshole.
Yeah.
I don't like the question.
Plenty of times.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
I don't kill nobody without him. 
Well, suppose he does?
We'll bury him.
That ain't what I mean.
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
Hell, yeah.
Bear with me here...
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
He says the hair is longer and lighter.
They'll never stop.
I love you.
They ruined me tonight.
Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?
Alright.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
Then who goes?
We all go. How about it, Keaton?
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
They fucking know everything.
The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys knew him.
What do you care what he says?
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
I can run. I got no problem with that.
If I'm going in, I want a stake.
County. I was in for fraud.
I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
If you'll just let me -
Never heard of him.
You okay?
I'11 be alright.
Well, I'm sorry.
Forget it.  I'11 probably shit blood tonight.
Maybe more.
Who's Keyser Soze?
Russian, I think. I don't know.
Just do what I tell you.
This I had to see myself.
You know damn well, dead-man.
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
You're lying.
Am I? 92 92    INT. HALLWAY - FIFTIETH FLOOR
Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
You didn't know.
What'the fuck is that?
Two hours, tops.
I want to see him.
Someplace else, then.
Where?
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
Waste of time.
Nothing. Something I - forget it.
He was a corrupt cop, Verbal.
I just want to hear your story.
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .
You know Ruby is in Attica?
He didn't have my lawyer.
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
Is he the one that killed Keaton?
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
Kobayashi.
Came from Redfoot.
Right.
If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
Give a guy a break, huh?
What happened?
Why didn't you say anything?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Keaton was Keyser Soze
NO.
You think he's..?
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
Abrams...
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Nothing.
How good's your intelligence?
Very good.
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
... tell me about this case.
We thought it was just.
You thought it was just.
Yes.
Yes.  It would be.
And no one will know the truth.
What is the truth?
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
It looks that way.
Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ...
What does it mean?
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth.
Say it.
I was her doctor.
...I was one of a group of...
When she...
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr.Marx, of course...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
We went to Code Blue...
`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Well, many reasons, actually...
Tell me one?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
And what did your team do...
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
Frank Galvin.  We've met before.
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
Your Honor...!  Your Honor...
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
Neurology?
No.
Orthopedics?
I'm just an M.D.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I know of him.
How is that?
What book is that?
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
...of Anesthesiology?
`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
How old are you?
I am seventy-four years old.
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
I'm on the staff of...
Objection.
Nothing further, your Honor.
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
I wouldn't do it.
You would not...?
No.
Just now...
Yes.
You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
We just ...
I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
Why is that?
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
I am on the staff of...
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
It's a common medical term.
The Doctors were not negligent.
I...um...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
No, you did fine.
No.  No.  Thank you. You go home.
And you wrote that...
Yes.
Yes?  Galvin, right?
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
... and you're going to do that?
Why?
) I'm sorry ...?
Okay.  I'll meet you here.  Tuesday night ... I gotta go.  You going my way?
... that's perfectly all right.
To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it?
You know what happened.
Nothing happened.
I didn't do it, Mister.
Who are you protecting, then?
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
Then why don't you testify?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
Why is that?
Thank you for seeing me.
That's perfectly all right.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
I had a witness disappear on me.
Ready, your Honor.
Defense...?
Mr. Concannon...?
Overruled...
Exception!
Mr. Alito, please.
Let me talk to Mickey.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
From the magazine?
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
This is Miss Costello...?
Yes.  Price...
Pardon?
Kathy Price.
We find that your subscription lapsed...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
Still looking.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
The TV didn't work.
What Hotel are you staying at?
And what are you?  A cop?
I'm a lawyer.
Really.  How wonderful for you.
Yes.  It was, actually.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
You just got lucky.   D'you eat yet?  Come on.
Maybe I can do something right.
Is this a bad time.
...and is that serious?
Do you want me to go...?
No, no, I'm just...
I've got to work.
Yes.
Isn't there something you...
That's what I am.
Yes.
I...do you want me to leave?
Is there going to be a later...?
Not if you don't grow up...
If I don't 'grow up...'
Stop pressuring me...
No...no...
I don't have a goddamned idea.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
Where is he?
What do you want?
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
Don't touch anything.
...I'm going to need your help...
What?
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
You got a good memory, Franky.
I had a good teacher.  McLean versus Urban Transport...
Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
I'm going to get laid.
Oh shit, what's today?
I can't talk now.
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I'm swell.
That's right.
Yeah.  I'm awake.
Rooney's protecting someone.  Who is she protecting?
What difference can that make...? All right...
What did she do?
The broad has disappeared...
The Hospital...?
We got to talk.
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
It's locked?
... I'm sure you do ...
Yes.  Yes, I have.
She did?
I just saw her.
In New York?
Hi.  How are you doing?
You live in the neighborhood?
Four.  You're great with these kids.
Mrs...
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes.
Yes...
Kathy Costello.  That's my maiden name.
What did she say?
Yes.
A single hour.
Yes.
Yeah.
That's for sure, Frank.
Yes.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
...of the procedures...
Yes, the roving nurse...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
What happened in those three minutes...?
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
Huh.  And why is that?
So far you're great.  You got a cigarette?
I'll give you another complication: he still is.
I married into it.
You don't have to do it for a living.
Almost a year.
And you like it.
No, I'm all right.
Someone dead.
It's not my line.
Yes.
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
She is not my wife.
She... went into the Bay.
Did she hurt herself?
What for? Who are you?
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!
What about?
Why?
You won't have to.
Your name. And --
Judy Barton.
Who you are --
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
It's a place to live, that's all.
But you haven't lived here long.
About three years.
But before! Where did you live before!?!
I want to know who you are.
No, you don't owe me anything.
Then will you for me?
Dinner... and what else?
Just dinner.
Because I remind you of her?
Because I'd like to have dinner with you.
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
Mmm.
Okay.
Can I see you tomorrow?
Tomorrow night? Well --
Tomorrow morning.
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
No? Then what?
That's not very complimentary, either.
But Scottie, you don't have to!
I want to! Come on!
No, it's not right.
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
But why?
We'll take it! Will it fit?
Ah, no!
Wherever you'd like...
Ernie's?
Well, after all, it's "our place."
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
Too late. I've got my face on.
All in good time.
How does it work?
Can't you see?
Oh, yeah. There.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
No, it's all right.
To complete my cure.
Madeleine died here.
No! Let me go!
We're going up the tower.
You can't. You're afraid!
I'm going to. It's my second chance.
We'll find him.
What are you going to do?
Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
I loved you, Madeleine.
Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
You...  ...fell into the Bay.
No...
At...
When?
This afternoon.
Oh... wandering about.
Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
You like it, too.
I... didn't know where you lived.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
Some people prefer it.
No... it's wrong.
...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
I enjoyed talking to you.
No! No, thank you!
What?
Meet again, sometime.
We have.
Good-bye.
Shopping?
No.
Well... anywhere in particular?
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
The oldest living things?
Why?
Knowing I have to die...
Only silence. It's always like this.
And no birds sing.
No birds live here.
No.
No, thank you.
Here with you.
The tall trees...
Have you been here before?
Yes...
When?
Long ago...
Where?
No!
What?!
Home?
...somewhere in the light.
What do you remember?
No... it's in shadow.
What else?
A grave...
Where?
I know.
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
I'm so afraid...  ...you won't let it happen...
All the time.
Only this far.
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
It's all there. It's no dream.
And it's a all real.
I love you too... too late... too late...
Too late... there's something I must do...
Why?
Let me go.
Where?
Please let me go.
Yes... you run this hotel.
Please answer my question.
Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.
How long has she had the room?
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
What car?
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
More than you think.
How do you know? Personal experience?
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
What do you mean?
Why?
I know. Everybody tells me.
Johnny, the doctors explained --
It's where you belong.
I'm having one now.
That's following a train of thought.
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Could be.
My... the acrophobia.
Okay.
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Pop Leibel.
Who?
Pop Leibel? Sure.
And she died...
For what?
Nothing to tell.
You haven't told me everything.
I've told you enough.
Out. I've got things to do.
Carlotta?
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Mmm, yeah, I guess...
Bye-bye!
Where?
Oh?
Did you need it?
Yeah.
Oh?
Oh... this and that.
What I've been doing?
Wandering.
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
What is it, a still life?
No, not exactly. Want to see?
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
But you said grey, sir.
Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
I thought so!
Excellent.
I need a drink.
Don't touch her. Call 911.
That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!
What?
I said how's it going?
I didn't hear you.
Well that's what I said.
Sorry Fish.
You're an asshole.
Name one.
I don't have to...
Why was the floor wet?
I don't know why the floor was wet!
It's sacrilegious.
You're pathetic.
Don't point at me.
The hell you do.
The hell I don't.
And you're a little fucking reject.
Eat my ass!
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
You go home!
You want to hear me out?
You don't know what you're doing.
What?
What are you doing?
What are you talking about?
What do you think you are doing?
You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options.
Just stop.
I'm calling the police.
Sure, why not.
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
So I didn't fucking do it!
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
I'm not wrecking the transmission!
What?
We can't do this.
We've already done this.
That is absolutely not true.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
I am not flexible on this.
Alright. Let's do it.
What does that mean?
You got us into this mess.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
Don't talk to me about character.
Watch the tone fella.
Any time fat boy!
I can't do this.
At the seven-eleven.
Who? What are you talking about?
Nobody's smoking anybody out.
I got children. I've got a life.
They're driving me nuts!
They're singing.
They're screaming for Starbursts.
Later.
There is no candy!
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
No...we want padded chairs...okay?
No. I think it's fucked.
I won't do it.
Don't eyeball your kids.
If anything ever happens to me...
What happened? Oh my God...
It has to be done.
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
Where's the bathroom?
There's more.
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
So where's that leave us?
Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
Don't sweet lip me.
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
Shut up Boyd! Micheal?
Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
Where is she?
So who's the lucky guy?
Who?
That's right.
She's still working?
That's right.
Sweet deal.
Great. Fine. Perfect.
Fish?
Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
Not tonight.
Here's his head.
Today is the best day of the rest of our lives.
I'm not talking to you?
What is her disposition?
Give me two more.
Well, I didn't mean it.
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
No.
She's dead. Call somebody!
Shut up.
Shut up.
Good God...Good God...
I'm talking about prayer.
Go ahead.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
You always were a jealous man.
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
He is not cracking up.
Boyd...What have we done?
What did you ask me?
What?
I said, what have we done?
What?
I just want to get married.
Exactly! Exactly my point.
What are you going to do?
Take care of business.
What does that mean?
Isn't it a little late?
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
Fine? Fine what?
Whatever you say Kojak.
I'm serious.
It's my fucking opinion.
The hell you didn't!
Moore?
Oh really? Starbucks?
You hate women.
False.
True.
Not true.
You have a King fantasy.
New king.
Then what do they have?
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
What? What's your point?
Take Mexico.
What?
You will not screw this up.
We're not goosed.
Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
Goosed!
Goosed!
Give me the Valium.
How about my Fatburger?
The rings?
Government cutbacks.
We missed the deadline.
Can't we do it on the phone?
I don't think so.
I'm not sure.
What do you mean, you think so?
Photographer?
Sent it.
Florist?
Yup.
Caterer?
Yes.
I think I forgot the tent.
You forgot the tent?
I think so.
Why?
Why what?
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
You can't play around with these tent people.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
What else have you forgot?
How could I know what else I forgot?
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
What?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
Are we going to do this again?
I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
How do you figure?
Right before the wedding?
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
He's a moron.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
Charles Moore for instants.
I just don't see him in the big picture.
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
He's weird.
He's quiet.
He's weird.
Why? What's his problem?
He's a great chef.
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
You expect more what?
It's vile!
I've seen it on television.
Of course.
How much?
With all my heart.
Kiss me...?
Problems?
Okay.
Keith do not trivialize this.
I'm not. What's the problem?
Not padded ones.
So what do we do?
You go down there.
Go down where?
Honey I don't have the time...
I need your help.
We're leaving in three hours.
I'll call them from the road.
Do you love me?
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
Do you love me?
Of course.
Have a nice bachelor party.
Hi.
Not yet.
Well I do.
Well you should.
What are you doing?
Just a bit of organizing.
Nesting?
Yeah. Nesting.
I'm mad at you.
Go have fun. Not too much.
Hey. It's me.
Where are you?
What about the chairs?
Okay.
What okay?
What!
The chairs.
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
"At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."
Well, can you come back inside?
Yeah. Sure.
Now?
Are they fighting?
No baby. We'll all be right in.
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
Can we just talk this out?
I know.
I won't even discuss it.
Okay. Okay.
Yes.
Do you love me?
What?
Do you love me?
What kind of stupid question is that?
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
The prostitute.
You fucked a prostitute?
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
You killed a prostitute.
Micheal, by accident.
Call the police.
It's too late.
What money?
What does that mean?
So what do we do?
Move the bodies?
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
Just kills me...
I love you dad.
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
What does that mean?
It means she's insecure.
About what?
He's your brother.
So?
Go for it.
Come on.
I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
At the newsstand on 3rd.
Buzzing?
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
How do you know she's dead.
What?
I have no idea.
Greenpeace.
Greenpeace?
Downstairs in the closet.
All week long.
Where?
That's what I'm thinking.
"You Send Me."
The post-Vegas Man.
Okay boys, smile!
So where to on the honeymoon?
Drum banging real times.
It was an accident!
That's right.
I KILLED MY BROTHER!
You'd like me to kill them?
It's a present from my parents.
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
What's that?
Enedina and Paco ...
What about them?
That one.
You'll think you're still at the convent.
No. Mother Superior told me to come.
No.
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
You see, even the voice.
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
Never.
Don't worry. He won't be forgotten.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
Don't go!
Go away! Leave me alone.
I've listened to you long enough. Let me out.
Yes, sir. Good night.
Yes, sir.
It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
She won't even know.
Yes.
I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
Fifteen yards.
That's fifteen by seven?
That's it.
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
That's good land.
Thank you; but it's missing something.
That doesn't matter; I like it.
He was asking for it.
But why? Why?
Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
Why the bad temper?
It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
What are you going to do?
You should have enough to do in this house ... Come here and listen to this.
That your cousin is more to your taste.
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
If you free me, you'll be a rich man ...
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
Are you Jorge?
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
I'm not interested. Do what you think's best.
I know that you used to work with an architect.
Leave him alone.
They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you.
Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
She's left.
Is she coming back?
No.
Why?
And let him get run over by somebody else?
Canelo!
They told me it isn't at the hospital.
Stop this!
He's lying through his ass!
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
You cannot leave ...
Why not?
Come with me.
I'm afraid.
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
A black bull came.
A black bull!
Very, very?
Yes -- very, very big!
He couldn't get through the door, then?
You little liar! Get out of here!
They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
This louse is looking for trouble.
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
A suicide is horrible. I know. But you should have told me.
You are forgiven. Goodbye.
Good, then let's go!
Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
I'm only good at making people laugh.
Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
Ah! Pleased to meet you.
I have a headache.
That will soon pass. It's nothing.
Today, a good girl.
Yes, yes, I saw you!
You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.
Catch him and your record's clean.
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
Why would they be going there?
I don't know.
I wish we could hear them.
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
He was a computer program for crissake.
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
Do me a favor  keep sending them.
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
It's too early in the morning for me to be cordial. You got any coffee?
If you can catch him.
Fine  you want to stay here?
Where's my gun?
If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
I don't set policy.  You have the key?
Not from in here.
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
He hears...everything.
As a matter of fact, I do.
Do I get to see it or not?
You're...such a wimp.
It feels so.. .real.
Separate the character module from the neural net...
What I need is a nymphomaniac.
How should I know?
Show me his physical sensory level.
Turn it down!
Talk so I can understand.
Think hard -- it'll come to you...
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
It was you, wasn't it?
It was me, what?
All my work is my finest.
Of course you are.
Glad to...
Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever...
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
What you need is a collar.
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?
I'm still working on it.
He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
And I'm going to make sure of it.  Give me your wrist.
How did you get your hand out?
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
What does that mean?
Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?
Stop me.
You know I am.
This isn't a game, Parker!
Tell him.
I'm doing the best I can!
Both.
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
Part of him is.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
That, or living through him...
Thanks.
You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
That's why I'm asking.
...I think so...You?
More or less.
Lindenmeyer?
My guess is dead.
Sid?
I don't know.
I couldn't tell you.
Then shoot him already.
Duck!
You won't want to watch. Turn around.
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
Do they have to look so...robotic?
<u>Lure</u> him. 
What are you saying...
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
It's the White House.
<u>Hello</u>.  What?

What can it hurt is they offend me.
I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?
Gonna be fine.  Gonna be fine, people?  Are we getting there...?
...can we have a white one...?
Can we have a white one, please...
What'd ya think?
All we have to do now is sell it to the President.
Hi, How are ya?  <u>Listen</u> to this, willya...
Indeed it is.
...like the <u>sound</u> of it, eh...
...and...
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
Come on.
...where?
Come on.
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
...the Harvester... 
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
And <u>what</u> is bigger than a triumphal Homecoming...?
John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....
Who's got the story? 
Don't you want to know if it's true?
All I need is the one day.
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?
And you?
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
I'm working on it.
I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
....we landing?
Tell me again.
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
Who would find out?
...the... 
The American "people"?
Yes
Who's gonna tell'em.
...but...
...that's the general idea.
Why?
<u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
Why?
Precisely.
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The Hostages...?
Waal, that's where you <u>want</u> em...
...I just hope...
... they're checking the ratings...uh...
...what's the Long View?
Wilfred.  We've got <u>work</u> to do...
Anything at the Airport?
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
<u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...? 
An <u>Albanian</u>, a young Albanian Girl.
No rain.
Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
<u>I</u> dunno.... Ambassador to <u>Togo</u>, somethin', <u>I</u> dunno... he...
Maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
Yeah...what was I talking about...?
How long you been up, you need a nap.
<u>Nashville</u>...?
You're tired, Ronnie.
...Stanley Moss...
...brazen-it-through...
The War is Over.
Gloria -- sell the House.  
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"... 
Fine. 
Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."
Never quit a winner.
Well, what do you want to do about it?  What do you...
Could we have you in here, please...7
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
THE GROUP WATCHING TELEVISION.
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
Out in Oklahoma.
Could if we had to.  Rather not.  Rough weather.
Heavy weather East of here.
N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?
My name is Ronald Brean.
Who're you working for?
Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
I have a question for you.
Ask it.
Why do people go to war?
Why do people go to war?
I'll play your silly game.
Why do they go to War?
To preserve their Way of Life.
Would you go to War to do that? 
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
...you the Press Office?
...Yes.
Well, that's what we're <u>doing</u> here...
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
We have some mutual friends in Washington.
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
Remember the Maine...
...uh ... No, that's...
Why not?
The... 
N'it's a crying shame.  But you <u>staged</u> the Oscars...
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"
"The Country Is At War." 
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
Because.
I'm sure they do.
What do we have that they want?
Why would they want that?
Act Two:  and then, Act Two...
We don't need an Act Two.
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
It's a teaser, absolutely right,
Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
Ten Days.  There going to be any Back End in this thing?
"Back End" ... count on it.
I saw it on TV.
...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>...
It's not too <u>clean</u>...
In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
Where is he now?
Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...
...we get our hands on him?
They got him standing by.
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Oh, you're gonna love this:
Haven't had so much fun since Live TV.
Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
All the greater accomplishment.
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
Might, if I was asked... 
Of what?
The Albanian Campaign.
...the Albanian Campaign.  This... this is history...
We <u>were</u> the Albanian campaign, John -- <u>We Were There</u>.
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
...givem what they want...But...
Speaking of that...  We're gonna need a whole lot <u>more</u> of this....
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
What <u>kind</u> of stuff?  Hello...?
Is he dead?
Uh huh...why?
We're going home.  We're going home together...
Why not?
Some'b'y'll have you killed.
What he went through in <u>Albania</u>...
He's doped to the <u>Gills</u> ...
"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
No, I'm fine... I got it together....
Naw, naw, we own the airways... 
Show Must Go On.
A proud tradition.
I'm looking for a phone...
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that.
Leave it flat, will you, Ben?
It's too clean.
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
What guards Us Against Canada...?
He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
When do you bring'em back?  Schumann.
Tell'em to fly the Inaugural Speech past me.
Leopard Skin...
It's a <u>beret</u>...
British Regiments drape their drums in Leopard Skins.
Thank God this is America.
...one minute:  Demille needs an elephant for a reshoot.
No, he's back in Nashville.
Can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>?
No problem.  Here's the...
...the pet wrangler suggested it..he's also got a...
Fine.  Good.
I believe in you....
Albania, Albania, Albania, James bond Villains.
John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi...
Jim Belushi...?
Surest thing you know.
Yeah, good good good good good.  And They're <u>So</u> <u>Secret</u>...
And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...
The hats.
A beret.
Why a beret?
"...the special detachment..." Good!  What is it?
...their Leopard Skin Berets....
Hey, <u>you're</u> getting the big bucks....  I think we're up-and-running...
...you're gonna Punch in a Kitten Later.
Why...?
...of kittens...
...for the beans, yes...
Show some compassion.
Is today Laundry Day...?
How 'bout a Cold Drink...?
Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
Lemme talk to him.  Will?  Shoe?
Is it a <u>stream</u>, or is it a...
Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
Great Charlie, any better it'd be a sin.
Yeah, but he didn't see me.
Marv,  ...I just bagged the elephant!
Anacott Steel. Buy it.
Then get out and close it behind you.
Thanks, buddy, buddy, I'm back. Say, Buddy, those optorectomies do work wonders.
Start unloading.
Sell?
Now! Tell everyone to dump!
Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
Not in here Dad... please. Later.
About what?
The FAA announcement.
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
You speak for me, son.
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
I guess it's time to hit the road.
Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
What if they call him?
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
You sure?
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
So you're hot on this stock?
What was that?
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
...and if I did, what's in it for moi?
All right, Bud... let's do it.
Jackson, Steinem...
...I can't even see it...
...finish out the game, Bud, push yourself...
Allright. Wait here...
Stick around... Larry, one of my "gang" -- Bud Fox.
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
Are you with me Buddy?
Gordon.
Oh yes, I remember you.
...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
You really do believe in destiny?
Only if I want something bad enough.
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
I don't.
That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.
Why?
Any better and I'd be guilty.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
...how do you know? You wish...
It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust me -- buy. 
Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought.
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
You told him about us?
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.
He still likes you
Businessman!
Yeah 
Just give it a break China ok? CHINA Jeez.  Can't even take a joke
It's eleven forty-five let's go
About what?  About us.
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Suffer?  We're living in America.
It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
Are you sure you wouldn't like a closer look?
Thank you Jenkins
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
And uh, your nicotine sir
Allow me sir
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Have a nice day  sir
Good evening sir.
No Jonathan.
No?
A party at a waxwork huh?
Can I give her a message?
Uh, wrong picture Tony.
Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
They seemed, closing by much 
Tony and China?
What?  Tony and China, together?
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
Go away.
Right.
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Well divide 18 into three
Six six and six
Maybe before the event, never after.
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
I'll think about it.  Now run along darling.
Oh! The virgin has spoken! SARAH Stop it!
Hey.
It's only two hours away.
I know that.
I'll come back all the time.
I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
No, he wouldn't.
I know he does.
So much.
I started seeing things.
A ghost?
No.  But once I heard...
What?
Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
Then why did you?
Because he was worried about me.
Your husband?
No.
You're joking.
Mm-hmm.
Pretty.  She's a blond.
Do you have any idea who she is?
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
You think that'll help?
Nope.
Well, that's what we're here for.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
You think you influenced her?
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
What do you think?  Guess.
Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
Toward the end.  You remember?
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
The wives.
Um...
She isn't here.
When...when will she be back?
I don't know.
I have to go.
I didn't kill my wife.
Um...yes.
I've seen you.  From the window.
Is everything alright?
I'm not...
I can't, no, no, I can't...
I've never even met you.
You do?
Right.  I'm sorry.
Very much.
What?
No.  No, I don't.
Yeah.
You know where she is?
No, I don't.
Please leave me alone.
Claire.
She never mentioned you.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
You must have been very proud.
I should be going anyway.
Of course.
Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
This is...
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
I didn't sleep with him.
...just so she could cut them off.
He was so pissed.
I came in from my room...
We were suite mates.
Good.  I'm good.
You are?
Well good.  So you're human.
Kambucha mushroom tea...
Jody--
She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
It's niiice.
What?
Seance.
Jody, no...
Telling you...
...no...no...no...
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
What?
I don't...
The planchette?
This.
Shhh.
M-E...
It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.
Jody, wait.
I think so
Jody, she's alive.
What?
Did I?
Please.
I was down in Adamant...
Adamant?
I don't know.
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
I know.
I can't believe this is happening.
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
Jody he was lying.
Three weeks.
We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
Norman Spencer.
Yep.
Three o'clock.
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
How is it?
No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
It's okay if you're not.
I am, really.
You know what I mean.
I know.
Wanna fool around?
Yup.
Shhh.
Tomorrow.
I'll be there.
Of him I think.
Did she say that?
More or less.
I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
But what if something happens?
Claire...
It's what I've been working for.
Hurry...
No, no.  It's fine.
Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
In the house.  I was scared.
Did you call the police?
I don't know.  Just...whispering.
I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
You are so brilliant.
You know what that does to me.
Oh, no...
"...for my father."
I'm so sorry.
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
What?  No.  No.
You didn't?
Did you call about the Feurs?
What's going on, Claire?
What?
No.  Look!  In the window.
A flare?
What am I looking at?
I didn't do that.
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
...Don't get all...
...like it never even happened...
Well, that's a relief.
Harvey says he's amazing.
Norman...
No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
We had a seance.
Who did?
I will NOT.
Then where is she?
Yep.
Call ya later.
Are you glad?  I'm glad.
We walked all night...
You told me that I was...
But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
What's wrong with me?
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
Yes.  The ghost.
...I'm positive this time...
...Please stop...
It's Madison Fra--
STOP IT!
Wouldn't go that far.
It's too rough.
Since when?
Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
Your wife...
STOP IT!
What?
Claire--
So you fucked a student?!
That's not what I'm sayi--
DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go!
To Caitlin!!
You should have tried harder.
Get out of my way.
We don't know that for sure.
Of course she did, Norman.  What else could it be?
What?
How can you be sure?
Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
What?
Do you know it?
Don't think so.
Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
Nothing.
I'm cooking you dinner.
You don't have to do that.
I know.
Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
Shhhh.
Mauduh...
MADISON!
:Well, they are.
But you've not told Michael.
Two what...?
But why would they do that...?
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
Rowan's mother died at childbirth. And she doesn't have. any family.
Michael, Rowan should -
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
Then tell me.  Is it Lasher....
Nothing worse than a common tool.
It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
Who is this...?
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
I wish to speak to Ellie Mayfair.
When did she die...?
Who is this...?
I under5tand.  All the same
Who the hel1 -
Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
In the coffin, my dear.  where else...?
There are things I have to know!
The lamplight.  That's all.
Better than most, I suppose.
She didn't feel them
You're a monster.
The door, Michael.  find the key...
Help us.  Do what you can.
Michael...  Help us...  The door!
Now, lasher - it is our time.
Anybody got a BP yet...?
uh - then he - be just -
Like this...?
Always loved you..
Explain this to me --- violated...?
You bastard...
It is from love.
To love, you must be able to feel.
If you knew how I yearn for that...
Go away!  I don't want you here.
If that were true, I would not be here.
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
It's too soon to know.
But I could understand. I want to understand!
Do not tell me that!
I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!
Then help me--- for his sake...
Leave me alone!
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
I do not understand...
There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
Rowan...
Harder...
Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
Yessss...
Always loved you. Rowan.  Always...
My jury's still out on that,
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
The one time I want it to work...
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
Rowan...
HARDER!
Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
Yessssss...
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
Captain's orders.
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...
Mad. for each other.
Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
Rowan...?
Goodbye, Michael.   I love you.
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
Hello..
If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
I don't think of us that way - ever.
No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
A little wine...?
Mm-hmmm...
Did you see the old man on the ---
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
Talking to me dear...?
Lock the door.  Lock it
A bit much.    Lucas.
Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.
What were you talking about...?
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
It's alright...it's airight.  He's gone, Michael...  Gone.
Go away, GODDAMNIT!
That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?
If you like that type.
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
Yes.   Partly.  It's - it's -  Stu - do you believe in ---
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
You really love this guy...?
He's got great hands.
I like him.  He can stay.
Is that a crack about our singing...?
I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
The one on the left - definitely...
Don't give me shit - what do you want?
You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
I'm sorry - I didn't think
Yes it is...
That's right...
And it can't be forged?
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
No - not all the time - I mean
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
Yes - I have had it for years.
I really don't know what to say
The touch?
I'm sorry?
Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
I'm a dentist
And how many people have you killed?
I don't know
You don't know?
No she didn't...
Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
I have something I have to show you...
Why should I?
Why not? Please - it would help me
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
Nothing could be better...
Open it...
Out - I may be some time
LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think
Yes - I suppose so...
He doesn't need to...
What was I supposed to do?
Why whats wrong with the sugar -
It's what you would do to me
No - I'll have you after
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
He saved my life you know - has he told you...
What's this all about?
So have you seen hubby recently ELLEN?
No - a dentist
No worries
Don't worry about it -
Oh...
Yes...?
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
Yes - one please.
You and your pep talks.
That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again.
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
Well, Dad said...
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
Not ever. Never.
Yeah, whatever.
What is it now?
Check it out!
Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.
Take a whiff of heaven.
I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
You'll never believe who's in there.
It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
This is a fun place...but we don't usually come here until after the orgies.
Oh, god.  Look. Look.
We reinvented ourselves.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
Jealousy is so unattractive.
He kicked major ass and you know it.
You go first.
Ladies first.  I insist.
Well. The prom's coming up.
Yeah?
And I was wondering.
Yeah?
SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
Yeah? You like?
Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible.
You know...take the pictures?
That was code for "I like you."
Things change. Now I'm taking off my clothes...all by myself.
I mean, what do you think?
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
We own a small family grocery store.
Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
We miss our family.
Of course we are.
Well, why should I?
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.
I will not have my boys arguing.
They're in the ignition, silly.
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
Some of them have to be automatics.
The one with the horses.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
Hi ho, Silver.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
And who IS Ted Nelson?
Hmmm?
What do you want me to do?
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
Hang in there, I'll think of something.
I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary.
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
Most places are, Jimmy.
Very funny.
You want it in writing?
Just a formality.
I meant biologically.
That's a crappy thing to say.
Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
--Do it. I triple-dog-dare you.
It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.
In what sense?
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
Me?
Interesting.
You never know around here.
Funny you should say "peachy."
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
Why can't you be nice to me?
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
To the best hiding place in the world.
He didn't. He had it built.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
I see.
I mean my father.
It's incredibly simple.
And then what?
I know.
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
Well? Where the hell are you?
He's on the move?
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
What about you?
I'm very aural.
Tell me more.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
Not a chance.
Come on.
Maybe someday.
But absolutely true.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
You think you're working with chimps here?
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
Let your fingers do the walking.
I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town!
What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
Only the best for my mother.
You promise you'll finish school?
I'll make you very proud.
But how would we pay our bills?
Forget the store. Think big.
Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
You called the cops on us?
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
I have only one concern...
Of course I like girls.
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
Tipping?
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
I was like a different person tonight.
You were the new and improved you.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
He was in a league of his own.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.
My job. Back off, Benedict.
Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.
People pay good money for that?
I'm just a messenger.
I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
Kelly Van Ryan...
I... You know... I...
Thanks.
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.
Suzie Toller is missing.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
You could tell me where you were last night.
Back to the land of grownups.
It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
Lombardo's settlement?
I net a guy in a bar.
You could say that.
Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
Just check out the car.
Where's the body?
We don't know that, Ray...
Ray, you heard him...
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.
Where's Lombardo?
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
Yeah, maybe, a little.
He dropped Jimmy off first?
Yeah.
So you were alone.
Yes.
I guess.
No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
What was that?
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
Yeah... okay... he did
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
I said he did.
I'm sorry?
A ride.  You want one?
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
You are.
Nothing.
I think we just need to get wasted.
Curiosity, I guess.
I'm not on your property!
Hi, Mon.
Sam!  Hi!
Whichever one I want.
You notice my new jumper?
I would hardly say you look like trash.
No thanks to you.
I miss Dad.
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
No you don't.
Yes.  God, Mom...
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
Where, the mall?
A friend of mine bought a boat.
I won't.
In back of the garage.
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
So you got my mom's money.
We have to stick with the plan.
Yes.
There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
Hello.
God, I've been calling you.
I don't know.  I want to see you...
Say you love me.
I love you.  Now give me the line.
No little girl can ever make me come.
You think that's wise?
Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
You can't...
I did.  At Blue Balls.
Will they?
Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
The one you bought at school.
And she wanted to talk.
Yes.
That's right.
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
Put Kelly on too.
Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.
Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
Can't.  Got a passenger.
Shit. Here we go again.
Didn't you see her this morning?
So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Put them all together and what do we have?
Always hoping.  Or this...
I'll work on it.
Is this leading somewhere?
My disguise.  And here...
Yes.  Now, observe....
Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
All what?
All that jumping and kicking.
It's a repeating steam cannon!
Hey, I tried the board.
"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
Uh... how long ago was this?
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
It's better than nothing.
Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.
It's not a guy...
It's a town!
That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?
Relax.  We're almost there.
I adjusted it.
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
My pleasure.
I know!  I know!
Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
Of course not.
Where have you been?
Well, sure.  Didn't you get your orders?
I'm sure we will.
My Lord, he was telling the truth!
But it only has six legs.
Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
We'll see.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
You most certainly do.
Would that include me?
Oh, I would hope not.
I've had some practice.
You bring the best out in a man.
Private train?
I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
Yes sir.
This is Colonel Richards.
Nice to finally meet you, sir.
And now the job's yours.
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
I deal with some tough customers.
How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?
Philistine.
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
The first.
Yes!
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
We'll explain on the way.
He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
It's a smelting retort.
It is?
They're coming.
When are they coming?
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
In an hour they're gone!
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
They're not after me.  They want the baby.
Just get me some horses.
Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
Let's go.
You are very important, Willow.
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
Not today, Willow.
My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
No.  I mean yes.
Let me see it.
Why not?
Why not?
You're not a woman.
My step-father's going to tear you apart.
Too bad you're not more like your father.
I'm not going to let this baby die.
Say what?
I love you.
I don't believe you.
Madmartigan.
I have no family.
He turned that monster into stone!
I will!  But I need help!
Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
As above, so below.
Good.  How long will it take?
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
Are you okay?
Farmer.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
Are you a warrior?
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
What is it?
I hate this.
I will.
Fresh goat's milk.
Absolutely!
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
Time to leave.
Because she's sick.
I thought you had her!
I did?
I won't.
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
Who?
Well what did she say?
You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
Want me to carry Elora?
I'm used to her.  How's she doing?
Absolutely not.
I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
No!
Kill him!
That's all I ever wanted!
Then I will teach you.
Burn it to a fine ash.
Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
Shhhhh!
His will.
Now use it.
No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
There's nobody here.
Just do it!
She's too powerful, Raziel
Surrender!!
Courage, Willow.
Me neither!
Ouch!  Let go of me!
I changed her already!
Who is he?
I don't know much about him.
You're the guardian, aren't you?
Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
Milking?
Cows. You know, cows?
I've seen pictures.
Good, you start tomorrow.
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
They're Amish.
John, I don't understand any of this.
Just do it!
It's been a while.
Pretty much.
Yes, sir.
Pick up the hat.
Who'd you see?
Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
You don't say.
...I want to say a thing.
What's that, Sam?
I'll be all right. You just do as I say.
I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
Sure have, Sam.
Oh, he's good.
Yeah.
What have you got?
You know who?
Maybe.
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Just us.
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
Just us.
How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
Move! Or you die right here!
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
I would not be too sure.
What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
You couldn't wait until morning?
But why?
Only the elders.
How long?
What?
Two days.
You tell him. When you're able.
Buttons are Hochmut.
Hochmut?
But Stoltzfus said...
I know what he said.
Oh. The bullets.
We had some lemonade and he left.
A real fireball.
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea.
Not long... A few days.
I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
I was being foolish?
Aren't you? After today?
That's God's way!
Here. Whenever you want them.
I didn't even know about it.
Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like?
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
Say again?
Make that 1790.
Wrong.
You'd lie to protect him.
Probably.
I admit I don't know where he is.
You're the first one he'll contact.
He's got my number.
Not yet.
But... if you had to guess?
Yes, thank you very much.
John said you're Amish.
Yes.
Oh.
His name is John Book.
No...
I have to help him!
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
I don't think she knows.
Lean on him.
All right, where is he?
Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll watch these two.
Nobody's going to hurt your son...
No... No. It is just the English way.
They are English. They don't understand.
I wish dawdie was with us.
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --
Oh -- all right.
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
Yes, darling.
If she...
If she?
Is morally, ethic'ly
Who are you?
I don't believe you!
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Goodbye, folks!
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
Oh, please give me back my dog!
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
Catch him, you fool!
Toto, too.
Whenever you wish.
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
No, they won't - honestly.
Oh --
Oh -- yes.
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
Her -- her name is Emily.
What's she doing now?
Oh, no -- no!
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
Oh, you....
Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right....
No --
Did you say something?
My mouth -- my mouth!
...Oh, did that hurt?
Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
All hollow.  Oh --
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh! Oh!
Oh --
It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
I knew you would!
You've had plenty of time already!
Yes...!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh.
The nerve.
Yes.
Hah!
It's the Witch!  She's followed us here!
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Supposin' you met an elephant?
I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
I'd sooner wait outside.
But why?  Why?
Because I'm still scared!
Oh, come on.
Huh?  What'd he say?
It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!
Ohhh!
Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
I think I'll miss you most of all.
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
It's pleasant down that way, too.
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.
Ohhhh --
Ohh!
Oh -- does it hurt you?
My, it's good to be....
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
Did I scare you?
Um-hmm.
Where's Kansas?
Um-hmm.
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
To Oz?
To Oz!
Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
Yes.  Oh -- look --
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
Here -- here --
The other side....
Yes --- there.
And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
Did you just hear what I just heard?
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
Ah --
Dorothy next!
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
I don't know.
Somebody pulled my tail.
Oh, you did it yourself!
I -- Oh --
Here --   Come on.
What was that?
Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
Fine.  He's got a plan
And you're going to lead us.
Yeah. Me?
Yes, you.
This way!  Come on!
Yeah!
Why don't you try counting sheep?
That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.
Imposserous!
It's a whatzis?
Whozat?
Whozat?
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.
I hope your tail holds out. Oh --
You don't neither --
Yeah.
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
No, her dog!
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
Ohhhh -- it's me!
No, sir!
We do.
To Oz?
To Oz!
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
Hurry -- hurry --
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Dorothy!
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Yes.
Here, Tin Man -- help me.
Ho -- ho --ho
Oh - look out.
It's a whozis?
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
Oh, dear, dear.
We'll get you together!
But how can we find her? We don't even know where she is. Look! There's....
Oh --
Come on, fellows!
Oh, no!
You put up a great fight, Lion.
Go on!
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
Yes.
Well, I --
Yes -- ....
Oh!  Help me! The balloon's going up!
Help!
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.
Bond --
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
Then its no longer a bomb?
Elektra King.
Makes her look even more innocent.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
Hes going to insert the plutonium.
Like riding a bike.
Just wanted to put him on edge...
Count to twenty.  Ill be there.
We cant.
So isnt it time you unwrapped your present?
...yes?...
Quite the opposite, in fact.
Its barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
I was the one who brought that money in...
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Who did you get it from?
Your last chance. Give me the name.
Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
Havent you heard the news?  So is she.
Yes.
A word? Im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover.
Im sorry.
Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
You dont take no for an answer, do you?
Were alright.
Youre not going to.
Its the only way out...
I know.
I think youre one of the bravest people Ive ever met.
...you should rest.
I have to go.
Then take me with you.
No. Youll be safe here.
I dont want to be safe!
I have to go to work.
Two. Shaken not stirred.
You had your chance, James. Now Im looking for a bigger thrill.
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
I dont know what youre talking about!
Soon shell be everywhere.
Five more turns and your neck will break.
It is my oil!  Mine and my familys!
Elektra, its not too late.  Eight million people neednt die.
Oh James.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
You, of course. I need some information.
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
Shes no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic relationship.
I thought you were the one in her business.
A rope!
A special job.  A...a...a submarine.
No!  Get me out!
Istanbul.
How appropriate.
Bond!
Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
Is it?
What do you think?
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
Its heading for the oil terminal.
Where it can do the most damage.
Still no contact yet.
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
I would like to use the bathroom --
Please.
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
No idea who's behind this?
Don't call me that.
Who is she?  Do you know her?
Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
We don't know that.
Hello, Adrian.
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
Not yet, there's plenty of time.
Mm hmm.
I could stay and go.
. . . And just how would you manage that?
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
Cured, yes.
Veidts complex.
Jon -- for Gods sake, what do you see?
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
I've seen them!  I've seen them in there. 
Im not.
What if youre wrong??
Damn straight!  We were heroes.
His . . . whatever.
I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
What are you up to?
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
The costumes.  Am I right?
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
Where did he go?
Those cars.  What year is this??
Everything's changed --
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
What do you mean, frame-up?
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
SHUT UP, Rorschach.
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
We should get back --  What?
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?
Janey, will you marry me?
No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
Isn't it true that you --
I don't know their real names.
I don't know their real names!
What does this mean?  What does it --
Am I free to go?
Laurie!  Good to see you.
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
Please.
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
I'm sorry about Blake.
ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
Ever see one of these before?
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
What is this place?
Looks like a diner.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me.
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
Just remember, I'll be watching.
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
The scum of the Earth.
But programmable. And expendable.
I've seen enough. Turn it off.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
What weapons do you have?
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
He gets to be the hero.
You do everything Yorgi says?
Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
We hung out last night, remember?
I'm from L.A.
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
What are you talking about?
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
We'll have to go after them.
Aren't you afraid?
He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool.
Go to the water, it's that way!
Let me.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
You can't talk to it?
A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything you say, sir.
That one I'm real familiar with.
I can see that. Why?
The corner. Anarchy 99.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
What's the deal?
Been to any good diners lately?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
It's like you said, every man for himself.
It'll work faster if I have an account number.
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
What's "Anarchy 99"?
That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
We all do.
I don't like him being here.
What are you talking about?
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
I'll tell you one thing though.
What's that?
Uh-huh.
I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
I wanted to talk to you.
I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?
Sure you are, sport.
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
I won't light the cigars - how about that?
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
By reading my thoughts?
If necessary.
What if they're naughty?
He's busy right now.
What do you say?
Not interested.
Suit yourself.
He takes his work seriously.
He takes himself seriously.
Senator?
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
Let's just say, God works too slowly.
You're backstage at the encore of creation.
To find Rogue.
How?
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
He helped you?
I'll go.
If she held on any longer she could have.
And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
A piece.  Only a piece.
Is it enough?
Enough for a test.
ALIVE.
And I'll never understand terrorists.
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
You have the wrong house.
And who might you be?
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
No!
From your office, sir.
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir?
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'
Yes, sir.
What?
MMMmmmm.
Is it that music?
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
MMmmm.
MMmmm.
Surprised?
Well... yes.
Miss me?
I...
Of course.
You have your tickets?
Yes.
Yes, don't worry.
Promise??
I promise.
Oh, darling -- so will I.
Very....very!
I hope you like large weddings.
Whatever makes you happy.
Does that mean you love me?
You bet your boots it does.
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, darling!
Darling!
Love me?
Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
Why does he call you 'master'?
No, of course not.  I just meant...
All right then!
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
Is it worth taking a chance?
I suppose you're right.
That's my good boy.
Yes!... the laboratory.
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
May I have it, please?
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
Will there be anything else?
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight.
Fron kon steen!
But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
Do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir?
A week.  Ten days at most.
Break that old man's violin.
I didn't do that.
One week at the most!?
Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
I beg your pardon?
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Very good!  Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction... why don't we proceed?
Yes?
Vermicelli.
Nineteen, sir.
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
Fron kon steen!
Are you putting me on?
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
And do you also say Fro dereck?
No, Fred ereck.
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
I see.
You must be Igor.
But they told me it was Ee gor.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
Yes, just the two.
There wolf!  There castle!
Why are you talking like that?
I thought you wanted to.
No.
The wockers with the knockers.
Wockers with the knockers???
I wonder what's got into them?
What are you doing here?
Just putting up some tea.
Did you hear that strange music?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
Must be the music room.
Could be worse!
How?
Could be raining!
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
I want that brain.
Was he any good?
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
That's not bad.
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
Thank you, Master.
More, do you hear me?
What?
Wait till he sees the bill.
Well, I don't like to see you mope.
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
It wasn't me.
You can say that again.
Yes.
... I'm glad that's...
No, no!  That whole thing!
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Act casual!
What did you find out?
Someone was playing this in the music room.
All right -- where is she?
How do you know it was a 'she'?
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
Can you play it?
Maybe...if you get here on time.
That's what we're paid for.
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
I'll bet it's a doozy.
Is everything ready?
It's alive!
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
How's everything?
MMMmmmmmmmm.
MMmmm!  MMmmm!
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.
Ja, ja.
How nice.
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
I'm not sure I...get your drift.
Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.
Well... I'll just finish unpacking.
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
I don't know.  It just woke me up.
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
What a filthy mess.
But who was playing it?
Perhaps we'd better leave.
Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
Yes!
I know.
Raise the platform, hurry!
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
I thought it was wonderful.
I think you've done it, master.
Alive!  Look at it.  I have defeated death!
What do you think we should do?
Yes -- quickly, dear!
Are you serious??
Give him the sedative!
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
I think so.
Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
Of course not.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
But, after all, you have yours.
And I have mine.
Why don't we talk inside?
Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.
It wouldn't be fair to her.
Yes, I know.
MMMMmmmmm!
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
His schwanzstucker.
Whew!  A nineteen-inch drill.
Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
Three minutes to go!
Yes.
Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
Do Something!  Stall them!
Food!
Do you have a reservation?
Food!!
Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
Yes.
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
