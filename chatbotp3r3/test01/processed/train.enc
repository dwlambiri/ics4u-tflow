Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
There.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
You know Chastity?
Have fun tonight?
But
do you listen to this crap?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
What good stuff?
The "real you".
She okay?
Did you change your hair?
Who?
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
It's more
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
Where've you been?
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
You are so completely unbalanced.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
What?
In 9th.  For a month
He was, like, a total babe
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
You set me up.
Patrick -- is that- a.
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
But she doesn't want to date.
Daddy, I --
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
Oh, God.  It's starting.
Wear the belly before you go.
Daddy, no!
Why?
The prom?  Kat has a date?
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
So they tell me...
So -- which Dakota you from?
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people go here?
You burn, you pine, you perish?
You know French?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
What about him?
What makes you think he'll do it?
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
Number one.  She hates smokers
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
He's pretty!
Assail your ears for one night.
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Cameron, I'm a little busy
What 're you talking about?
Sure
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
You makin' any headway?
She kissed me.
What's the worst?
Where ya goin?
Away.
Leave my sister alone.
Yeah
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
You need money to take a girl out
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
I just upped my price
What?
A hundred bucks a date.
Forget it.
It's about time.
How'd you do it?
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
Hey.
Are you lost?
Nope - just came by to chat
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
Who's that?
He always look so
What's this?
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
William would never have gone to a state school.
William didn't even go to high school
That's never been proven
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Have you seen him?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
Pick you up Friday, then
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
You -- covered in my vomit.
hey.  Great show, huh?
Excuse me?
That's what you want, isn't it?
You know who The Raincoats are?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Okay?
I just need to lie down for awhile
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
Why 're you doing this?
I told you
Sure, I do
Who?
Dorsey.
I thought you were above all that
Kat! Wake up!
Busy
Were you in jail?
Maybe.
No, you weren't
Then why'd you ask?
I should do this.
Do what?
Start a band?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
Who?
What are you doing here?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so --
Wholesome.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Put your right foot there --
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
A soft side? Who knew?
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
So what's your excuse?
Acting the way we do.
Something like that
Then you screwed up
How?
You up for it?
State trooper?
Fallacy.
The duck?
Tell me something true.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
What?
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Is that a request or a command?
No, I won't go with you
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
My grandmother's .
Because I like to torture you.
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
My insurance does not cover PMS
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.
Why can't we agree on this?
Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right
Parts of it.
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
Hi.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
You think?
Right.
Kat a fan, too?
Say it
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
What?!
Ever been to Club Skunk?
So you got cozy with she who stings?
You were right. She's still pissed.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
You're completely demented.
In the microwave.
Tumescent!
Have a great time, honey!
Your daughters went to the prom.
Absolutely not.
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
Your life, and that of others!
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
You can see for yourself.
I could be gone for years.
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
She said yes.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
I don't want you to wait for me.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
Can't you stay with us a little?
May I ask by whom?
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
My letters of appointment.
Appointment to what?
I want to go with you!
There'll be a time.
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
I have to explore the mainland.
How are you feeling, Fernando?
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
No...
I'm not bargaining!
You defend yourself admirably...
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
What do you see?
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Say not here!  Cuba!
You come!  You speak first!
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Chief says -- how many?
To bring the word of God.
Chief says -- he has a God.
... and also to bring medicine.
He understands.
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
God... That's in a week!
That's what it says.
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
How can you be so certain?
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
Esdras is a Jew.
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Father Marchena!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
All of them!  Just lies!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
I believed in you...
I suppose we're both old men now.
I have to disagree.
I knew you would.
New worlds create new people.
What did they say about Granada before today?
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
May I speak freely?
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
Six days ago, yes.
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You think I don't know that?
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
You tell that to them!
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Don't say anything.
I'm coming with you.
You bring the cigarettes?
...delusions and paranoia.
No, he is here.  Shit...
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
No.  No way.
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
I'm abused.  Don't you think?
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
I will if they don't send me back.
Are you married?
So...the station is empty?
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Yes, I considered it.
What about back home?
So you were never a prostitute?
What are you asking me?
Are you alright?
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
Is he your boyfriend?
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
You better get packed.
I'll make some for us.
What are you doing?
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
Who do you think, Chief?!
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
I let her take a shower.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
Chief - mind if I take her?
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Yeah, right.
I'm gonna propose.
When?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
What's he looking for?
Where is she?
Takin' a bath.
Sorry...PD only.
Only one guys checked in?
Are you hit?
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
Watch the news?
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Nah, why should you?
I don't even watch TV.
Pretty.
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
You're Polish?
My folks are.
You goin' to the escort service?
You got any better ideas?
Mind if I ride along with you?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
Two heads.
You thirsty?
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
Why not?
What would your girlfriend think of that?
I don't have a girlfriend.
My point exactly.
I'm serious here.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
So...who's Nicky?
What's your accomplishment.
I kill someone famous.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
There are two bodies found at this point.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Eddie, are you okay?
Alright.
Alright?
Alright.
Alright.
Hey, honey.
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
You're ruthless.
That's good.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Tonight.
You promise?
Okay.
See you later.  Good luck.
Thank you.
So what's unique?
Keep them out of my way.
Okay.  You ready?
You stuff sausage in it.
Are you married?
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
Tell him to put his gun down!
Let her go!  Let her go!!
How much money are you carrying with you?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
We are both from Prague.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Who is he?
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
In here, says he wants a million.
Did you hear what I said?
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
Speak English!
You said speak Czech!
How you erase this?
Get in the bathroom!
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Shut up.
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
Why not?
I'm serious.
You got that?
Emil???!
We spent it!
I can get you a job.
A job?
As a plumber?!
Robert...?
What are you doing here?
Viewer discretion advised!
Isn't he a little moody?
Yeah?
I want to hear everything he said.
I'm trying to tell you.
A cheap hotel.
What are you coming here to do?
No.  Go ahead.
What was that?
I'll take him.
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
He's my collar!
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
How did you start the fire this time?
I used an accelerant.
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Mouth's clean, too.
Clean?
He knew all along.
How long they been livin' here?
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
How was it?
Get outta here!
What the hell happened?
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
CONTINUED
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Right. Just a sec.
Okay. 
Sure, what is it?
What's up?
It's about my salary cheques.
Really.
I suppose the idea was specialized training.
That seems very unlikely.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
But not completely inconceivable?
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Are you reasonably awake?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
You're kidding.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
Hal?
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
Well, don't worry about it.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
CONTINUED
I'm having a party tomorrow.
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
When are you coming home?
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
Yes, Daddy.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Oh, thank you very much.
Thank you.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, very pleasant.
Are you quite sure?
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
That's right.
Fortunately, they did.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
That's true.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
Name?
This is three years old.
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
Yeah.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
Pay money?
I never paid for it in my life.
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
You're in a hurry.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
I hear you've got visitors.
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
You're gonna help us take him.
You lying son of a bitch...
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
You got a name, cop?
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
You here to write my life story?
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Luther was part of the gang?
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
Thank you.
I think you better put him on ice, man.
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
Now, where we goin', convict?
I don't give out the details.
Last night.
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
There.
How much?
Half a million.
We split 50-50?
Where's the goddamn car?
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
What?
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
What about Luther?
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
Why?
Notice something funny about that bus?
Do I get to kiss her too?
Hey, there she is...
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
Jack?
What the bell happened?
I lost them, that's what happened.
Which one pulled the trigger?
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
That's what you say, Cates...
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
Doesn't look like it.
When? How?
What am I wanted for?
Hey, you're right.
I'm all wet.
Hey, you know what I really think?
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
That's the way I see it, too.
You sure you want me to?
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Great place for lunch.
Yeah, one of my favorites.
No wonder you're so popular.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
Jack, wait...
Hello.
Hi, it's me...
Hey, I don't believe it.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Three more hours...
You're impossible...
Hard man to live with.
How would you know?
Hey, two days with him is enough.
Hey...
Stall.
Keep stallin'.
How hot are they?
How ya doin'?
We got a lot to talk about.
Yeah, old times.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
Don't give me this, we were partners.
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
Let her go.
How you doing, man?
You want to go outside?
How about some ammo?
Don't mess with me. How much?
Five bills.
Five.  On credit.
Give it back.
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
Corn-i-Lius?
What're you laughing about?
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
...would you like a drink?
You are a monster, Zorg!
Who are you?
I brought the girl remember?
He's a she!
So you do know her.
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
It means, "Never without my permission".
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
What kind of mission?
We have to save the world.
Good luck..
Leeloo's in trouble?
When is she not in trouble?
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
Is there anything that can stop it?
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
It's a miracle!!!
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
They really made her...
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
Yeah?
I just found a picture of you.
How do I look?
Uh... at least fifty.
So, just how big was this fare?
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
When EVIL returns so shall we.
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
Yeah?
Have you pulled yourself together?
Hello?
You little sleaze bag!
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
You have nine points left on your license..
I'm sorry..
6... 5...
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
What did you say? What did you do?
Is that all?
What mission?
To save the world.
And the third one?
Don't you open your messages?
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
I'm not going.
It's my wife.
Three of us will never fit in there!
Apipoulai!
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
You hear that?
Cornelius..
Finished what?
Learning language.
Which one?
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
Uh...
You know women normally change five times more than men.
You noticed..
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
The wind blows... the fire burns...
It's up to you now, Angel!
I'm so tired...
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
...Like love...
The cash man!
Thanks..
This is all that survived?
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
This thing solid?
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
They just landed in the desert.
Is that better?
Options.
Wait or act.
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
Drink!
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Am I disturbing you?
Got it.
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
I'm not accusing you...
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
I love you.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
... What's going on?
What happened to you?
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
You couldn't?
I don't know what to say
You're killing me...
Who are you calling?
Anything harder?
There's nothing harder.
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
Bullshit.
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
Dino...
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
A fellow investor.
That's five thousand dollars.
And they are?
I want to watch you work.
I'd rather you didn't.
What's the problem?
Where's that?
You brought the money?
Where are the women?
What are you... ?
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
You're a dead man.
Leave him alone.
Call me Tom.
I figured you share information.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
Celebrity Films.
Eddie.
Yeah, who's this?
I know what you did.
What?
I know what you did.
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
I'm gonna kill you.
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
Starting to recognize a pattern?
What do you want?
I don't know...
I want his name.
How much did he pay you?
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
Why?
What did you do with her body?
Show me where you buried her.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
Do it.
Easy enough for you.
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
Of what sort?
You are a private investigator?
They're no friends of mine.
You're asking me why?
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
You almost went over your limit.
Big date tonight?
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
How long you been working there?
I'm not a cop.
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
How much do you make now?
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
Twenty-five.
Where are your parents?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
Specialty product.
You're learning.
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
It's their Presidential Suite.
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
He's odd.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
You... you need to go to the police.
I told you I can't, not yet.
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
You've found missing persons before.
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
I'm not positive this means anything.
Hello... ?
You told me to look, so I looked.
Hello?
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
No.
What was she running from?
Why do you think he did it?
We're all like that.
Are you religious?
No.
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
Do you think the police did a good job?
How... how can you say that to me...?
What is this?
Those are her belongings.
None too discreet, is he?
Okay, I'll take it all.
No, you may not.
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
What's wrong?
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.
I'm sure they're around.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
We have matching luggage.
You've been up all night?
That obvious, huh?
No...
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
I've been working double shifts.
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
How long have you been awake?
Not really.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
Here we are.
What the hell was that?
You look great!
Rick, please.
It was Freddy.
T-T-Thanks Alice...
I don't get it.
What's wrong with me?
Something wrong with the stairs?
What is it?
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
Feeling better now?
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
I gotta get out of here.
You just stay put.  You need rest.
You don't get it, he's after me...
Excuse us, dear.
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
Hey...wake up.
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
It's lonely in there, in my room.
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
Who says I don't like you?
Where is he?
Hi, beautiful.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
You're right.
There you go.  Love you.
Where are we going?
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
How was the meeting?
Sobering...
Very funny.
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Since my little girl became a mom...
Alice!
But Dad --
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
You do good work, Alice.
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
I've got to write some of this down.
I thought about that.
Then get out!
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
Who's Jacob?
My baby!
They think I'm nuts.
Poor woman...
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
These things are wild...  What do you think?
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
Vomit?
It's okay.
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
What is it?
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
Unidentified Flying Objects.
But if they <u>do</u>?
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
We're stuck tight!
Yeah?
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
You hear that?
Somewhere down there?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Well?
Is there any way out of it?
Seems to be all around...
What course, Skipper?
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
Excuse me, Skipper---
Now they feel it...down below.
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
You're sure it's Cyclops?
What's the running time?
Right <u>at</u> him?
That's what I said!
But - what can we accomplish?
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
He did!
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
Well, I'll be - !
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
Twombley involved?
What are you boys up to?
Tell me.
I plan to. Soon.
How soon?
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
I hear Twombley got shot.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
You can't buy Wade off.
We bought you.
If you get it?
Yeah.
You might not kill it.
I used to play ball.
Yeah?
You played for the Sox?
Double A. New Britain.
Really.
They said.
Safety on?
This way.
Sun's gettin high.
No brag. Just fact.
Like you and Gordon?
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Where'd Twombley get shot?
In the chest.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
Yeah.
Where'd you get the blood?
What blood?
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Sure you did.
What?
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
I'm fucking out of here.
Those are the Hoyts.
Why do they do that?
Do what?
You know.
Break stuff?
Yeah. It's stupid.
Was it funny?
To us it was.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
It's not that.
What then?
It's stupid.
No.
I called Mommy.
Yes.
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
Are we going in this?
It belongs to Pop.
Pop?
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
No.
What do you want, then?
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Okay.
I want to go home.
That's illegal, you know.
I know.
You're a policeman.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
I want to go home.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
What's the hurry?
Huh?
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
Something bugging you?
How you holding up, Wade?
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
Want to buy?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
I won't. You interested?
You and Mel Gordon?
Lillian!
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
We should talk.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
Yeah, lots.
See. Get your boots.
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
Did you get his number?
I know who it is.
Good. Who?
Mel Gordon.
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
How's she doing?
See you tomorrow, maybe.
You okay?
You okay?
I'm sorry about what I said.
Forget it.
You don't mean that.
Call me.
Tonight. Let's get together.
Money.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
Alright. I'll think about it.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
Of course! I would've heard.
This is nuts.
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
There's a furnace.
Coffee's perked.
When did she die?
It makes me sad.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
What the hell are you talking about?
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
It don't look right.
Jack?
The other guy.
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
His office. You mean my old office.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
Just do it.
Nothing.
Sleeping.
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
Love! I'm made of love!
Call it what you want.
Yeah.
Bang!
Rolfe.
Who?
No shit.
You think Jack shot him?
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
Huh?
The night before the shooting.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
Yeah, I guess.
No thanks. I don't drink.
What about Margie?
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
That it wasn't an accident.
Then who shot him?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
I'm sure he's busy.
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
Some kids were teasing you?
Mom?
Daddy. Daddy, please...
I don't drink coffee.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
He didn't leave us.
Oooooh, I'm good.
How was...  ...the ballet?
It was the experience of a lifetime.
Alice!
Daddy...
How you doing, sweetie?
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
You read my mind.
Put your pilot on.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
Got it.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
They aren't answering their hails.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
Yes, Mr. President.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
Dead.
How many others killed?
Nine.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
why did they do that?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Stand by.
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
A dubious distinction, no?
*                     Please tell me your name.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
Now, or he dies, please.
What do you know of my husband?
I know he left you behind.
Yes
No.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
Four...
Jim...
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Stop.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
I'll not going without my family.
Sir, we stay with the President.
Can't it wait?
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
You know what?
I miss you. And I miss her.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
I don't know why you stayed.
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
What are you doing?
The fax machines.
Excuse me?
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
Where are we sending it?
Someone should give you a raise.
What's going on?
We're under attack.
Where's my family?
One.
But...
who can I say is calling?
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
Thank you for calling the white House...
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
You wanna knock of f?
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.
You give me ulcers.
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
Shepherd.
My god. I think that was a MiG.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
WE'RE HOOKED!
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
I was reading too.
Kruger, Sagittarius.
Did you feel that?
Yes I did...
Oveur.
Sir?
Elaine.
It's got to be stopped!
Ted, what's wrong?
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
Ted, we're taking off!
Ted.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
What word would you use, Elaine?
Elaine!
Ted!
Elaine, what's going on?
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
You mean...
That's right -- premature ejection.
Are you afraid?
Set!
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
I'm so excited, Simon.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
Have you got it straightened out now?
I think so.
Maybe.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
You can do it from up here, Captain.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
Negative.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
Scraps.
Can I hold him?
Sure.
He's a boy dog.
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
All right.  Here.
You're sure?
No.  Poached.  Over.
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
Sixteen 'C', why?
He's carrying a bomb.
Captain Oveur?
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
I have to see Bud Kruger.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
All right, it's a matter of death.
You can't go in there!
Don't try to stop me!
Are you on the Mercury mission?
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
Do you want to talk about it.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Ah, won't you sit down?
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Surely there must be something you can do.
Captain, how soon can we land?
Can't you take a guess?
Well...not for another two hours.
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
What did he have?
Just how serious is it, doctor?
Elaine!
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
Ted, what are you doing here?
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
I love you, Elaine.
You got a telegram from head­quarters today.
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
Rain.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
Rats! I've lost number three.
Ted...
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
See them, Elaine?
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
You promise you'll write.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Did you decide on a runway yet?
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
Oh, I can't stand it.
How ya doing, honey?
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
Hi!
Oh, I'd love to.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
Roger.
Roger.
We have clearance, Clarence.
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
Excuse me, Sister?
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Do you feel all right, sir?
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
You are Cassandra?
William Harcourt?
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
Kill them both.
Here?
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
What's this?  What's going on?
Get the picture?
And that fits?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
Why did you do it?
Who said that?
Uh, Matthew...
Back off, George.
But I-- .
Screw you.
Tell me.
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
Which one is that?  Raw what?
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
Who is he?
Yeah... I know the routine.
Your health...
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
Well, let's roll, George.
To the... to the beach?
Stop the car.
Please, I must get out here.
What was that about?
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
We?  You've taken it?
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
No!  We must do this alone.
What is this?!
... It's Harcourt.
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
But there's no more drug.
How do I look?
You think this is the guy who did it?
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Ss'kya'ta'.
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
Departmental policy.
Hope their plumbing's the same.
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
Get outta there!
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
Movement!
Position?
Talk to me, Hudson.
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
I'll go.
HOW MUCH TIME?
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
You did okay, Bishop.
Have they located my daughter yet?
No.  There's no way!
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
You son of a bitch.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
Still nothing from the colony?
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
I don't know.
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
I told them to fall back...
Sir?
Yes, Hicks?
...We're coming in.
Sir, the CPU is on-line.
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
Save it.
Let's get the fuck out of here!
The corner!  Ready?
Seventeen meters.
Well you're not reading it right!
Let's go!  Let's go!
They're in the approach corridor.
They'll get us.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Locked.
Hicks, don't let him leave.
Ellen.
Fuck you.
It's inside the complex.
Looks like it stung him.
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
Thanks.
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
Nine meters.  Eight.
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
And how are we today?
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
Casey.  She's my only friend.
You promise?
Cross my heart.
I guess we're not leaving, right?
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
Yes.  A little girl.
Where is she?
Gone.
Wah...?  Where are...?
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
Burke!  Open the door!
Mommy...Mommy?
Are we going to sleep now?
That's right.
Can we dream?
How many colonists?
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
His Grace is very angry with you.
Maestro.
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
No.
Where?
In a harem.
A brothel.
Oh!
What does he look like?
You might be disappointed.
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
How was I? Tell me honestly.
You were sublime.
Extremely clever.
Don't bother!
What?
Don't bother.
No, she's fine.
Is she a good fuck?
What is it?
I want to go!
Now?
Yes!
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
That's stupid.
Why? People fart backwards.
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
Em iram! Em iram!
No, I'm not playing this game.
What?
Tish-I'm-tee.
Eat
Yes.
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
Yes!
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
What's the matter with you?
Tell them to go!
No!
What does she want?
I don't know.
Wolfi.
Yes, my love?
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
You're not going to do this?
Who was that?
No one.
I'm not telling you.
Why not?
No. Don't answer it!
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
Give me one reason I can understand.
I can't write it!
Why not?
Then he didn't send you?
Originals?
These are originals?
Come back tonight.
Tonight?
Alone.
Some service deserves service in return. No?
What do you mean?
Why you?
He asked me to stay.
This is not his handwriting.
Am I interrupting something?
Not at all.
Money! Money!
I see that you're expecting.
Oh, yes.
When, may I ask?
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
Be careful!
He's adorable!
Behold!
Hey!
Behold!
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
I said play!
What a strange young man.
Really?
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
Just one year.
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
What a charming idea. May I see?
It's just a trifle, of course.
A-flat, Majesty.
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
What? On one hearing only?
Yes, indeed.
And German?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Would you tell me why?
Yes, sir.
Well, what do you have for me today?
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Yes, what about him?
Why are you here?
How is your financial situation?
It couldn't be better.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
Pupils?
Yes.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Oh, let's not talk about it.
Why not?
It's a secret.
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
No, really!
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
Papa, is this your idea?
No one calls you that.
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
Yes, thank you, sir.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Do any pupils come to the house?
Really? What is it he's writing?
Where does he work?
What medicine?
Yes?
Sssh!
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
Well?
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
Leave that alone!
Wolfi!
Yes.
Can I see it?
No.
Why not?
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Mio caro Adone.
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
Did you like it, then?
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
Whom did they choose?
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
Of course not.
Do you have a daughter?
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
What exactly are you working on?
With all my heart, Mozart.
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
How could I not?
Did my work please you?
How could it not, Excellency?
What work?
A Mass for the dead.
What happened? Is it over?
You mean she's not coming back?
Are you ill?
Shall I answer it?
No! No, it's him!
Who?
The man. He's here.
Finish what?
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
Do you believe in it?
Oh, yes.
Strange!
Confutatis Maledictis.
We ended in F Major?
Yes.
The Fire.
What time?
I think so.
It couldn't be simpler.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
With the tenors.
Do you have me?
I think so.
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
And that's it. Do you have it?
Do you have it?
Do you want to rest a bit?
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
I'm not leaving you.
I am so ashamed.
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
What are you doing, Herr Director?
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
Because His Majesty wishes it.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
No, but I'm the best.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Who is on this committee?
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
What do you want?
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
How well are you trained in music?
Where?
Here in Vienna.
Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Ah - you've heard that?
All Vienna has heard that.
And do they believe it?
Is it true?
Do you believe it?
Do you hear me?
You cannot say that!
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
I did.
No, you didn't!
I poisoned his life.
But not his body.
You mean that play?
Yes.
Are you absolutely sure?
I've seen the manuscript.
Where?
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
What anger?
About the ballet.
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Bravo, Your Majesty!
Here I am, my angel.
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
I can't wait.
Well, promise then.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
That lady is back, sir.
Yes, I am looking after him.
Can we come in?
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
Bene.
How did he look?
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
Dr. Hirsch?
Go about your duties.
Oh, Miss Price?
Yes, Doctor?
What exactly did he call out?
Did he say a wolf?
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
It's a full moon. Where is he?
Yes.
What did he say?
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
No, why?
Is David acting strangely?
Could you get here without any trouble?
Shall I send a car?
No, a cab will be faster.
What shall we do?
It wasn't a lunatic.
I beg your pardon?
It was a wolf.
What?
Mr. Kessler?
Yes?
You haven't eaten your lunch.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
Aw come on, Miss Price!
Call me Alex.
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
You're a very beautiful girl.
I thought you were asleep.
I was. What are you reading?
What do you dream about?
I dream of death mostly.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
How old are you?
That's not really a very proper question.
How old are you?
Twenty-eight.
I'm twenty-seven.
Now what do you want to talk about?
My best friend. My very best friend.
Shall I read to you?
Hello. You all right?
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
Not just a patient -- me.
I'm a werewolf.
Are you better now?
I'll let you know the next full moon.
My friend Jack was just here.
I was dreaming again?
I would think so.
The kitchen.
Closet.
Charming.
Bathroom.
Lovely.
The bedroom.
It's nice to see you.
Alex?
Of course.
But, David.
Do me an enormous favor?
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
I've left those pills for you.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
The next corner we can get a cab.
I should be committed.
But...
David, what are you doing?
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
We had an argument. He's being silly.
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
David, don't lose control.
Hello, Benjamin.
No.
No what?
Feeling better?
No.
How are we feeling tonight?
No.
No what?
No.
Chart says he's from New York.
I think he's a Jew.
Miss Price.
Officer, I killed those people last night.
All right, you two, move along.
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
Oh, come on, tell us.
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
Do you have bad dreams, too?
Some, everyone does.
Where am I?
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
Are you cold?
Yes.
Jack.
Well, I like it here.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
She's a jerk.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
I assume full responsibility.
Okay.
Hello.
Nice looking group.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
What about it?
It's a five-pointed star.
Ask them what the candles are for.
Right.
Go on, ask them.
Jack, we'd better go.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
Beware the moon?
What do you think was wrong?
I have no idea.
Did you hear that?
I heard that.
A coyote.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Pecos Bill.
Heathcliffe.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
No, but he was on the moors.
Shit! David, what is that?
I don't know. Come on.
It's moving.
What's the plan?
Plan?
It's in front of us.
Nice doggie. Good boy.
See anything?
Jack?
Yeah.
Where are we going?
I'll tell you when we get there.
You really scared me, you shithead.
Nice to see you.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
I'm going completely crazy.
David!
We were attacked by a werewolf.
It's you, David.
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to see you.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
Yes.
Jack, are you really dead?
Hi, Jack.
What can I say, Jack?
You don't have to say anything.
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
You look awful.
Because this must be stopped.
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
What here?
Hello, there. What can I get you?
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Sorry, love.
No.
Remember the Alamo?
No, thank you.
And what, Sergeant?
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
Yes - sure
Where's Matt?
He has?
How much?
About twenty-four thousand.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Charlie!
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
Mr. Dickson in yet?
Yes, sir.
And tell him not to delay.
We want to talk to you.
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
You understand?
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
I'm sorry, Dude, butI
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
Why not?
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
Well, you can. You always could.
running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Well
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
Why are you so anxious?
Don't you know?
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
What's this?
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
Why, Matt!
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
Now?
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
John, how's your wife this morning?
Much better this morning, thank you.
Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
I'm feeling fine this morning.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
Happy now?
Where is he now?
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Good morning, Helen.
Yes?
Mr. Sampson . . .
Helen!
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Got my letter?
Yes, thank you.
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
I haven't any.
Oh, make that uniform blue.
Looks good. How much did it cost?
I already told him I was home.
No. I won't.
You're protecting somebody.
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
My wife? What's she got to do with you?
Well, Sampson, what is it?
The lobby's half filled now.
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
Yes, sir.
Is it safe?
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
He's at a board meeting.
Hello, Helen!
Matt, come here!
Why?
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
What did you do with it?
With what?
The ten dollars.
Oh, ten dollars
No.
Oh, you think I'm lying?
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
What's keeping you?
Oh now, don't be silly.
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
They must have turned him down.
Did you say Dude Finlay?
Yes, why?
He was here?
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
Are you sure?
for the rheumatism, you know.
What time was it?
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
It couldn't have been earlier?
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
Then who changed it?
What time did you get in?
How are you fixed?
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
I guess so.
I think I may just go on to the reservation.
This is healing?
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
He's smiling.
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
Uhh, yeah it does.
We got a problem here, brother?
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
How'd they --
What have you done?
I ain't done --
Bob. I didn't...
Swear.
I swear --
He's not bad at it.
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
Nope.
The Army can hang him.
You have no shame.
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
He's planning a job.
What you sayin' boy?
I think I recognize you.
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
Ride with me, cousin?
Where you boys going?
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
Hands off your hip, Cole.
You're not scared, are you?
Not now.
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
She had a moustache.
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
Perfect, Cole.
Sorry.
I got seven thousand.
It'll be the biggest score yet.
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.
Dammit!
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
Bob, rip up some bandages.
We'll make them pay for this.
Missed you, cousin.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
Well?
Cannon or Gatling?
Which one, right or left?
Shakespeare.  He's European.
Another dozen out back.
They gonna rush us?
The safe. Now.
Of course!  Uh, sir?
What?
Where is Jesse James?
You 'um big lawman?
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
You're right, sir.
Then why can't I go in there?
On account of we're robbing it.
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
Fine. I'll just wait here.
What the --
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
Web died fighting?
What do you say, sir?
They're gone. What are you --
Mm-hmm.
That would have made an impression.
Web's dead.
I reckoned.
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
Frank, don't you have something to say?
That just might work.
"Big and older"?
You can shut up now.
You are a charmer.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
She's still talking to Jesus.
You know him?
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
How'd it go in there?
Fine. How'd it go out here?
Bob's upset.
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
This has been a good year.
Jesse, we're outlaws.
You've killed your fair share of men.
We're doing this for Ma.
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
That he was.
They're making him a hero now.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
Can't argue that.
Uncle Frank?
How much of that story is true?
Did you kill Yankees?
A fair number, Ma.
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Doc Mimms will --
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
You were little Jesse James when you left.
Jesse, are you awake?
Jesse, is that your hand?
You're sick of my company?
No! I mean, of course not. No.
A river pirate.
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Not if I find the right girl.
Where will you find such a girl?
Sparkling rocks?
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Me neither.
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
Hmm.
Aw, shucks, ma'am...
Stop it. This is just sad.
Don't turn around.
Don't swear.
Tennessee?
We're moving you tomorrow.
Last February?
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
I figured.
That's what I would have done.
I'm not hanged yet.
You cocky little bastard.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
Now let's have a drink.
Right here in church?
I like that.
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
Well, not exactly.
... too young for whisky...
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
I hope I'm not being too forward.
I just though you were awful cute.
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
They had to be dealt with!
There's only four of them...
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
Your men knew the risks.
The final route for the railroad is complete.
Parker.
Sir?
What is that?
This is him.
How did you know?
This is no game.
So you can't tell me anything?
Can't you tell me anything?
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
Stop it. I'm...
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
Pumpkin?
Yes?
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
I know. Stop it.
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Courtney? Dinner?
I can't.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Dorsia's nice.
Okay. Yeah. What time?
Eight?
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Are we here?
Yes.
This is Dorsia?
Luis is a despicable twit.
Is it a what?
Pull out.
I'm ignoring you.
Pull out, goddamnit!
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
It's a plain end, see? So?
Take it off.
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
That's nice.
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
Patrick?
Yes?
I haven't seen you around here.
You just haven't been looking.
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
Nothing like last time, promise.
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
This is nicer than your other apartment.
Do...what.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Evelyn?
Yes, darling?
Is your Evian spiked?
We should do it.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
Everybody's rich.
He's good-looking.
He has a great body
Are you using minoxidil?
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
I want a firm commitment.
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
You're really serious, aren't you?
But what about the past? Our past?
We never really shared one.
No, no, no.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
Where are you going?
I'm just leaving.
But where?
Because he dated her.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
Are you my two o'clock?
Can I help you?
Doesn't he live here?
No, he doesn't.
Are you sure?
I think you should go now.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Don't come back.
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
What exactly do you mean?
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
It's just not.
No, you...didn't?
Uh huh.
It looks so soft.
Patrick? Is that you?
Call me please, Patrick.
What...is...it?
Where are you going?
Patrick?
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
SHUT UP!
What's that, a gram?
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Leaving what?
Don't, I'll drink it.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
We are totally booked.
Oh really? That's great.
I said we are totally booked.
Late?
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
When?
After six.
Oh? And what should I say?
Just...say...no.
Come on, you're prettier than that.
What is it?
Patrick?
Who?
Patrick?
Jean?
Oh no. I have no plans.
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
You didn't give them a name.
Jean? Sorbet?
Want a bite?
Do you have a boyfriend?
Who's Ted Bundy?
Forget it.
Sorry. 
Patrick Bateman's office.
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Where are you?
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
Patrick? I can't hear you.
What are I doing?
...to the office this afternoon.
Why?
Just...say...no!
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
What do you think I do?
A model? An actor?
No. Flattering, but no.
That's...that's too bad.
Next Saturday?
She's my...cousin.
Uh huh?
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
Don't tell him you're here.
You're at Paul Owen s.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Coffee?
No. I'm okay.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Oh no, I'm okay.
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
Understandable.  Lime?
How old are you?
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Where did you go to school?
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Nice. Very nice.
Pardon me, but are you okay?
Who do you ask?
Bad habit.
Would you rather I not smoke?
No, I guess it's okay.
You sure?
Yeah...Yale thing.
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Do you feel that way?
No. Not really.
Where did Paul hang out?
Hang...out?
He had a yacht?
No, he just hung out there.
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
We were both seven in 1969.
So was I.
Well, maybe he did, huh?
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
Actually, yes.
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
Have you consulted a psychic?
Nothing.
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
So...you hang out here a lot?
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" 
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
That's not the information I've received.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Let's see...  That you were with-
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
No hash browns?
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
And?
I've questioned him.
But Marcus denied it?
He does? You're sure?
I checked it out. It's clean.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
Where was Marcus?
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
I'm so hungry.
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
Gee, uh, that's too bad.
What am I gonna do?
Listen, what's your name?
Al.
Speak up. Come on.
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
It's...it's...all right.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
Oh well, you know.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
Hey, Halberstam?
No, Owen.
Is that a raincoat?
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
You are a fanatic.
"Make" him?
You don't wanna move, do you?
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
...But?
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
That took some fun out of --
He's your boss. He's not your --
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
What!
Teddy was killed last night.
What're you -- what?
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
You think I don't know that?
I can't just walk away!
...Whaddo I do?
Nothing.
...Why?
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
That was -- different.
You look beautiful.
Milo?
Don't we have any chopsticks?
Here we go.
...wanna savor this.
It's gonna get cold.
He'll tell me when he gets home.
He wasn't acting?
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
You're interfaced with our dish.
Is it your software?
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
Milo? I'm Danny.
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
He's pretty tight with his family.
Would you like a Coke or something?
You know a lot about art, I guess.
'Think I should buy some originals?
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
How's it going?
You did this -- overnight?
Milo. What's up?
Well -- you sent for me.
You really wrote this just today?
What're you implying.
It scales, don't you think?
Did you?
Talk about work? Never!
Oh. Yeah.
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
Gary, hi.
You look a little tired.
I'm okay. It's going well!
That's great! Thanks.
You could've handwritten it.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
This is good. Who did it?
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
Hasn't affected his work, though.
Gary, don't worry, we --
Okay, #2.
Ready for number three?
Let's go.
Longitude 109 --
Wait... He knows.
Gary?
I think you should go.
You do?
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
We'll come up with the next big thing.
...You wanna work -- here?
Every entry was authorized.
Keep looking.
What're we looking for?
You calling Phil and Randy?
Come with me.
Lisa.
You know my name.
You know mine.
You're famous around here.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
Did you wanna be alone?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
Why's that?
I snuck into #21.
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
They'd frame him.
...Milo?
How close are you?
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
You mean -- break in?
Why were you snooping in my office?
I told Teddy about you.
What'd he say?
The dishes are juiced up, too.
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
That's lame, isn't it?
Meet me at the other location.
It's three years old, it --
Bring it to the other location.
Maybe it's the satellite.
Is that how Larry feels?
I met this girl.
I don't know.
So -- how far are we from the campus?
So how'd you like the house?
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
Maybe he'll get back to work.
Speaking of which...
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
That kid's the great white hope.
I could get it out of him.
Where is he?
You seem surprised to see me.
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Come in.
May I wash you?
In Japan, men come first and women come second.
Or sometimes not at all.
Care for some saki?
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
To my health.
Is it about my teeth?
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
Hey, how are you?
Good luck, Austin.
Yes?
Be careful.
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
When do I begin?
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Thank you, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Thank you, Exposition.
Right away, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Oh, yes. Thank you.
There's one more thing, Austin.
Yes?
Be careful.
What's the other?
Carnies.
My God, Austin, what have you done?
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
Yes, Basil?
Be careful.
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
That does not compute.
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
Excuse me?
My wedding tackle.
Sure.
Do I make you horny?
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
A limousine has just pulled up.
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
How do you know?
Let's go get him!
He's too well-protected right now.
I don't get it.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
I hate having my picture taken.
Fancy a nibble?
I'm sorry.
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
I am not.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
No, did you use a condom?
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
Who?
Does that make you horny?
Shut up.
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
Are you crazy?
I have something to tell you.
Lay it on me.
I love you, Austin.
Kiss me.
Danger Powers, personal effects.
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
Here, have a piece of gum.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Commander, I have to log it...
We've got a lot of work to do.
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Ow! You shot me!
My son?
Sea bass.
They're mutated sea bass.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
Blow me.
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
Great.
How's Austin?
He's asleep.
I'm proud of you.
Of course not. I was married to your father.
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
Well, it's kind of weird.
And how do you feel about that?
We don't label people here, Scott.
No, he's really evil.
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
... bottle ...
Knight ...
Black...
... death ...
Love...
Flower ...
Nature ...
... preserve...
Secret ...
... love...
Hope...
... love ...
Fear ...
... love ...
Would that I could say the Same.
You
Have we met?
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
Promised? Who promised?
May I help you, madam ...
Mr. John Steed, please.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
You are female?
As you see.
Then you can't come in.
I have an appointment.
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
This isn't a game.
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
People, too.
Hmmm ...
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
What are you trying to do to me?
The Institute ... the funding ...
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
'Our revels now are ended.'
You know, I believe she's actually jealous.
What are my choices?
Choices?
I was about to throw in the towel.
I had a spot of bother at the door.
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
I didn't. Mother did.
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
My father always wanted a boy.
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
Do you?
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
As per mother's instructions.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
No thanks.
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Is that written in his shoe?
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
Not quite. This is my field.
But if someone miniaturized the process...
That's what we were working on.
Three agents killed by bad weather...
Is that what you think?
This must be the last straw.
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
Steed ... !
You followed me.
Orders.
To kill me?
I could save you the trouble.
Because you always obey orders ...
Mmm ... what are you doing?
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
But you did suspect me.
Not for a moment.
You're playing games.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
I thought you didn't.
I'm playing to win.
No, after you.
You don't trust me?
No idea who. No idea why ...
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
What's that you're wearing?
It's called Black Leather.
What is it?
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
I'll be back ...
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
Mrs. Peel?
What kept you?
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Have you any place in mind?
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Our chaperon.
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
Peter's brother?  But --
Who's now vanished.
I was getting to it.
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
I shall need a small plane.
Oh, hello ...
We want Mrs. Peel.
Steed
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
Amnesia?
Possibly. Split personality ...
Anyone particular in mind?
Guilty until proven innocent?
Are you alright, young man?
Wonderland Weather Ltd.
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
No, please! I beg you ...
Walk over to the window ...
Let it be rain, please let it be --
The last one you'll ever see.
You're better than I expected.
I was at Harrow ...
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
One shot -- for emergencies.
That's not playing by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
If you say so.
You said ... one shot.
Aren't you forgetting about something?
You are, and it's behind you.
What's happening?
Debbie's marrying Rick.
Does Cole know about this?
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
What?
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Hey, you guys, what's going on?
Man, you're losing your audience.
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
And...
I want Debbie.
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
Five thousand dollars.
Seventy-five hundred.
Rick, I want to talk to you.
I don't want any trouble.
Oh, come on, just a little.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Great car.
The best.
I love that car.
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Yes I did.
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
Nice shot.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
Cole, we've got to talk.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
I'm going now, Cole.
God, you're a slob.
But a fabulous cook.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
Are you going to have women at your party?
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
I can't sleep.
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
What's the matter?
Good...
This is it, lady. Last stop.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
I can't trust you!
C'mon, I knew it was you.
I don't believe you.
Let's get naked.
Are you okay?
Ilene, Rick promised...
Ilene, are you crazy?
Why is Cole here?
A strange wang right in my palm.
I hope Ilene's all right.
Great bathing suit.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
Your whores never showed up.
That's it, prick lips.
Give him the works.
Gary, you're quite an animal.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
What can I be doing for you?
You're a pimp?
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
That's it.
You want to share it?
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
Yeah, I guess so.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
Oops!
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
Rick!
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
The phone made me do it!
You've been having strange sex...!
No, Brett, I...
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
Mrs.?
What's the matter?
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
Olivier's in that, right?
I'm not really hungry.
What the hell is that?
My gift to you.
Under the table!
I think you'll enjoy this table.
Rick, I'm concerned.
Oooooo.
Who was that?
I don't know.
What's this?
How 'bout this?
He look familiar?
Now, don't get into any trouble.
Hey, you guys...
Reach out and snort someone.
Who?
Debbie.
My Debbie?
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
Oh these moments do try me...
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
You know Knowlton pretty well?
Biggest in two battalions.
Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
Is he...
You gotta let me finish --
I like what you've done with the place.
My God, an actual operating 8-track.
What, you've never seen one before?
In the Field Museum once.
People actually used to pay you for this?
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
Sheep don't count.
Yeah? What about Laura --
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
Ya love it, probie?
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
Thanks.
Hey.
Roll the hose.
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
Thanks for the insight.
Brian, look --
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
I saw it.
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
I know.
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
Brian.
Jennifer.
You're back.
You look great.
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
Yeah? What have you been up to?
I work for city hall.
With grenadine, right?
When I was twenty.
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
Hey.
I could use a date.
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
You think that's really any of your business?
Well, you did invite me here.
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
Thanks for the invite.
Got anything to drink in there?
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
Hi.
I don't know anything about it.
You could check. It'd be in his files.
What is --
I'm sorry.
That's a dumb thing to say.
I quit two days ago, Brian.
What'll you do?
I don't have the slightest idea...
I'll see ya around, huh?
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
I don't have a story.
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
Where are you going?
-- Shhh.
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
Read.
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
Yeah.
Did I say thanks?
No.
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
Four months.
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
No need to be modest, Brian.
Mr. McCaffrey...
Completely out of control.
Aren't you even curious?
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
Management were pin heads.
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Firehouse.
I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
I'm busy.
He just wants to --
We gotta roll, Stevie...
They're waitin' man.
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
Stephen, what are you doing here?
Fixing my roof.
Where's Sean?
He's got piano lessons.
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
The great communicator.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
Okay.
I treated you better.
You want some coffee?
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
Look, I'm sorry I --
Putty? On both doors?
Anyway, down here, take a look...
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
Didn't think you'd make it.
Who's this?
He works for me.
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
You don't know him.
Knock it off. Now.
And old ladies?
-- Burn them.
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
What do you listen to, Stephen?
You don't know... nobody knows...
It knows us. This one knows us.
Alderman Swayzak.
Inspector.
Don't you have any leads at all?
Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
Who?
You took the chalice.
Are you all right, honey?
So what are you doing here?
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
I forgive you.
All right. What are you gonna do?
I want 15 on the Mets.
Are you sure?
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
Do you have the money?
What money?
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
He gots to be did.
You truly are a dancing fool.
Everybody say Ho!
Let's go niggers!
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
Well you did.
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
What's your name?
What do I do?
You might be right.
Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
What's wrong with him?
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
What are you talkin' about?
Meaning?
You're in this up till ya neck.
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
Good morning, Cheeba.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
No offense.
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
Nice to meet you.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
That ain't funny.
My tap shoes.
What do I have to do?
Some tap dancing, some singing.
To what?
Mantan?
How you sound?
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
What are there character traits?
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
Yep, you guessed it.
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
We think so.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
What do you want?
I want to speak with you.
Go away, unless you got my money.
Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
Good woman.  I trained her right.
Purely for medicinal purposes.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
Enough about me, what's happening with you?
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
I love you too, Daddy.
How long has my father been like this?
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
Manray!
How did you know?
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
Do you know how you will use him?
Sounds risky to me.
You getting cold feet?
I'm in till the end.
Hello.
This is the group I was telling you about.
Which one is your brother?
Just want to say good luck.
Your life will never be the same.
We both lied to him.
What do you want me to say?
Same here.
Who's side are you on?
So you have your small victory, now what?
What is this?
A gift.
Thanks.
I thought it was appropiate.
Why'd you do that?
I don't want to hear it.
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
He's just playing big brother.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
Don't make me have to use this.
He, I'm Mona.
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
Can I kiss you too?
Naw.  I'll take the zero.
You feel good, not nervous?
I feel fine.
So they can be on TV.
You sound like the media.
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
Mantan, we got a show to tape.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
Peerless, your father called.
He said that?
Yes he did.
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
No.
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
Where are you from?
Finland.
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
Let Myrna finish.
I never had a really real pair before.
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
So what's up with you and DeLa?
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
...the big apple, New York, New York.
To come back to our roots.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
She hates dem.
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
I heard ya lady is wild.
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
...no, she didn't...
...yes she did.
...I heard different, thought that was...
Around...
...too early...
...then what about...
...too late, maybe around...
...like macaroni and cheese...
...like grits and butter...
I fell out of my bed last night.
You slept too near where you got in?
I slept too near where I fell out.
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
How be dat?
I don't know who I am.
I feel a song a comin' on.
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
A lot?
So what's up with you?
What do you want to know?
Oh you do, huh?
Just a little something' somethin'.
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
No, before my time.
You don't read, do you?
Never read a book in my whole life.
Maybe you need to start.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
Why don't you call him?
You're sure this is a good idea.
Y'know what?
What?
And?
And what?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Just ask me what you want to know.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Say what, Manray?
Don't try to change to the subject.
Why don't you answer?
I know I won't be your puppet.
You can go now.
Good day to you, young sir.
Where are you bound for?
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
What is your uncle's name?
Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
I have acted as I think fit.
Has he sent the challenge yet?
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
Have you taken my message to him?
Is Miss Dugan well?
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
Good gracious!  What is this?
Your honor must lower his voice.
All Europe shall hear of this!
I have no luggage.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
Who else can give me information about you?
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
I believe they will deport you.
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
That is a trifle strong.
No.
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
Have you not a man whom you value?
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
You want my heart?
It is my only object.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
Why are you shaking?
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
As much as possible.
As much as possible?
All the same, you must name an amount.
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
Then this must be done tomorrow.
May I be quite frank with you?
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Good night, papa.
Good night, my little darling.
Papa?
Is he all right, papa?
Charming Schuvaloff.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
And he doesn't care about me?
He loves me, as I love you.
It's ten thirty in the morning.
Bill Styles...
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
What do we do?
I don't want to go --
He is the only one unaccounted for.
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
We got -- I don't know, we got separated
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
West was one thing, but this --
Yeah, right...
Why not?
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
I just don't like it.
There's no need...
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
Some.
That son of a bitch.
That'd be my reaction too --
I didn't shoot West --
I apologize --
You saw West's body.
We're not finished yet --
He -- He made me do it --
Do what?
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
Where?
Back up.
Ohhhh, I don't think so...
Cadet, what's your name!
What the fuck is going on?
Jesus, what happened?
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
So you killed him?
Whose blood is that, Jay?
Roberto, what the fuck?
You know it's not like that --
Right?
You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.
You hated West more than any of us.
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
If not you, then who?
Mueller.
That's exactly what he says about you.
Bullshit.
Look in my pack.
Why?
You're lying --
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
Full clip to the body --
From up close or far away?
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
What happened to "degrees"?
I didn't kill him --
But you didn't.
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
How do you know?
I don't know --
Where are they!
Maybe --
MAYBE WHAT --
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
You mean not enough to save you.
Tom, where are you going --
Home, I'm done.
Yeah.
That's horseshit and you know it.
They're taking your command, aren't they?
You're a good soldier, Bill.
Stay where you are.
Ah, Christ
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
He's in interrogation?
Yes.
Move him.
Excuse me?
Is Dunbar cute?
Good cop/bad cop?
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
You're right. We should sit in silence.
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Something like that. You?
I plan to grow on you.
You're off to a late start.
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
I didn't shoot West...
That bugs you too?
Little bit.
We're fucked, I know --
They got their stories straight.
Are you sure?
I pushed him too hard.
You couldn't have known --
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
Yeah.
Four --
Hardy, what are you doing --
No bodies, no West...
We need to talk --
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
You're a good man, Hardy.
What are you doing out here?
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Think it'll work?
Nah.
Maybe we shouldn't go.
The faggot speaks.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
Pike and I got separated --
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
Pike never confessed.
Enjoy your flight to Washington --
Wait --
Dunbar's telling the truth.
Who, Levi --
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
So?
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
He's not Army, it's not official --
You think he did it?
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Who is she? Where does she live?
Thank you.
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
Bloom like a flower?
You were expecting me?
You won't find a better place!
Or are you too scared?
Fine, I will.
Fine, you do it.
You get the eye?
I brought it.
Bloom!
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
How long have you known my father?
Thirty years. Maybe more.
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
Did you see that woman?
What did she look like?
Well, she... uh...
How old are you?
Promise me you'll come back.
You must be Edward Bloom.
Helping people makes me happy.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
It's okay, just leave it.
Lord, I'm sorry I...
Please. Go. Just go.
I'll...
Lucky girl.
Hi. How are you feeling?
I was dreaming.
Spooning the sherbet.
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
There was one time when I was eleven...
What's your name, Giant?
Okay.
What did she say?
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
You --  -- are in for a surprise.
You think I'm up for it?
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
So how does it happen?
What did he say?
You owe me three-fifty.
When did you ever work in an office?
I will.
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
Dad?
Son?
Dad!
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?
The river.
How what happens?
Where are we headed?
You say...
It's unbelievable.
Daffodils?
They're your favorite flower.
How can I convince you to stop?
Wait! I need those!
This is why you don't show work in progress.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
So what are you up to now?
This is it? The whole vault.
Oh. Oh.
Hello.
I'm going to get started on dishes.
I'm going to check on him.
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
Do you like it, being pregnant?
You need to go.
I'm going with you.
You don't have to.
You never told me how your parents met.
That's because most of it never happened.
Mmm.
Do you love your father?
You're not.
How did you get here?
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
How much time does he have left?
Would you say you understand Josephine?
Was she one of your teachers?
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
Is he awake?
Mom?
You first.
What for?
You know what for.
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
It's enough isn't it?
Do you want to stop?
Yes.
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
That's not a burn.
Do you like it?
Say thank you.
What? What are you doing?
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
Sorry. You've lost me...
What did he say?
Oh.  We are Russian.
Yes. I know.
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
So how long will you be in England?
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
You must have a visa or something...
You're asking for my documents?
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
Uh. Do you like England?
What was that?
Oh nothing.
Tell me.
No. It is too judgmental.
No. It's not that.
Do you believe in love?
How is bank?
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
I understand. I'm so sorry
Put the fucking kettle down.
He wants a lot of money.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
He wants the money from your bank.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
Just leave her alone.
I'm so sorry.
Is that everything?
Yes.
Yes.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
Today is bath day.
I don't understand.
Syevodnya?
Syevodnya
"Frenzy".
What's wrong?
They go.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
No I don't.
I know you just want to punish me --
I do. I want to very badly.
So you're just going to be vindictive
In every sense. If at all possible.
Where's the restroom?
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
Have you got your passport?
Give me some money.
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
Fine.
He will come back.
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
Why not?
Shut up. I'm not listening.
And? What are you saying?
And. It's wrong.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
Sometimes.
Sometimes which?
Sometimes neither.
Some... What does that mean?
So now you hate all women?
What?
I got what I paid for.
You don't understand me.
Excuse me?
Get out
You don't have to say anything
What? I... I wasn't saying...
Please, there's no... Oh.
I don't have nothing.
No.
Have you had any before?
No.
Are you scared?
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
I'm trying to quit.
I've got news for you. It's not working.
I don't want anyone to die.
Except for Small Eyes.
I don't know.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
No. I think I better just go.
Okay. Thank you.
Yeah. No thanks.
Please. Why not?
Okay. Goodbye.
You can probably buy them on the flight.
I'm sorry.
It's not mine.
It's not mine either.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
No. What? No. I know.
It's more like a date.
What does it mean?
My name's Sophia.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
You have excellent English.
What are you doing?
Yeah, I know.
Then start taking them seriously.
Lazarus?
Angela?
Yes?
I need to uh...
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
Is your niece older than 12?
This gonna get you in trouble?
You gonna sing me somethin'?
What do you need?
More cough syrup?
Hi.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
That young lady's size, right'cher.
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
Holy shit.
You gonna steal my truck?
Thought you had a skirt earlier.
The fuck you laughin' at?
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
Better?
Better'n me?
Better than what you give.
Rose... please...
YOU SHUT UP!
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
You sayin' you'll do what?
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
Teh... Tehronne?
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
How long... how long I been out?
Where's Ronnie?
Well I don't...
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
Let me say somethin' first...
You some kind'a pervert?
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
I can handle that.
They sure liked them devilled eggs.
Want another?
We drinkin' buddies now?
Still makin' jokes?
Tell me what to do.
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
What is it?
By myself?
Yeah, gal I been here before.
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
Don't think that'd be wise.
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
What I love.
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
I don't want you to let go.
This Rae... you get with her?
Shit. Who hasn't?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
Uh-huh.
He tapped that.
Naw!
How a girl get like that?
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
Or what?
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
Not like that.
Heard about this morning.
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
You won't at the square this mornin'.
So...  That your first time?
You a preacher?
This ain't gonna work.
Rae don't do this now...
Holy shit!
I feel better. Do you?
Got in a little accident.
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
I just wanted some make-up.
Thought you had a man for that.
The hell you call me?
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
Hey, hey, where you goin'?
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
What's this?
Back-up.
Get rid of it.
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
What are they doing now?
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Who do you think the Jap is?
Frank Abolofia.
Some party.
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
What'd you say?
Nick... You up?
Nick, have I been a good partner?
Go to sleep, Charlie.
Hey, when in Rome --
Let's go.
Nick, we can't just --
Let's grab some food.
This should be it...
This the right place?
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
Squid?
Joyce can be nice.
You cool, Ich?
Cool?
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
What does Charlie mean?
All right, how's the new partner?
High spirits, desire, commitment.
Give me a break, would you?
Are you expecting anyone?
Where do we start looking for this guy?
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
Nick!
Give us a break...
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
Why the hell not?
Why weren't you at the platform?
You must leave?
I've continued working on the case!
How'd you get this?
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
What'd I tell you?
Did I say that?
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
Yakuza.
She disappeared... shit!
Nick --
I want to yank Kobo.
Where does this Sugai live?
A resort city, Beppu.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
It's very small.
Big enough.
No...
Let's go.  Him first.
Start it.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
How many men?
I couldn't tell.
Joyce?
I don't know.
Someone attacked him.
Thank you.  You have one?
A wife.  She left.
I'm sorry.
What's that for?
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
You all right?
Think we'll get him, Nick?
Ich said you left.
Dead gaiijin's are big news.
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
You can count on the truth from people who don't like you.
You have a helluva way of asking for help.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
He's on duty.
Where's Ich?
I need someone to translate for me.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
And I'm supposed to care?
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
He drinks.
Where's the wife?
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
I don't remember saying yes.
They want your autograph.
We're in?
You'll get Ich killed.
I still think you're a bastard.
What if I chant?
Might be different in New York.
Keep the change.
I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky.
Guess I'm on a roll.
She's such a long way home for you.
This is my stop.
I'm amused.
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
How big a package we talking about?
This by this...
Dope?
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
It's not your job.
I want a gun.
It is not allowed.
We're police officers.
Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.
You had my help, detective.
I have to get to Sugai.
I want him.
You trust me?
That wasn't our deal.
You want him dead too.
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
He knows what he's doing.
Where?
What's the point?
Not to be trapped.
Then go get him.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
And what can he do for you?
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Would you like to be modified?
What's the problem?
I want more life, fucker.
I've done some questionable things.
Why are you staring at us?
What, Sebastian?
What generation are you?
Show me something?
Like what?
Of course not.
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
His company made us.
When do you deliver your project?
You're our best and only friend.
Where are you going, Sebastian?
What's going on down there?
He's not ready yet.
When?
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
Industrial refuse.
I didn't like her.
Yeah.
She's not with you?
Yeah.  I got it.
It's gotta be right for my customer.
Well, when do you get paid?
Soon as I finish the job.
When might that be?
Day after tomorrow.
You equipped for random questions?
Why, yes, of course.
I know all that.
What about a summary then.
Do you have something against science?
Not if it works.
And what in your estimation works?
Four years.  Which would make her termination date...
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
I think I have no money.
It's okay.  Forget it.
But I would like to buy you drink.
Vodka!
Shot of vodka, please.
Thank you very much.
Prosit.
You want to see my friends?
Sorry, don't have the time.
Prosit.
You like to kiss her goodbye.
I like you.
I like you too.
One more, eh?
How old am I?
Money?
No.  I got a problem.
What's that?
Nerves of steel.
During the road test...
Why didn't you go?
Taffey Lewis?
Yes?
What did she want?
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
What the fuck for?
It's a good job.
The best.
Does it eat?
It's artificial?
Are you apprehensive?
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
I'd never get an abortion.
Why not?
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
In your opinion.
It would be my child.
I've already got more help than I need.
Do I make you nervous?
Yeah.
I can imagine.
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
You ever take a bath with a man before?
I told you I'd come back.
Who is this?
Me and my dad.
Where is he?
Dead.
How are you doing?
What do people do in the afternoon?
Do you dream?
Yeah.  Sometimes.
Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
They could clean around the arrangement.
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
You're sick, Deckard.
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
You mean a woman?
Uh-huh.
What's a long time?
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
What difference will it make?
You know what I think?
Where the hell you been?
What's up?
Thanks.
Black?
If she is, the machine works.
I'm tired of this.
Don't move.
Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...
What?
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
A tortoise.  What's that?
Know what a turtle is?
Of course.
Same thing.
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
What's your name?
Pris.
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
You want to go home?
Where are your folks?
They left.
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
Whatcha doin'?
You look... better.
Just better.
And you live in this building all by yourself?
Methuselah Syndrome.
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
Is that why you're still here?
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
What makes you think so?
Oh, now, that's a great one!
You like it?
Bravo!
This is my new friend...
I'm Adam Webber.
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
Come where?
For how long?
Let's go talk first, Adam.
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
Bon soir, mademoiselle!
Get out of here!
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
What's wrong with you?
I just had a mental picture of...
I came on a bus.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
So far?
Yes, I'm right?
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
You don't?
Yes.
And that's it?
Wait!  Wait!
It's Perry!
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
How's that?
Oh, I could die...
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
Hey, what are you doing?!
I can't, it's yours.
Take it. damn it!
Why are you doing that?
I haven't brushed yet.
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
No.
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
See, ya.
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
How long would you need me?
Two weeks.
What's the pay?
They like Dr. Pepper.
Who are these people?
My Mom and Dad.
Wait! Wait!
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
I guess we'll need another locker.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Then forget it.
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
This is for me.
A wife?
Yes.
What for?
I don't want to be alone.
Bites what?
The big one!
It does?
Sure.
They're all divorced?
It didn't used to be that way.
When do you need her by?
Of course.
Get out!
Now, get out!!
Yes, ma'am!
Stop that ma'am crap!
Never drive again!
I was wrong!!
Is this your house?
Yes!
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
He has a computer?
May I please be excused?
All right.
The guy with the underpants!
About clothing?
No!  Not crazy!
Do I look crazy?
Not that one!
What about her?
No way.
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
Adam?!
I don't blame you!
I'm leaving, too.
What?
I know first aid!
There.
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
Hi, Eve!
Is that a birthday cake?!
Yes, it is.
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
A card?
Yes, sir.
Yes.
I've got to go, now.
How do I leave here?
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Like a painting?
No, son. A pitcher.
Then why go there?
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
Oh, boy! A jacket!
C'est bon, Monsieur.
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
Yes, father?! Yes?
...the pipe tobacco.
Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore."
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
That's what everybody believes?
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
You have very nice ceilings.
I love Lucy!
And it's called...?
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
Right on the button.
Who use to own it?
What's the capitol?
Juneau.
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
This must be very new.
Yeah.
I don't think so.
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
Not on him.
I'm not wearing his pants.
Why not? He has great pants.
I just don't want to.
Almost all of them.
Why did you park way back there?
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
You bet!
Does that work?
Good-bye, Adam.
Bye, Troy!
Bye, Adam!
You dial nine to get out.
Of what?
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
My father is a genius.
How old are you?
Thirty-five.
You don't look thirty-five.
How old do I look?
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
What?  What is it?!
The sky!!!
The sky?  Where?
Up there!!
I don't see anything!
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
Whatcha looking at?
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Say what?!
How do you do, ma'am.
I do alright.
Hello.
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
Oh, that would be wonderful!
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
Oh. A nice one, I hope.
Elbows, Son.
I'm afraid you've got to.
I'll be all right.
Are you in trouble, son?!
We have to go.
This is your bedroom?
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Well, where are you --
No.
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
He drank it hot?
Yeah.
Good god.
You got a light, honey?
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
Well, put it down and come in!
No.  They all do.
You hear that?!
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
How long will we have to stay down here?
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
Home sweet home!
What's that noise?
The locks.
Thirty -five years!
Then after that it's safe.
To go up.
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
I'm not hungry.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
You have tranquilizers?
Oh, no.
What?
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Is there a problem?
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
I've noticed.
No.  I think it's just right.
Yes!
If I...you know...
Calvin?!
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Watch this!
Hi, honey!
Calvin!
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
What did you wish for, Adam?
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
Let's eat our cake.
If we still have one.
Would you excuse me?
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
Should we say a little prayer first?
Yes, yes it is!
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
No.
Yes.
We stay down here.
We do?
Well, I am the head of this household--
--and we will--
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
He's smart.
Some time.
What are you bitching about now?
What are you doing here?
I forgot some of my stuff.
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
Stop it, you two!
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
Give me your hand.
Well, that's blunt!
I see "elegant."
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
Well, what do you think?
I think...it...works.
Just be yourself.
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
He go back to the hotel?
What's that mean?
We did not leave together.
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Where are you going?
To bed.
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
Yes, you do!
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
He didn't leave with them.
He left with Sophie.
It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
I don't think so.
Oh, no!
Gay.
What do you want to do with it?
Give it back to him.
And if we can't find him?
Have him committed.
To get some frozen poultry.
Then what?
We came back to the house!
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
Adam!!
Where?!
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
Buy it from me?
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Come into the study a minute.
The criminals are winning.
What is this? What color is it?
What color is it?
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Is Sandy part of this?
No, not at all.
Who knows you have these?
Only you and the photo lab.
You're all through with this now?
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Yes? What is it?
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
That oughta do it.
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
I wanted to see you.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
Well.
THEN WHAT?
What do you want from me?
I, I don't know.
Do you like that?
No.
Nothing. Are you alright?
Sure I'm alright. 
Don?
Thank you. honey.
Yes.
See my nipples?
You can hit me, if you want to.
Do you like me?
No.
You don't?
Hi, can I come in?
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
Oh shit.
Nice guy. Who's he?
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Look.
Who is Don?
Don? Are you in with them?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
No. I should go.
Come in.
Yes. Frank--
Do you like my body?
I'm doing it.
Are you a bad boy?
What do you want?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Does that scare you?
Shut up.
Beeeee careful.
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
I asked first.
I love you Don with all my heart.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
You called me Jeffrey.
I did. Are you?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Oh no.
It's okay. It's okay.
They hurt his head.
Who, Dorothy?
Hold me, Don.
Don? Where is he?
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Bull.
Alright, suit yourself.
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
Hello, daddy.
MOMMY!
Mommy's here.
Yes, but.
Look at these. What are these?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Those are my breasts.
Can I feel 'em?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Hello?
No thanks.
I don't want to go.
Go where?
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Hey? You like to walk.
What are you lookin' at?
Okay Frank.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Well. Okay.
I'm going out for awhile.
Do you want the car?
Can I use the car tonight?
Yeah, I know.
Would you like a piece of cake?
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Sandy?... Sandy, please.
Uh-uh.
Good to see you, son.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Am I bothering you?
Yes.
How is Central these days?
Terrible boring.
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
What happened to him?
I guess I'll see you sometime.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Alright.
Are you alright?
So, what's next?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
That sounds good.
Here's to. An interesting experience.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Oh, okay, can I call?
Okay, yeah, call.
What's with Mike?
He got a little jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
You want a Dairy Queen?
Actually. I've been in twice.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Yes.
Did you see her undressed?
That doesn't bother you, does it?
That's what I thought.
Okay, be careful.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
You better not, Jeffrey.
Goodnight.
You were late.
I'm really sorry.
What am I going to do?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
Yeah.
You like mysteries that much?
Okay.
What is it?
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.
It's okay.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
You want to dance?
I can't dance fast.
You want to dance?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Dorothy!... Dorothy!
Probably not. No. Why?
Jeffrey? What's going on?
I should go with her, Sandy.
Go ahead.
Sandy?
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
What are watchin' this junk for?
You can change it if you want to.
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
I need Il Duce.
There's ways around that.
Lord's name.
Mother Mary, full of grace.
Are ya ready?
I can't find the second one, sir.
Any tips on where these guys may be?
Where's your gun?
Chest pocket.  Shit!
Anybody you think is evil?
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
What are you saying?
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
What the fuck are you doing?
What? What is it?
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
Look again for fuck sake!
Shit.
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
You guys?
We're here brother.
Hello.
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
No ma! No!
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
Be careful.
What are you going to do?
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
Fuck!
me up the...
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"
Absolutely not.
Destroy all that which is evil...
For what?
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
I don't know they just always need it.
Is that right, Rambo?
A bit.
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
Where the fuck are you going?
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Oh, we're good man.
Yes.
Who did you kill?
So what do you think?
We've teamed up with a sex offender.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
We do not want your tired and sick.
It is your corrupt we claim.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
Rule of thumb?
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
And number three, Dolly.
Uh... two shooters!
So, what do we do now?
She was in here when it went down.
Can she I.D. them?
They were wearing masks.
Maybe the three of them had something in common.
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
How do you figure?
What?
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!
Pee...Per...Man.
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
So what are you thinkin' here?
And the pennies?
Who the...
Twist of lemon!
Chief, what the fuck is this?
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
How many bodies, Greenly?
Who were the victims?
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
Oh my god!
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
Promise me boys.
Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
Hey. You don't know that shit for sure.
Hey Murph.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
No. You sure you're okay?
Hello?
Hey, Murph.
Roc. You okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
No. You sure you're okay?
Hurry the fuck up!
This is some crazy shit, man!
Liberating isn't it?
Worst day of my life, man.
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
You bet your ass he will.
Hello? You there?
You believe?
Yes.
You feel?
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
I believe these young men are right.
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Open it!
Father, I'll do you right here.
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
Just be natural, goddamit.
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.
What color hair does he have?
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Making Hutch David Soul?
OK. That's wrong.
Dignan, it's --
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
What does Starsky say?
He says. This is he.
This is he?
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
Would they do that?
She's really kind of hot.
It's got a V-8, Dignan.
Where are you going?
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
Did you see that?
Yeah, I saw it.
I'm lookout.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
It had an alarm.
Yeah, I heard that.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
Eight dollars.
But he didn't say anything.
Is it back in?
Loop around real fast.
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
Where's the manager?
Where's the other stocker?
There's another stocker, right?
Is that the manager?
Holy shit.
Like he meant it.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
What's wrong with him?
Can I get that credit card from you?
Why not?
Because my mom gets the bill.
I don't want to use it.
Well, then cut it in half.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Yes, they are.
What about them?
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
I'll just say it.
I'll say it.
You owe me fifty bucks.
Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
Hi.
Inez, this is --
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
Which one was that?
She's from Cuba.
As long as he gets out OK.
Obviously. That's a given.
See, now we've got a plan.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
He's gone. He stole the car.
Where was it parked?
That coward. Son of a bitch.
He went back for his brother.
When'd he tell you?
This morning.
Where was I?
He told you and you let him do it.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
I can't believe he just jumped you.
I wish I'd been there.
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
She doesn't need to know.
You don't know how to hotwire.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
I think we better go home.
Don't panic, Anthony.
We've got sixteen dollars.
Sixteen dollars.
I know.
How much?
She needed it.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
That's what she is!
I know that. But --
When'd you get back?
Who's in the car?
I want you to look at this.
What exactly is this place? Freezers?
You could give somebody a concussion.
Dignan. Take it easy.
He doesn't want to fight.
Get out of the way.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
Eleven fifteen.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
Next week we'll be drinking piña coladas.
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
He was a nice guy.
As a person?
Yes. I do.
Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow.
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
You're all clear.
Roger.
We all set?
Uh-huh?
Take your second position.
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
What's happening? What's going on?
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
It's going back down.
Freeze!
Nobody move!
Help me move him.
Where's Kumar?
I don't know.
What are you doing?
You're kidding.
Come on.
I'll see you there.
What?
I'll see you there.
What are you talking about?
I'll get him.
There's not enough time.
Dignan, it's too late.
Like amnesia.
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
He did?
You got to be kidding me.
I'm not kidding.
What'd he get?
Pretty much everything.
What do you mean?
You're living on a sailboat?
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
How big is it?
Where?
What's he in for?
You're kidding.
No. I'm not.
How?
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
Nice to meet you.
That's a sharp jacket.
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
Congratulations. You passed the test.
That was a test?
How does that feel?
Did Dignan take the test?
Yes, he did.
Me?
No, that door over there.
I don't want to die.
Exactly. Woah.
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
Yeah.
We're renegades from despair.
Future Man.
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
In your backyard? How do you protect them?
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
Could you grow cinnamon?
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
Let them fight.
Are you serious?
See you.
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
There's a million places to hide around here.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
I hope not.
Where you going?
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
You think he got my license plates?
What?
Bob, where you going?
I'm not playing any more golf.
You think I'm improving?
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
Were you adopted, Bob?
Why do you say that?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Was Future Man adopted?
Let's not even talk about it.
Give him a second.
Jesus, Bob.
Yeah.
It's in the driveway.
How do you say nineteen?
Were you born in Mexico?
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
What?  What?
You're Anthony?
Uh-uh.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
What do you mean?
Where'd they come from?
The front stairs.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
Is that him?
That's Anthony.
That's your friend Anthony?
Yeah.
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
What?
Are you a fag?
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
I'm not allowed to drive those.
Not even for emergencies?
They are.
So who's going to know?
That never would of --
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
What are you talking about, Bob?
OK, Bob.
You're paranoid, Bob.
What was that all about?
The guy is fucking insane.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
Where'd she go?
I think we might of scared her.
That's my responsibility.
That's your domain.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
I paid for it.
What happened?
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
This is natural.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
Did we get it?
How much is there?
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
Bob, will you please listen?
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
Way to go, Bob!
Is he chasing us?
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
It's registered in my mother's name.
What the fuck possessed you?
Bob. Are you coming?
You can go first, Bob.
My brother's in jail.
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
How long has he been in there?
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
What do you mean get back?
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
This could be a trap.
Come on, Dignan.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
I'm going back.
Not in that car you're not.
Give me the keys, Dignan.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
I know it's not.
You don't even know his name.
Yes, I do.
What is it?
Just get in the car, Bob.
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
Come on in. What you been up to?
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
You said 48 hours!
I never agreed to that.
Bob, you're lying!
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.
I'm sorry, Bob.
Come on, Bob.
I know it, man. Hang on.
Scarecrow?
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
What's wrong with Applejack?
Is he breathing?
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
I didn't think there was an alarm.
The elevator broke.
Where's Applejack?
Applejack drove.
Do you have your own room?
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
Hold on --
Here we go.
Wait a second --
How's that 700 bucks coming?
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
How you doing, Bob?
You keeping out of trouble?
He said what?
He said you ran away from home.
26 weeks.
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Ground defense.
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
What do you mean grammar?
Yes.
Why?
Where did he go?
Who? Applejack?
What's the story?
Can't get it. It won't... 
We're closed, sir.
Where's that guy going?
He left his sweater.
Where is he? Where is Rob?
Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?
No. I just have short hair.
Is that your chiquita?
No, my friend knows her.
You like Chicanos?
You a good pool player.
Guess I'll get another Tecate.
What?
No. Just pool.
You Hoto?
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
How's the weather down there?
Mr. Henry?
Come on in!
It's locked.
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
You told me Bourne was dead.
Save it for Bourne.
Treadstone.
Never heard of it.
And what are we looking for?
Sorry to wake you.
Did he say anything to you?
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
'Why' would be enough for me.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
Why not? It was just money.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
Had to be done.
Sir...
It was staged?
Who else knows about this?
Show me again...
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
Then what?
They loved you.  And I killed them.
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
You're a liar.
You know I'm not.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
I can't let you do that either.
I have to go now.
Is this really happening?
I emptied it.
Felt a little light.
Front. Use your teeth.
So why didn't you kill me then?
What do you want?
Conklin.
Who sent you to Greece?
Pamela Landy?
I don't know who that is.
What's going on in Berlin?
You called it in?
-- car keys?
-- my coat -- but we should --
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
Conklin up front.
I'll get the book.
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
Sleep. Sleep now.
No... How?
The Telegraph office.
But we were so careful.
But you're sure?
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
We can't wait to be sure.
-- where's left to go? --
You drive.
What?
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
-- not yet --
What if it's not who you think it is?
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
I love you, too.
I wanted to kill him.
But you found another choice.
I know it's a dream.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
Who is Pamela Landy?
You hear me? I believed you.
What is this, a game?
So when was I here?
No. You never worked Berlin.
My first job.
Your first assignment was Geneva.
That's a lie!
No... Jason... please...
It's me.
Okay, how do you want to do it?
Oh, shit...
Why am I alive?
Don't need it. I remember everything.
Sounds like a threat.
We need to get in there.
Looks like he's been detained.
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
-- go -- take the van! --
Alright... take it down.
We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
You're sure?
Show me.
Here?
This is everything? Is there.
-- who? -- who else is here? --
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
Mr. Nevins?
Amnesia?
Am I a doctor, no, but...
So he fooled you.
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
What do you think? Is he coming in?
So?
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
Yes. In that order.
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
We must sue for peace.
Peace?!
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
Young Robert, we are honored --
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
He won't come.
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
Wallace has sacked York!
His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
Good day to you, M'Lords.
I'll wait... back there.
The Bruce is not coming, William.
Stephen ready?
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
Rest, William.
I rest.
That's just a dream, William!
Keep these. We're going too.
They're coming!
How many?
Three, maybe more!
Wanna stay with me tonight?
I wanna have supper waitin'.
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
Test of manhood.
Good to see you again.
A common thief.
We must run in different directions!
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
I have faced him. Have you?
Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
I want... to marry you!
I... accept your proposal!
I'm not just saying it!
This night is too beautiful to have again.
Then when?
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
And I with you. But you must wake.
I need you so much! I love you!
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
I am the Princess of Wales.
I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
Peace is made is such ways.
You will die! It will be awful!
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
I must... consult with my father.
They've tricked us.
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
Fine speech. Now what do we do?
Come, it'll help you sleep.
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
But you must have something to go on?
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
Darn it!
You know the answer to that.
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
Honey. What were you doing with that?
I don't know... I don't remember.
Something must've happened! What set him off?
How long will I be in here?
I don't know. These things take time.
I found these. The others are still in storage.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
Dad lives here?
Yes.
Are you hurting her?
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
Where are my goddamn books?
Books?
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
What the fuck are you doing?
Huh?
Oh God... what did we do?
Ouch.
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
Not since we were kids.
I've stopped a hundred times.
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Not if you remember my dad.
What do you want to know, Evan?
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
It was a long time ago.
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
Where... where are my clothes?
So it didn't feel... weird?
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
Are you okay?
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
I get it. You can drop it now.
Why's that?
Because you're... different.
I just thought you should know.
Sure you don't want your wallet?
We're really gonna be in a movie!?
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
We'll find out soon enough.
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
Just don't drop the ball, okay?
And you are...?
Smells like sex in here.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
I couldn't cut the rope.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
Look what you made me do!
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
Just get out, didja?
I come from a big family.
I thought I was the bad guy!
Lenny? Come on!
Shut up, Tommy!
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
Monsieur Rick?
How did you get in here? You're under age.
I came with Captain Renault.
I should have known.
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
He did. Captain Renault did.
Does he know that?
And you want to know --
-- Will he keep his word?
You want my advice?
Oh, yes, please.
Monsieur Rick, I --
Good.
What is your name?
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
Yes, Monsieur.
I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
No thanks, Carl.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
Goodnight.
But Sacha always puts out that light --
-- Tonight he forgot.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
Here you are.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
Er, good luck, yes.
I'd better be going.
Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
You haven't heard my offer.
It's not for sale at any price.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
And Mademoiselle?
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
We said "no questions."
And I was wondering.
Uh huh.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
How did you get in?
Richard, I had to see you.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
Put them on the table.
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
Everything is quite all right.
But why my name, Richard?
Because you're getting on that plane.
It's been a long time.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
You are very kind.
This time they really mean to stop me.
Be careful.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
He does. Could we have a table close to him?
What happened with Rick?
Did he give any reason?
He suggested I ask you.
Ilsa, I --
No, Victor, there isn't.
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
Be careful.
Sam?
He came from Paris with Rick.
Hello, Rick.
Well then, perhaps you also ---
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
How do you do?
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
And I congratulate you.
What for?
Your work.
Thank you. I try.
We'll come again.
My office.
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
I beg your pardon?
I said, ask your wife.
Well, this might come in handy.
Thank you.
Had a close one, eh?
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
I understand.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
My bill.
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
We'll be there.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
May we proceed with the business?
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.
I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
For the time being.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others.
Ho, diplomatist!
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
Mademoiselle.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
What is the meaning of that phone call?
Why? What's in Lisbon?
It was a combination of all three.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
I stick my neck out for nobody.
Yeah? What's his name?
Victor Laszlo.
Manages what?
His escape.
This is the end of the chase.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
I have my orders.
Yeah, you were saying?
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Oh, no, Rick never --
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
Oh, thanks.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
I have the letters right here.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
I have. Sit down over there.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
You think of everything, don't you?
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
Our expenses?
Where were you last night?
Will I see you tonight?
Give me another.
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
Come on, we're going to get your coat.
Make it official, if you like.
What is your nationality?
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
Hello?
Put that phone down!
Get me the Radio Tower!
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
For how long?
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
Boss!
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
No.
You ever going to bed?
No.
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Good. Then have a drink.
No. Not me, boss.
Then don't have a drink.
Boss, let's get out of here.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Shut up and go home, will you?
What's that you're playing?
Just a little something of my own.
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
Where is she? Have you seen her?
It's bad.
Worse than Warsaw.
Save some for tomorrow.
Get up.
Feels so good to lie here.
Can't.  Need water.
You've had today's water.
Do too much, I'll die.
Do too little you'll die.
Take it.
No.
Take it, damn it.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.
You're putting off the inevitable.
Fix raft first.
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
Why do they have to die for me?
I'm lost.  Goodbye.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
What's so damn funny?
It's real.
You can't make it.
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
Yeah.  A long time ago.
They're harder to do than they look.
Oh?  You've tried?
To tell you the truth -- you did.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
No.  that was the last one.
Keep painting.  Promise me.
What brings you out to the sticks?
Had a package to deliver.
I had it on the island with me.
Yeah, a long one.
I've got lots of time.
How was Russia?
Merry Christmas eve.
Four four.  A record.
You don't seem too happy about it.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
He is a cute thing.
I can't even keep fish alive.
You know, for when you travel.
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
You can't go now.
I have to.
"We're" not over-reacting.
Could you watch Jango?
That's your dog.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
There isn't any us.
I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away.
No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
Get back?  From where?
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
Right back, you said you'd be right back.
I got married.
I thought you might have.
I would never --
I know.
If I'd known you were alive --
Her name's Hannah.
There was a coffin?
That about sums it up.
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
So simple to say, so hard to do.
You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged into something.
You okay?
What will you do?
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
It means a lot...that you came.
I love you, Chuck.
You too.
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
If you say you are.
What happened to your pants?
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
Mom, this is a farm.  We've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream.
Don't you even think about it.
The place is falling apart.
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
Kamal is not here.
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
What's going on down there?
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
You what?
I'm touched.
I didn't know we had sailboats.
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
Hello?
It's me.
I beat the odds!
This stinks really bad.
Cool ropes.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
You were how long on this?
To Wilson.
To life.
That's all there is.
Digital laser readers.
What?
What, then?
Thanks.  For everything.
Permission to come aboard, sir.
May I ask, where are you bound?
San Francisco.  And you?
Only if you can afford it.
I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!
You weren't dreaming about me.
Then I wasn't beautiful.
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!
They just want you to hire some new help.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
I'm *not* a doctor!
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
You cook very well!
And that I can drive a truck!
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
What'd she die of?
What are you going to tell the little ones?
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
So, Mrs...
How many months are you?
Is your family in the apple business, too?
I've never seen a lobster.
Where's Mandalay?
Burma!
People watched the movies in their cars?
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
But you looked as if you liked it.
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
And what did she die of, exactly?
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
I *know* this was right.
It will be okay.
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
Mr. Rose *knows*?
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
I know, I'm sorry.
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
"...did." Well, okay.
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
Do you think she'll be all right?
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
I can't go nowhere.
So many children. Are they all orphans?
Wally thinks apples are boring.
I never said they were boring.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
There! You said it was boring.
I love you, Wally.
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
I thought they might take me.
You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
That's true.
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
Nobody special enough, Curly.
You mean somebody asked?
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
So here is my candidate. What do you think?
I just wanted to ask you...
Is *your* father dead?
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
But did you know him?
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
Did you know your mother better?
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
What's a nanny do?
Did you grow up around here?
No. She was an immigrant.
What's an immigrant?
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
Uh... it's the end of October.
Did you bite it?
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
What kind of plane are you flying?
A B-24 Liberator.
Liberator...
Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
I think I'd probably like the apple business.
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
They're migrants.
It's almost like flying.
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
First pregnancy?
Yes, for both.
It's obviously an aborticide.
Christ, it's oil of tansy!
Where's the name sheet?
Nobody's named this one yet.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
I don't think so.
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
I thought it was my turn.
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
"One: Please don't smoke in bed."
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
Rose Rose?
What's that?
Do you like to read?
Give men that. I know how to do it.
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
You're not yet three months, are you?
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
That's *it*?
Who cares?
Now, now. He's a good boy.
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
No autonomic effects... that's correct.
When will he be home, Major?
They told me I was too old to serve.
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
Mind your own business, Peaches.
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!
You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
I told him that you all is sick.
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.
Where do you think you're going?
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!
You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
She took off in the night!
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
What do you do over at your bank, Grant?
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
We had to finalize the deal.
Everything looks in order.
This has to happen fast.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
Let's just slow down for a second...
The standard ten.
Ten percent. Of how much?
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
And I think it's because of this redhead...
Know who I am, Jake?
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
Gee... What makes you say that?
Just the last three weeks.
It's all about the money, isn't it?
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
But there were other factors.
You're a superstitious fucker.
We were back on.
After you cut her loose.
Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?
It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
Ten is standard, sir.
The red hair... It's bad luck.
I'm going home
I told you, use less powder.
What? I can feel you looking at me.
When?
You gotta be kidding me. Her?
How much we going after?
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
She up for this?
You'll be there?
Eight A.M. flight.
Calls?
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
I have a good crew.
I can't do that.
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
I need you to stake me.
Come here. Feel this.
No thanks. I'm good.
I think I just broke my hand.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Something stupid.
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
I can't be here! You understand? I can't --
What -- What do we do?
That's not --
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
No.  What's my cut?
You get an equal cut.
What do I have to do?
What about Customs?
What the hell's his problem?
What?
And some new clothes.
You're just going to have to trust me.
He's gone.
Uh-huh.
I gotta go get a haircut.
Look at you... You want to go.
It's what I do. It's my job.
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Do you have something to prove?
How do you deal with --
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
What about what?
You tell them the "Tale".
What do you want? An apology?
Your mess.
Then shut up.
We're working for the King.
Uh...
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
We never had a problem with that before.
Him.
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
I'm sorry.
You going to have the time?
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
What?
What happened?
Eee Oott Auught!
Pretty much.
In over your head?
Can I speak to you in confidence?
Can't say.
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
The King, huh? Nice going.
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
You guys awake?
What do you get out of it?
Peace of mind.
That's it?
You sell it.
It's just insurance.
That's what I'm talking about.
What are you doing?
I'm Bella.
Jack Manfred.
Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.
Is it that bad?
Jack. Do you need a ride?
No. Thanks.
My car's in the garage.
You're shaking.
I hate cheats.
Why did you quit?
I got scared.
You called the casino a cesspit.
Ouch.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
What kind of deal you looking to?
How about five hundred.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
Eight-fifty.
She went back to South Africa.
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...
I want a job, Giles.
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
I'm working on that soccer story.
I'll try and make it.
She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.
I found her in bed with someone.
Who was he?
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
Good night?
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
Not entirely.
I couldn't resist them.
You want me drunk?
You really are a beautiful woman.
Where did you get it?
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
You're my prisoner.
I've got something to tell you.
I want to hear it.
I've got a job.
How did you land that?
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
Are you trying to read my palm?
What's the time?
How did it go?
You're shaking. What is it?
Tension. It'll go.
I loved it blond.
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
What about a drink on the way home?
I'm on at nine.
It's the truth.
The door, Jack.
Leave it.
It's beautiful. Thank you.
I hope it brings you luck.
You were talking in your sleep.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
Gambling's not about money.
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
Nothing about you.
Here...use a spoon.
Leave me alone, Marion.
Why did you take the money?
I hate public transport.
I want to buy a car.
Great.
Found a job?
Yes, I know that.
Don't let yourself down.
I've lived there.
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
To coincidence.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
Near the casino.
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
Absolutely not.
Toss you for it.
How did you hurt your hand?
Just an accident. Nothing.
He doesn't gamble.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
Which side do you like?
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
I didn't.
I'm in trouble.
What kind of trouble?
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
They mean it.
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
The point is, they want a man inside.
And I thought you were a bright woman.
And I thought you were only after my body.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
It won't.
But if it does.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
Next time it'll be my neck.
Wait a minute...
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
I'm sorry.
What for?
Is it yes?
Yes.
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
That bruise has cleared up nicely.
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
And your hand too.
Hello...
Detective Inspector Ross.
Who...
Ross.
Of course I recognised him!
You've been avoiding me.
Have I?
I'm Lucy.
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
Where to?
Where do you live, Jack?
Over the river.
You've done pretty well.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
Does Bella come here?
Hey Jack, join us.
No thanks.
Don't worry, I won't report you!
Rough day?
What happened to Bella?
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
Where did you go to school?
We check every four days.
Why four? And not three or five?
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
We do. 
Where's the magnet?
Haven't you forgotten something?
I don't think so.
Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched.
How many aces are left?
Five.
I make it six.
You want me to check?
I don't gamble.
Ever?
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
Girlfriend?
You can start Monday week.
I just want the job.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
Does he win?
He's paying out in stacks of 25.
Thanks for the information.
How do you feel, Jack?
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
What's he doin'?
The key!
Key?
Where's the fail-safe key?
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
The key, goddamit, the key!
Where is the key?
It didn't go off.
Oh, God...
What the hell?
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
Quantum is up thirty-five.
Rechannel all safety relays --
Talby, Talby, can you read me?
Check at six minutes.
Energy shielding positive function.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Detonation in twenty minutes.
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
You are false data.
Huh?
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
Well of course I exist.
But how do you know you exist?
Right!
Why don't you have more time?
To explode, of course.
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
Hmmm...
So if you detonate in...
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
I have no proof that it was false data.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
Pinback...
Yes, Doolittle.
Doolittle...
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Any of 'em any good?
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Commander Powell would have named it.
Fred.
Out where?
Veil nebula.
-- open circuit breakers --
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
-- automatic channels open --
-- Remark.
Hello, Pinback, are you there?
I need a diameter approximation.
I like it up here.
You know what I think about, Talby?
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Doolittle! Help me.
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
What was that, Doolittle?
It didn't work?
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Commander Powell? Commander, hello!
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
Sir?
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
Who are you?
Bruno's girlfriend.
Oh, yeah?
I'm on a break.
Man, you got a bad attitude.
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
What?
How come I never hearda you before?
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
Who's Camille?
Some of us are trying to sleep.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
Move it.
How're ya doin', Max.
You mean until you showed up?
It's a sweep.  C'mon.
Lemme put some clothes on.
Out there.
But I'm afraid of--
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
Same old story.  Not interested.
I ain't mad at you...
I don't get involved with guns.
I'll make it worth your while.
You're light a deuce.
You didn't...
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
Damn... Are you alright?
Can you help me get her back?
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
But why can't we stay here?
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
Sophy?  Are you okay?
Mommy, where are you?
When?
You're a thief?
Thank God.
First time I ever heard that.
I was expecting someone else.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
Sorry about your window.
Lemme get my coat.
Lauren's not my wife.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
I won't be staying.
Bent?
How do I know you didn't?
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this.
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
You need to get out more.
The other ones?
The other one like you...
A girl.
Your basic hodge-podge.
What's in it for you?
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
What's this?
I don't know what to say.
You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.
I'm looking for a lady who works here.
Know where I can find her?
I need to talk to her.
None.
Who is it?
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
Look, I don't know what you want--
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
You're also a fool.
This is not a place you wanna go.
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
Got a pencil?
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
What guys do.  'Nother order.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
That's odd...
A little what?
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
Where?
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
Unlikely.
And because he's my friend.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
Please...
They're prisoners to their genes.
They don't have a lot of moving parts.
Only one I can think of.
Not right now.
I actually know how this works.
And she bought that?
Can you put that in a bag or something?
Playing hooky again?
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
Right, the big one-oh.
Hey, Sketchy--
We gotta talk.
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
You left out condescending.
I'm the victim here.
She tells you how I've been--
How'd you get her out of town?
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
Okay, okay, okay--
I was on call. 
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
He's sick.
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
Thanks, miss.
What the hell is that?
Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
No, I mean... you love your son?
More than anything in the world.
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Hawk.
Pick a song, Hawk.
Got any KISS?
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
Sorry.
Beth? I can't believe it.
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
Right, slow...
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
What's it worth to you?
Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
What are you, high?
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.
...at twenty-thirty hours.
Any luck?
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
Shit, that dork is Jam.
Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it.
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
Now, how are we gonna do this?
What the fuck!
I found the Volvo.
No... You don't think...?
Could be.
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
Jam, listen up.
It's my Bullworker.
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Oh, hi, mom.
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
Grounded for the rest of the year?
What?!
That's it?
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
Look, you can have my wallet...
Oh, yeah! You and what army?
Gimme your gun, boy!
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Not if I shoot first!
Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
Is that your final answer?
Good morning, mongrels!
Are you AFRAID?
Hi... what's going on here?
What was his name?
Yeah.
Dr. Monnitoff?
Like a DeLorean.
Like a spear.
Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
When can I squeeze one out?
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
"The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
Dea ex machina...
What did you say?
Why did you make me flood the school?
Who is... we?
You'll know soon enough.
Where did you come from?
I want to show you something.
You have to do something for me first.
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
What happened to your eye?
I am so sorry.
Hey...
Wanna walk me home?
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
Why is that?
You're weird.
I'm sorry.
That was a compliment.
Where are you going?
And what?
Well...
That's alright... I understand.
We're moving through time.
They suspended me for two days.
So, we call them... IMGs.
Will you please talk to me?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Hey.
Hey. You OK?
My mom is gone.
Come with me.
Why? Is this about the book?
No. Frank.
Is that a cellar door?
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
You're such a fuck-ass.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
Grandma Death.
Do they know yet?
Know what?
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
Oh, shit!
Who is Frank?
Why should we care?
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
So, I met a new friend.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
His name is Frank.
I think he saved my life.
How so?
Don't you watch the news?
He said to follow him.
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
What is her name?
Gretchen. We're going together now.
How are things going at school?
I think about girls a lot.
I asked you about school.
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
What else do you think about during school?
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
Four times... so far.
How does that make you feel?
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
The good stuff.
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
But you were punished.
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
What else makes you feel regret?
That I did it again.
If God exists?
Why?
Because I'm so horny.
Where are we going, Donald?
How is that possible?
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
When will this happen?
What is going to happen?
Frank is going to kill.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
It's called "The Philosophy of Time Travel".
Yeah.
What's her name?
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Why would I tell Mom?
Because you tell Mom everything.
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
How much are they paying you to be here?
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Come again?
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
If that's what you think is necessary.
Our son just called me a bitch.
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
Excuse me?
That's enough.
Christ. Is that an axe?
Yep.
How did this happen?
Do you even know who Graham Greene is?
Rose.
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
What is this shit?
Wicked.
Is Mom okay?
She's alive, sweetie.
Where is she?!
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
You're what?!
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
Really, Loretta?
This came for you, sweetie.
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
Loretta, don't do that.
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
Amber? Here.
Yah?
Mrs. Leeman?
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again.
C'mere. I love you so much.
Bye mom.
We was robbed.
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
This, this... This is bullshit!
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Here, I didn't get any.
Here, I'll take it. It's my job.
Okay... well, bye.
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
Are we on "Cops" again?
Oh, naw. Hi.
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
Shut it up, Loretta.
Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
All right, they're makin' a movie.
You don't know where this is gonna...
We was robbed.
Annette, just use your hand.
That's right.
Okay?
Yeah.
Dakota.
Ohio...
That bitch from...
What?
All right, then.
So what was the theme of the pageant last year?
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
And the year before that?
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
This pageant's like a roach motel.
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
...You betcha. S'posed to be colder- n-a witches tit tonight...
So help me, Gladys.
...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.
Oh! What is it?
Uh, Gladys?
We need more bars!
Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
I will if you shut your piehole.
Harold!
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
He should be king!
And wear a crown and everything.
Here I am, Father.
Take a letter.
Who to?
My dear President...  read it back...
Is that all?
I'll have to enclose the check first.
Here I am, Father...
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?
Yes -- why?
In her dressing room?  Why, what could he be doing there?
What's the matter with you?
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
What kind of a dog is he?
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Half watch dog?
I don't call him, I whistle.
What do you whistle?
Oh no, I can't do it.
Did you shoot the rapids?
Then you don't wanna work hard?
You get half mine and I get half yours.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
Why wasn't I insulted?
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
She did.
Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
Now -- how many men you got in your army?
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
All right -- I'll go out and find one.
Firefly must be captured at any cost.
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
It must be done right away.
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...
That's what you think.
You swine!
Give me that again!
Once more! 
Then it's war?
Bah!! 
I don't remember.
No, that wasn't it...
Was it -- swine?
No... it was a seven letter word.
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Take a seat -- you're next. 
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
Oh, would you...?
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
Mr. Merrick, sugar?
Yes please, two.
One or two?
They have noble faces.
You won't be long?
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
John loves the house.
You stay with me.
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
Yes?
I found it.
Our man is sick. Come right away.
What is it?
Like this. 
What are you going to do?
Don't!
What happened?
He fell.  He falls.
He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
I want my man back.
You don't own this man!
Good morning, Treves.
Good morning, sir.
You've acquired a taste for this?
It's quite nutritious, sir.
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
Oh yes?
Can you imagine what his life has been like?
Do you think they'll go along with us?
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
I feel much better. Thank you.
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
I am very pleased to meet you.
How long has this man been here?
I say Freddie, what are you about?
I don't know what I've got.
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Oh, no.
She's very pretty, your mother.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
You've never been?
Have you read it?
Oh no?
You alright?
y-y-yes--
Want to come out?
Of course! You want out?
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
Thank you... very much.
What's this?
I'll have to find some more.
Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.
...Yyes
Yyyess.
Yes.
Hello...
My name is...
John Merrick.
John... Merrick
Say "Merrick".
Mmmerrick.
Say "Mmmerrick."
Righteousness...
John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm.
Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
Good evening. How are you feeling?
This... is my new home?
Yes.
The hospital?
You look splendid, John.
That's a canopy, John.
Ohhh...
Oh yes.
Who are they of?
Oh, our relatives... the children.
The children! May I see?
The Children. Where are your children
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Your mother?
Good morning, John.
Yes, John?
You want a dressing bag, John?
...my... home?
Yes, John.
You did this for me?
Is it the one you wanted?
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Mr. Treves! Treves.
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
Oh yes! It was wonderful!
No, John, not one that I can see.
Then I shouldn't change anything?
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
The workhouse.
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
No, he's very upset about something.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
Yes sir.  What's that?
A dressing bag.
Very smart indeed.
Yes. John wants it.
WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
Are you the proprietor?
And who might you be, sir?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
Open up! I know you're in there!
Ah! It's my father!
Right! Where is he?
Well... where is he?
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
It's all right! It isn't happening!
WHAT did you say?
I said welcome.
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
What are what?
Those things in your hands.
What's the matter?
WHY?
Yes.
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
It was different...
What was she like?
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
But you LOVED her all the same...
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
I've never LOVED anybody!
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
"The fifth one this week"!
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
Five this week; how many the week before?
You're as bad as my father.
Who?
Halfdan the Black.
Just give me a hand.
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
No!
I'll bring it back.
But you don't realize....
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
Of course.
Yes -- I believe you do.
The second note.
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
Then I shall come too.
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
How do we know this is the way?
We blew the Horn Resounding.
What do you see, Erik?
I see the world.
Is it night or day, Erik?
It is day, of course, Freya.
Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
And will the dead ever return, Freya?
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
A lot of people like our singing.
I'm sure it's lovely.
But you don't want to hear it.
REALLY?
We're just not a very musical nation...
Well, how d'you think I feel?
I'll tell you what...
Don't talk nonsense.
He wants to kill US!
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
But it IS! Look!
Looting and pillaging, eh?
Yes.
What about the raping?
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
Oh, get it over with.
About raping me?
About NOT raping you...
You DON'T like it, do you?
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
Scream.
Ah.
Louder.
Aaagh! Rape!
You told them I raped you -- why?
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
Why should you care?
Why... should YOU care?
What a stupid idea.
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
Why should you care?
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
"But" what?
But...
What are you talking about?
It's Halfdan the Black!
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
How deep IS the ocean?
Let's hack her to pieces.
Halfdan the Black's here!
I know!
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
It's not magic! It's just a trick!
We're missing all the fun...
What's it all about?
You talking piffle, son?
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
Who have you been talking to?
I met this girl...
It's always the women that start the trouble.
She got me thinking...
I... I... KILLED her...
Slower! In... Out...
Faster!
What are YOU doing here?
Look, the sky is blue...
It's magic.
What "magic" have you brought, Erik?
What did he say?
You must help us.
Why should WE care?
Thank you VERY much indeed.
Now stop it!
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
A magic dishcloth.
Weren't we supposed to?
No! Let go, Snorri!
You'll be sucked down too!
There is another way.
Who gets killed?
What's the matter with them?
Just say something cheerful.
Wait, Erik!
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
What do you think?
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!
What are you talking about, Erik?
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
Hey, you two! What's going on?
Look, I bagged it last week.
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
I AM one, Dad!
ROW!
She hasn't got any.
Hy-Brasil?
I came to find my grandfather.
Bye... sorry...
Yeah... well...
What's all the panic about?
It can't do you any HARM...
What do we have to do?
Do what?
Vanish into thin air?
He hasn't.
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
Same thing, isn't it?
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
Are you all right?
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
Aaagh!
Let me go, Sven.
What are you talking about?
I'm not worth risking your life for.
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
Well! Come on!
Get away, Snorri.
Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
Can't make enough swords!
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
My brother blacksmiths!
That's right.
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Together we stand!
Wasn't it, Keitel?
Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?
Sh! Hurry!
Relax!
Help!
Help!
She knows it was our fault!
It's a tradition.
But it's a responsibility...
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
Not now, Sven...
I must KILL! Kill!
KILL! KILL!
HOLD it! HOLD it in!
Well, of course he is!
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
Well, go on! Go berserk!
He drove me mad!
Well I'M certainly not, either.
Well... I'm game.
I'm not frightened... of anything...
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
No... he's not... not... there...
Yes, Mother.
And something to sharpen them with?
No, Mother.
And keep your sword greased.
Thanks, guys.
Yeah.
Yeah, you told me that later.
No, it was lovely.
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
Ms. Kruczynski?
How are you today?
Okay, I guess.
You were not.
Come over after I'm done here?
In the room?
Come up to Boston with me?
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
How are you today?
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
I'm sorry.
Why?
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
I don't really know how --
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
Huckleberry Hound?
I don't know what that means.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
Probably see you at the book store.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
It's okay.
Where do you live?
I'm not a stalker.
You know Wilmont?
Yeah.
So you like bookstores, huh?
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
I'm fine.
Ready for another?
What do you want to hear?
You pick it.
Well, I should probably get going.
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
Okay.
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
You'll call me, right?
Yeah.
When?
Yo ho ho!
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Let me drive you home.
How can you watch this crap?
Where are you going?
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
I want to have a baby.
I don't think we're ready.
I don't want to talk about this here.
So, um --
No, it isn't that.
More?
Yeah, Tangerine?
Such a beautiful view.
What if you hide me?
There's this guy!
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
Happy Birthday.
I scoured the city for it.
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
This is our first "date" date.
Do you remember what we talked about?
Yeah.
Right. Something black though.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
We did talk about Naomi.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I'm sure, I said.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
I dropped you off after. You said --
Come up and see me... now.
It's very late.
I told her today I need to end it.
Is that what you want?
Well, you're married.
I remember that speech really well.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
Hi there.
You know what I did.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
Oh God, how horrid.
I know.
What do we do?
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
I think she's great.
I think, before.
Seems too coincidental that way.
I wish we did. You married?
Um, no.
Male or female?
Cool.
What are you doing?
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
It's dark.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
What if you stay this time?
Bye, Joel.
So you'll call me, right?
Yeah.
When?
I think I should go back.
Make love?
I'm nervous, too.
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
Well, you obviously don't know me.
Says you were a bully...
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
I don't know.
I can't stop thinking about you.
What took you so long?
I just walked in.
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
I guess so.
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
Hi, it's Joel.
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
You must have been crazy.
Guess what I'm wearing.
I don't know. Panties and --
Your dried cum.
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
Hi.
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
I just got in.
It's them.
I should maybe talk to you.
Clementine.
You have to stop this!
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
Hi.
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
So you don't mind?
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
We'll speak soon.
Oh, hey, Patrick.
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
Boo.
Stan... c'mon...
Sorry. I just --
It's just... y'know... I mean...
See you later, alligator.
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
It's freezing out.
You found us okay?
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
It's stopped.
What?
Well, what should we do?
He's coming?
You better go.
Do you swear you didn't know?
How did I look?
Oh.
Hi.
What do you want, Stan?
What's this?
Nothing.
I know what it is.
Howard, your one o'clock.
Mary...
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Thanks.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
It's no big deal.
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
I have a family, Mary.
You made me have an abortion.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
Well, where was Patrick?
He went home sick.
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
Mary. What are you doing here?
I tried that already.
Did you try going through C-Gate?
Howard, they've disappeared again.
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
The voltage looks fine.
Does that help?
You can if you want.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
What's your bartlett's?
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
But I don't know how to polka.
What was that?
Clockworks.
What do you believe in then?
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
I don't.
Tell me about it.
No, I guess not.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
What do you think?
What are you doing?
I have to go, Julian.
I was a successful model once.
So now you're bummin' around?
Hitchhiking?
I'm the best.
Bonanza Jellybean?
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
I can see why they sent you along.
...do you copy?
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
Justin?
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
We have a man down...
Coop, where are you...
The containment, Second Containment...
But Justin...
Will it work?
Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
What?
Coffee.
I don't know what happened to Justin.
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
Is that an offer?
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
How? The Bridge is gone.
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
What...?
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
Please... kill...
What's wrong?
What's happening...?
Pressure?
90 over 50 and falling... .
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
Does he know that?
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
What does?
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
How do you know all this?
You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
Justin, finish your sweep.
Patch me through to him.
Justin.
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
I can see the hatch.
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
I found one.
Alive?
...how's the client?
Can anybody hear me...
Skipper...
Peters...
...you okay?
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
That's a negative, Starck.
Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
Where has it been for the last seven years?
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
No one?
If it worked.
I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
You have something, Dr. Weir?
The date.
What about it?
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
What do you want me to say?
I don't know...
We're leaving.
Don't... don't do this...
You... You can't do that!
Weir is dead.
Then who the fuck are you?
What are you?
I'm not the Devil.
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
Jesus...
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
Yes, sir.
We've got some weather.
It is now.  We're locked in.
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
Do we have enough time for a weld?
Captain Miller, you copy?
Thank you.
Captain, we got a problem.
Skipper...
Smith, get out of there...
Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
No, no, we just got her back together...
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
That's an affirmative.
Everybody okay?
It tastes bad.
Oxygen is not the problem.
Maybe one of the original crew?
No. It was someone else.
Miller...
It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
Miller, come in...
What's going on in there, Starck?
Weir can't be alive.
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
I'll do it --
We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
He's been past Mars?
He served on the Goliath.
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
Can you see a body?
No. I saw nothing.
There's no one in the corridor but us.
He's engaged the override.
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
Keep him talking.
Almost got it.
You got any coffee?
It's cold.
Where is she?
The safety circuit's failed!
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
If they are, they're screening their calls.
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
What happened to his eyes?
Explosive decompression.
Miller, do you read me, Peters --
What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
A straight line.
Claire is your wife?
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
What are you doing?
What is it?
I don't think She's real big on hate.
How'd you know it was me?
I'm not really dressed for a party.
Relax, it's casual.
We're going to have to work on your touch.
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
I wouldn't know anything about that.
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
You look like an eighties rock band.
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
Oh, he did.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
Where is Reed?
What are you doing here?
I'm worried about you.
What is this? Where's Reed?
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
What did you wish for, honey?
I can't take this.
What about his first born?
He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
Five times.
I had it at four.
Isn't that your speech?
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
He's smart, powerful, successful --
What the --!
Ben. Are you okay?
We had a tough year.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
We're working as hard as we can --
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
'Course not. Strictly business.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Reed?... Sue?
Hey! That's a prototype!
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
You're hot!
So are you!
Me like-y.
Stay right. Left is trouble.
I though we went over this.
Not this again --
He's not responsive --
Now what is up with that?
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
Back it down, Johnny!
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
But all these people...
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Stop it.
What is that thing?
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
You're really cramping my style here.
I'm driving.
You two need a time-out.
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
They're ready for you, sir.
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Feeling better?
Yes, thanks.
Which was?
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
What? What do you mean you --
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
That's what we're here to find out.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
And reverse the mutations --
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
I can... make it work.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
I found a broken gasket, from space --
Come on, Ben, come on...
Ben did this.
Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
What are you doing?
What's going on?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
Please don't make this personal --
Oh, I think you already have.
Of course.
How much did they cost?
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
I can't find it, mon!
It's the first door on your left!
On the ledge?
First door on your left!
Easy, mon.
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
This is how I dress all the time.
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
Hi, Brad.
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Your friends use the pool too.
I take out the garbage.
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Where did you hear that?
I'm just guessing.
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
I don't know. I was just curious.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
You are a virgin!
I didn't say that.
Are you still a virgin?
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Yes, sir.
Leave me alone!
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Leave me alone.
Nice to meet you, Stacy.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
Do you have any ice tea?
Pick a suit.
Are you really a virgin?
You're a really good kisser.
So are you.  Are you shaking?
Hey, Mike?
What? Are you all right?
I think we're making a lot of noise.
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
Oh. Hi.
I didn't see you this morning.
Take that back.
We've got to get an abortion?
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
It's definitely your mama.
All right... where did you see her?
Did you get her number?
No.
Did you get her name?
I would. Yeah.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
Hey, Rat.
Yeah?
Yo.
Damone. It's Mark.
Damone, are you there?
Hey, Mark. Is that you?
Well, I've gotta be running.
Poor guy.
No Damone. I don't understand.
You're losing it, Damone.
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
Are you Linda Barrett?
And they don't call my parents?
Not if you're over sixteen.
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
How often do you go?
Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.
He is.
Naw. Any good?
Suzanne Somers' tits.
All right.
What the fuck is this guy doing?
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
My brother's car!
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
Just be glad you're all right.
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
How's it going.
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
No way! He just called him a dick.
Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
What variables?
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
What's the big deal?
Well I never did it.
Was it great?
It was okay.
You'll always remember your first time.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
Climax together.
Does that ever happen?
How long does Doug take?
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
What do you think?
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
What do you think it is?
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
What do you want?
Where's Doug?
He's not coming.
Sometime?
Yeah, like maybe never.
But what are you going to do?
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
Mr. Spicoli?
Yes.
Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
I couldn't make it in time.
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
What can I get for you tonight.
Thanks. So do you.
Where do you feel like going?
I don't know. Wherever you want.
The point sounds fine.
Are you really nineteen?
What about those other guys you live with?
Thanks for coming to get me.
This is a nice car.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Do you know what you want?
Are you all right?
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
Do you want to come inside?
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
...I've got to go home.
What's April 16th?
It's John Bonham's birthday.
What about the notes?
Hi, Mark.
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
Two Cokes.
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Let's have lunch!
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
Naw! That's science fiction stuff!
Naked!?
Dobermans don't talk.
I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
Naw! Not a major.
Where ya comin' from, young man?
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
Oh, my God!...
We're your friends. We're not like the others.
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
Where's the medicine?
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs...
Why?
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
That's what gives me The Fear.
Not much. Why?
I have to go.
GO?
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
When does this thing stop?
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
How about a check?
I want that fucking radio!
You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately!
Plans?
Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
Like big lizards.
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
Lucy is looking for you.
Where'd you get this?
Some of what?
Right!
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.
Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.
The airport is over there!
May I see your license.
Could I have that, please?
Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
I will not die because of him!
Where are you two going?
IS IT CLEAR?!
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Well, it don't look pretty.
I don't think you should...
We shot a skunk.
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
Where's that?
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
Wha?
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
And the rest of 'em?
And that's how I ended up here.
They're right here.
You all sure about this?
Where's the tunnel?
We just smeared a skunk.
Scared?
Ohhh.
So, what now? Did those things leave?
Any more ideas Animal Planet?
You weren't helpin'.
We're better off.
Come on!
What now, Geronimo?
Your brother, huh?
Yep.
Your parents of relation?
I'm in.
We're going to get help.
We gotta try.
We gotta be close.
What's in the back?
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
How are you holding up?
What is this?
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
It's much safer in there, sweety.
Doesn't your foot hurt?
Um-hmmm.
You wanna see, baby?
Sure.
How much you got?
My husband...
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
He's dead.
He only shot you once.
In the kitchen, under the sink.
What?
What?
Is it gassed up?
Fully.
Open?
Covered.
How many?
Max?
Seven.
Nine?
Oh? And what's that?
Sit still, look less like a meal.
Welcome back.
They were all over the place.
Bullshit.
Clever fuckers.
Blow the goddamn hatch!
Got 'cha!
'Eh, Chief?
Fine, Chief.
Gimme the keys.
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
Move slow and move quiet.
Move it!
Shit!
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
SHIT.
COME ON!
Yeah, maybe.
HELP MEEE!
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
OH JESUS!
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
Yeah, I'll go.
Let's go.
DON'T!
Let's wait it out.
And the last one is the...
Hold it!
Go! Go!
Not without you!!!
Get to your cars!
Oh my God... What is that?
You know you don't have to do this.
I'm fine, I really am.
I admire your strength.
Her name is Charlie.
Did we make it?
Um, well...
Are you lying to me?
What did we say about lying?
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
Frances?  Oh no.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
What're you doing?
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
I guess so, sir.
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
No, I'm concerned with everything.
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
Hi Frances, got a minute?
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
I'm not!
You're afraid!
Good, good. Give them that.
Madam...?
Okay, but come here first.
Hello, Harold.
Frances.
Where's Clifford?
He's not here.
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
An actress.
A rich actress.
I know, but --
What does Clifford say?
Hey, where's the fire, sister?
Get your clothes on, lady --
GET OUT!
You learn your lines?
Sort of.
There've been some calls.
...Yes.
Without me.
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
Harry!
We're all square now, Harry. Right?
No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
We'll get you home, Frances.
Were you an alcoholic?
No.
Were you a drug addict?
Bye, baby.
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
I didn't have much to do with it.
You wrote it, didn't you?
It's already started, Dad... with me.
What do I do, Dad?
You really want to go?
And you think it's worth all this?
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
Please, Francie...
Are you... are you hungry?
Bread?
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
Good.
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
Oh, Kurt!
Age?
Fifteen.
You can always come see it in London.
Only if you were in it. Are you?
Why... yes.
Then don't go to Hollywood.
You sound as if you hate it.
Aren't you ever going back?
...Not if I can help it.
They'll mend.
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
Harry.
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
You think I'd miss it?
Well? What'd you think?
How'd I look?
Enh.
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
What?
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
Frances...
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
Oh no...
Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
Harry... I met someone.
Serious, huh?
Shit. I meant the other way around.
Well, the studio told me not to.
The hell you will, Harry York.
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
The chauffeur. He's watching.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
How the hell do you find me anyway?
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
Think I'll have a glass.
Nice joint. Can you afford it?
I took the early rounds.
No, Harry, I can't -- 
Take a walk, pal.
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
I should've known...
That's right.
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
You know something, Harry?
What's that?
To quarter-horses.
There's just one more thing.
What's that?
You give up on her?
Frances, You're crazy.
Anyway... if you need me...
Frances! Frances!
Who?
I love you, Harry. I love you.
Where to?
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
How did I look?
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
No.
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
That would be okay.
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
And no people.
Where you goin'?
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Yeah.
Shit!
...Is that not true?
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
Did you expect him to look you up?
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
Who're you?
But I want to. I'm trying!
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
How's it sound?
The speech? Real good.
I don't care.
It's okay.
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
It's your fan mail, little sister.
You kill me, Mama.
Well, who have we here...?
Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.
Where are you going?
How long will you be?
I'll have lunch ready by one.
I'll be back.
At one. Promise?
Say you promise.
Yes, Mama.
Don't... talk crazy.
Where are you going?
I'm going out!
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
Excuse me.
Don't I know you?
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
Thanks are hardly necessary.
It ain't for lack of trying.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
And what's that?
...Did you really say that?
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
This whole thing is a joke!
Is there something else?
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
No! No!
What?
Yes.
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
You drove him to his torment.
And he drove me to mine.
Nice.
Better that way... for me.
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
You're an outcast.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
Friends? Do they live around here?
Yes. Very close
People can be kinder than you think.
Come warm yourself if you like.
Kill me and have done with it.
Your crime... as well as mine.
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
What can I do?
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
Yes. I want this over and done with.
Why... her?
What is this?
A brain. Extremities.
This was not taken from a grave.
You will honor your promise to me!
She's beautiful.
GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
Poor William! What indignant tears!
Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
You dance so beautifully together.
Nothing. Still nothing.
So have I
Are you all right?
Have you seen Willie?
Don't cry, Elizabeth.
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
Smell the air. Wonderful.
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
Father's so proud.
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
I'll have to do better than that.
I've loved you all my life
This feels... incestuous.
I wish to be your husband.
I wish to be your wife.
You make me weak.
Your decision. For us.
I give you my soul...
Victor. I love you,
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
I thought I'd never see you again!
Why the change? What about your work?
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
Brother and sister no more.
It's going to ram us.
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
No. But someday.
Professor?
I was just clearing my throat.
I am not mad.
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
Can you think of a better reason?
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
Only you would think of that!
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
They just caught the man who did it.
They'll hang him all the same.
Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
You can't. Death is God's will!
I resent God's monopoly.
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
What happened up there?
Paracelsus?
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
What is your name?
Professor Waldman.
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
Are you a physician?
Creature? A... human like creature?
You know of it?
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
Do you share my madness?
Who are you?
The killer is still out there.
We should go now.
What'd you see?
Tomorrow is another day.
I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
Any particular reason?
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
You want to leave?
Next Friday.
You think you're gonna last all summer?
Oh, my God...
Filmmaker.
What'll you do when you leave here?
How the... did he get in there?
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
Good point.
Help you clean up?
I don't hear it anymore.
It sounded like Brenda.
Where?
I'll go check on Brenda.
Jack?
Marcie?
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
You said we were special.
You know what I said, though.
I wouldn't know.
Somebody'll see.
Let's go back, Barry...
What the hell?
Give me a hand?
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
You saved my life.
What is it?
Roll him over!
Chance to get even?
Jack?
How about our last jay?
Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
I love you.
What about Neddy?
I don't love Neddy.
Ned!
It's just a dream.
Are you wet?
Mmmmmmmph?
Mmmmmmmph.
Best over...
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
Cowboy.
Girls can't be cowboys.
You okay?
Anything else you want?
I got to.
How much do I owe you?
One night on the town.
That's thirty percent.
Good luck.
Another coincidence.
How many with you?
Just my son and I.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
So do I just follow you?
Yeah, follow us.
So let's do it.
Why do you want to stop?
What's this guy's problem?
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
You don't believe in suicide.
What's your name?
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
Not a chance.
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
Who's this?
My wife.
In heaven.
Yes, she is.
How'd she die?
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Is this real?
Real McCoy.
You're a preacher?
I was a minister.
Was? As in not anymore?
Yes.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Yes.
Didn't like it, did ya?
You won't let him touch her?
Who else?
Pass.
Why not, against your religion?
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
To your family.
Now, is your shit together?
In the Winnebago.
Did he...?
I promise.
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
What do you think Mom would say?
There's nothing wrong with this place.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
I promise.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
I'm going for 'em!
Where are you taking us?
What's in Mexico?
What you said to me in the room.
What did I say?
Yes.
Do you believe me?
Yes.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
Daddy's dead.
Watch my back!
How many bullets left, kid?
I'm sorry.
See ya.
-- you got your microwave --
-- you got your sink --
-- you got your shower --
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
What do you want from me? I did what you said.
Were you giving that pig signals?
He says you were scratching.
I wasn't scratching!
Whiskey!
You can't come in here.
This is a private club. You're not welcome.
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
What the fuck was that about?
Start the car.
You believe me don't cha?
Gotcha!
Do they have cable?
No.
All I'm saying --
Sight seein'.
What'd ya see?
Cops.
Where's the woman?
She's in the other room.
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
Is it me? Is it my fault?
Seth, if you were me --
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Richard!
This isn't gonna work.
What does that mean?
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
Keep your voice down.
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
Far out.  Where are my glasses?
They broke when you fell.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
That's what you think?
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
I'm lookin' scared?
That's what you look like.
You know what you look like?
No, Richie, what do I look like?
How?
Where are you right now?
What do you mean?
Where are you?
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
How are you?
Thank you, ensign.
Who's "we"?
I've been accused of that wish.
The woman I saw you with...
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
Administration, Ensign Blondell.
Don't say my name.
Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
Got it.
Wow...
Your prerogative, Senator.
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
Thank you, sir.
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
None at this time, sir.
No, sir.
Same rules for everyone, sir.
Straight up?
Then good night.
See me, sir?
Permission to leave, sir?
Fine by me, sir!
Newberry, get a photo.  South?
Entering my scan now...
Shit.  Think we're had.
Smoke her.
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
White House boys want a private meeting.
Yes?
So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
"Coronado."
Uh, question, ma'am.
You know him.
I'm sure it is.
Hey.  You okay, Flea?
I can make this wall without --
O'Neil?
Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
Unless you Whiskey Run.
That was good headwork, lieutenant.
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
So dump on me.
This has nothing to do with you.
Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
Jordan.  You watch your ass.
All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
"In Washington..."
I'd sure like to know who.
They're more afraid of you.
And how do you know that?
Hey.  Way to gut it out.
You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
He was married?
At first.
You got anybody, Wick?
That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
I can't go out.  Not like this.
Do you, uh, know...
What're you guys doing?  Huh?
She part of the training?
32 feet, six inches!
'Cool?
Say again, sir?
Chief, sir, I don't understand why --
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
"Dad."
Any brothers?  Sisters?
Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
Do you?
No.
Good to see you again, too, sir.
Say again?  How many micks?
Got it.
O'Neil...
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
Clear.
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
We're fucked.
Darth Vader reads poetry...
Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?
You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
This ain't workin' right!
Subject?
O'Neil, Jordan.
Thought you two were file-closed.
You knew about us?
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
That's cuz I'm married to you.
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
Who the hell are all these people?
Me!? You where the one...
Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
He stole my report! That's my report!
What are you doing?
Don't you think we have enough?
Think we can fit up in there?
He's not going to do it.
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
I'll take them all.
So you made it.
Most people don't.
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
I got pretty close.
...he's pregnant.
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
How do you know?
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
You'd be surprised.
Who was that French guy, anyway.
I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
Did Romeo have a name?
What the hell are you doing?
What's it to you?
What do I get?
Five bucks.
Did you talk with Humphries?
This is not the place...
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
Mr. Caiman, you're married.
And you're beautiful...
Mr. Caiman...
I can't.
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
Oh, I'm not married.
Really? A girlfriend then?
Not for a long time, now.
Well, I think you're cute.
I'm sorry about all this.
Merde!
They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
We've secured the doors on both levels.
Where's Luc and Pierre?
Have them sealed off.
You're fast.
Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
What sample?
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
Are you looking for this?
Do I know you?
We've met before.
It's the French Secret Service.
Why are you telling this to me?
I need you to trust me.
Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
What's with the chewing gum?
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
Who the hell are you?
Hello?
It's Raymond.
Well good, that's very... nice.
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
This is it?
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
You WILL go out there.
I won't and nothing you say-
"The show must go on."
God, what an ass.
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
Go ahead!
What?  What?
Nothing.
Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
~hex!  Alex, are you oKav?
Not again...
Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
What's happened?
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
Alex you can't -just leave.
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
Why didn't you stop at the market?
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
You could order something in.
A boy comes to the door.
Oh my god, It's real.
We heard it the first time!
May I get the check?
"Go into the cloud! ...
Alex? Where are you going?
I don't know.
You said "the Commander.
No I didn't.
He always has to make the big entrance.
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
What's  your name, son?
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
Yes Commander?
What does the Omega 13 do?
Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
Okay, now. But-
No, wait, are you-
Lt. Madison, GO.
Shit! Go!
Up.
I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
Structural damage at 68 percent.
What's the weather like outside?
The ship is sustaining structural damage.
The enemy is matching velocity.
Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
Systems register functional.
U.... What do you think?
A hologram...
Never mind, Fred....
As good as Hopkins?
"Crewman #6"... Call me Guy.
THAT'S why you built this ship?
Where are the miners?
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
Your last name.
Yeah, what is it?
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
More to the left... Stay parallel...
"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.
They're gone.
Not a clue. You?
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
What?
It's Jason...
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...
Only answers to me.
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
Can it be repaired?
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
How does the rolling help, actually?
Clenched jaw...
Jason.. Can you hear me?
What?  What did he say?
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
He's accelerating to Mark 6.
Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!
You're kidding. When for?
You gotta admit, they do love him.
That's it, It's go time.
That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
Stop, please! I don't know!
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
We pretend...
Simpler.
We.. We lie.
I... certainly, but-
Commander?... Where are you... going?
Home.
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
An interstellar vox.
How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
Weapons storage...
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
NO, Thank God he has not.
Then how did he find out about the device?
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
"Deception..." "Lies."
But there it is!...
A model, only as big as this.
Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!
Could be this.
Do your best, Tommy...
What kind of signal?
Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
Oh, right, sorry.
Sorry Guys... It just went off.
Okay... On what?
How about the pig-lizard?
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
It doesn't have eyes.
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Let's do it, Tommy.
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Continue forward, sir?
WHAT? WH
Because they're coming right at us.
Some say that Hessians are invincible.
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
Over three hundred miles.
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
Go on... I want to hear everything.
Is that a fact.
The army needs you.
Well, George, who were you?
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
You, you just need a new flint, General.
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
What?  What are you talking about?
Me?  You apologizing to me?
Wil...
Yes, my lord.
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
Who is that!?
How old are you, Captain?
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
Are you going to keep him, sir?
Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.
Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all.  Quite the character.  He's got a tremendous reputation.
Makes you gag.
Gag on your own invention, then.
Oh, come now...
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
General Lee is detained captain...
Detained by what?
Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!
Unofficially, General Greene.
My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold?  He's up there.
Colonel Reed...
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
I... they look both the same.
I only meant...
These supplies...?
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!
General Lee, sir!
It's another demonstration against the king.  This is the wildest yet.
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
Martha!  For God's sake!
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
I want you to see our hospital.
Colonel Washington?  Colonel Nathanael Greene, Rhode Island Militia.
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
General Greene?
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
Well, this must be about something!
You know very well who it is that I love.
George, you know I only love you, but...
You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.
Where... do those men come from, George?
Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?
What are you doing?
Let's get you darker!
That's good... who?
All people have rights!
Just because they are born?
Yes!
Who says so?
I say!
The land here is best for grain and corn.
Juba was a Numidian.
William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff.
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
I reserved a Cadillac.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.
So where's the money?
I guess still in the locker.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
You get the money?
No. What's this?
Trade for what?
You get life for kidnapping.
I have to ask you for that key.
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
I think I pulled my quadriceps.
About sixty.
Where is my nephew?
Your who?
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
What's this movie you're doing first?
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
There's Ilona.
What about her?
Get something going there.
I really think I can be of service on this one.
I need the money.
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
I don't believe this.
Karen? You okay?
You know Laurel Canyon?
Where's Karen?
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
I can't do it.
I'm working on a few things.
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
C-18.
I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
What I been wondering is where's he been.
Ray Barboni?
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Okay. So who are you?
What?
Look at me, Ray.
You say look at you?
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
Yeah? Which terminal?
Who the fuck are you?
He owes me money.
Get in line, bro.
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
You live in Miami?
That's right.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
I'm in the movie business.
You're an investor, is that it?
I'm a producer.
You have a card in here?
Have we met? I don't recall.
That's what I'm doing.
Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
A marker's like a check, Harry.
You're not looking at me, Harry.
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
I'm not the guy, Harry.
You pack a gun?
Not really.
What does that mean?
Maybe a few times I have.
Ever shot anybody.
Once.
What's it called?
"Mr. Lovejoy".
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
You don't even know these guys.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
What do you get out of this?
I had to tell 'em something.
Here's your keys, Harry.
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
Yeah, he told me.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
So you want to know.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
I'm thinking of a movie.
One we're producing.
What happened? The pressure got to you?
Martin, look at me.
Wait. How about this?
How about this?
At that point, basically, that has to be it.
What's that?
I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
You've been losing.
I'm up twelve grand today.
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
How'd you know I was here?
How? By taking my money?
It's all mine.
You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
The door from the patio, in back.
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
You been here the whole time?
I got you a copy of the script.
Then you've read it?
I want to know.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
Harry... My God...
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
Are you going down?
I don't know.
Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
Were you scared up there?
I'll be right back.
What took you so long?
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
I told you not to -
He already knew it.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Whatta you doing out there?
I'm going into the movie business.
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
Pick 'n' Save.
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
You seem to feel fine about it.
Be quiet and listen.
I don't have a dog.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
Harry -
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
Harry, we spoke with Martin.
'We?'
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
Lufkin. His... agent.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
A passenger liner. Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem.
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
You think the extra strain caused it?
How about now?
What? You sure?
That's what it says.
Damn mind of it's own.
What day is it?
I don't know. Tuesday?
You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
One more?
What is your first name?
Maureen.
What?
Maureen.
Roger.
Roger?
You think that's funny
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
This's gonna hurt a little.
Guess I'll just keep working.
What're you crazy?
Maybe that is his boat.
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
Smokes?
Try Wednesday.
Did you?
Dodge.  Dodge.
Get up.
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
If you get it back in one piece.
Mother fucker!
What is it?
What's this?
I thought you said it was just a blade.
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
How much longer's that gonna take?
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
The right way and the wrong way.
But how long?
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
How long?
Three, four days.
Went aboard.
It's a hell of a lot of money.
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
Sounds like the hull.
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
Damn barbaric is what it is.
That'd be my guess.
Dodge to Murphy.
On a passenger ship in 1953?
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
I don't know what you're talking about?
I think you know.
The radio!
You smashed it!
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
You're late.
Sorry.
What's slow?
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Could be a fishing boat.
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
That's what I call a payday.
Stay away. Or else.
No.
Lights?
Sudden flashes of light.
What?
Candy?
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
Coffee?
She was sailing up north, right?
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
Take it easy, you'll live longer.
Did you see him?
There's somebody else on this boat.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
No cowboy shit up there, understand?
Got your light?
Murphy to Epps.
Epps.
You just shoot at something?
How's he doing?
Same. Any luck?
The ah... the radio's out.
Smashed it up pretty bad.
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
It's not gonna hold us.
Hey.
Hey.
Couldn't sleep.
What do you think happened on this boat?
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
Showing you what?
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
Victims of what?
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
What's that supposed to mean?
Murphy to Epps.
Epps, over.
Epps? You there?
Over the gold.
What happened?
We hit land.
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
I think I see it pretty well.
Let the buyer beware.
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
I must be in the wrong business.
You got that right.
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
Too deep to anchor out there.
It's funny.
Murphy, goddamit.
Morning.
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
I heard that.
We could call for help.
Greer?
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
Never been more thirsty in my life.
How're you feeling?
What happened?
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
We're not gonna be able to pump it!
It's a Noaa buoy.
We're still drifting.
Can't find the shotgun.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
What about the gold?
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
As I said, what seems to be the trouble?
Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.
Better late than never.
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
That cost me twenty grand at least.
Have you seen my blue spatula?
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Will you get off my back for once?
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Who?
Guess.
Someone from the past.
Who?
Give up?
YES.
Maxine.
Yup.
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
What is it now?
Pumpkin? What's wrong?
Pumpkin, are you in there?
Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...
Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here?
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
Who is this, Enid?
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
Did you actually do this painting?
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
...wow...
Well, yes...
Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.
Huh?
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
What the hell is wrong with you?!
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.
Jesus, look at this guy.
Hi Josh.
I just stopped in to say hi.
Hi... what's up?
Why?
Then why do you hate me so much?
That's just the way I am!
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
Hi Enid.
God, what a bunch of retards...
Shut up!
Uh oh... don't turn around...
What? Why?
Since when is she an "actress"?
Why?
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
Much later.
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
Okay, okay!
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
Hi, Al!
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
Does Oomie really like this show?
Hey - why do you have this?
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
Look at how cute I am!
Look, that's back when I hated you.
I remember every minute of that party.
Which loser?
You know, the green cardigan guy.
Why do I always have to do it?
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
Look, maybe that's him!
I want to "make love" to him.
SHUT UP!
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
It's obviously him!
What's going on now? What's he doing?
Are you sure?
He's insane!
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
Ew, look at this...
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
Not really...
"Funky"?
Where are we going?
Let's go hassle Josh.
There he is...
JOSH!
I'll bet he never jerks off...
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Why are we going here? I hate this place.
I didn't get it either.
Ew ... when did you get that?
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
What? Where?!
It's a surprise.
I totally, totally hate you.
Give me all your money, bitch!
Where did you get that?
You won't believe it! Guess!
Where?
Anthony's II!
No way... when?
Just now... I went with Seymour.
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
You're gross.  See that guy?
Which one?
He gives me a total boner!
...maybe we should be lesbos...
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
Go ahead...
No, really...
Don't you want nice stuff?
Do you still want to do something tonight?
What happened to Seymour?
How repulsive!
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
What are you talking about? Who?
Just some people from work...
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
What? When did you see Josh?!
He came into work.
Why? What did he say?
Nothing.
You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
It's fine.
There.
What time?
Do you want anything?
Wow... finally.
What about me? Am I not even here?
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...
Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?
Well, we won't keep you.
Seymour does.
You still interested in that?
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.
Tell me what?
Punk rock is over!
Oh, how "punk."
Go die, asshole!
Hi... what's your name?
You're late, asshole.
Fine, and how are you?
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
Hey, where are you going?
That's five hundred dollars.
What?
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s?
How much is it?
A dollar seventy-five.
Yeah, sure, I guess...
Oops! I dropped it!
I don't think so...
PLEASE? We have to!
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Shh!
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
You work at Cook's Chicken?
What are you, a fry cook or something?
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
Hey, can I borrow this?
You can open your eyes now.
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
Really?
Wow!  What was that all about?
Uh... hello?
Hi, it's me...
Oh, hi...
Boo!
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
I... I don't think so.
Does that mean you don't like me?
No, of course not.
So, do you like me, Seymour?
In what way do you mean?
What are you doing here?
I had to see you.
Can you at least let me in?
What's the matter?
You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
So where would we go?
What do you want?
What do you want?
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
I will if you want to.
They're Seymour's.
Well, here's where the fun never stops!
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
I agree.
Yeah.
I am.
What do we have here, Margaret?
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
Why would she be hiding from me?
I don't know... where is she, then?
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
I don't know.
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
What do you mean?
On that pathetic fake blind date.
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
Seymour?
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
Let me see the sick.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
Morning, friend, glorious day.
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
I am a man of peace.
Starting now, we attack them.
You've never built in Africa.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
Don't they, though?
Yes he is.
Understand, I had help-
You're certain about tomorrow?  But you don't seem excited. 
You don't enjoy killing, do you? 
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
Very good indeed.
I don't suppose I could watch.
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
John, it will not be easy.
But you said they were always old.
What a good week.
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
What did I do?
Got me out of trouble.
I can try.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
...misfire... it jammed...
Has it ever done that before?
Think about something else.
Have you ever failed?
What happened to them?
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.
You think they'll come then?  Why?
Good luck.
How many do you think they've killed?
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.
It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.
Did it look like this in your mind?
I am also liaison between these two.
Oh yes, I think so. 
For you.
Thank you, Samuel.
I expect so- it's from my wife.
Do you love her?
I do, actually; very much.
You like him, don't you?
Oh yes. But it takes time.
You've known him long?
He has children?
Where is it?
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
How many cattle?
Four should do it.
Did you ever see a lion that size?
Where do you go next?
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
Oh no.
Do you ever see him?
Occasionally
Does he ever mention me?
I won't.
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
No, you didn't, Frank.
Okay, that's no problem.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
His name is Oscar.
I'll do it.
That's where the buggy stopped.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
Good luck.
So this is what you do, huh?
Oh, hello, Peter.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
That's not true.  It was 1620.
Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming.
I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
I don't think we should leave her alone.
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
Yes, the scourge --
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
-- the sorrow --
I command you.
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
You've got to do something!
These boys aren't playing around.
Can I have some of your water?
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.
Yes, I did.  We were city champs.
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
Egon!
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
I'd like to have a stool specimen
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
That's a thousand million electron volts.
You were supposed to help me with this.
Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
From where -- Neptune?
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
Nothing.  Not a trace.
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
I'm Egon --
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
Is the line sinking?
Rivers of the stuff!
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
Oh, hiya, Pete.
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
Who?
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Who?  Who?  Who?
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
I'm Ray --
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
And now you're going to eat it?
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
My Fault!
I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
Ready?
I'm ready.
Now that's one ugly dude.
Huh?  What?
You finished here?
No, I just thought --
Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
And pure --
Aren't you glad we waited?
Roy?  Your clock broke.
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
Now where are you going?
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Uuuuuuugh!!
Ready?  What is it?
No.  They're just coming to me.
Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Oh, Dana, it's you ...
... I thought it was the drug store.
Oh, Dana, it's you.
Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
Are you the Gatekeeper?
We're all professionals here, Miss ...
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
Is that your professional opinion?
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
That's a violin concerto.
You really don't act like a scientist.
No?  What do I act like?
Like a used car salesman.
That's too bad.
What?
Uh-huh.
Well, let's check it out.
You're quite a housekeeper.
I told you, I ...
Damn!
Are you all right?
There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
All right.  What do you want to do?
That's it.  Get out.
On a purely scientific basis.
Out!
I'll scream.
Don't scream.
All right.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
Great rehearsal.
You heard it?
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
What's that got to do with it?
Did you see it?  What was it?
Oh, that's very - unusual.
I think it's the food of the future.
Die in what sense?
I want you to have this. 
I don't believe in luck.
Are you Peter Venkman?
Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
Yes, it would.
And may I see this storage facility?
No, you may not.
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
Because you didn't say the magic word.
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
May I please see the storage facility?
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
All right.  What is it?
A square?
Nervous?
Two wavy lines?
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
Were you recently in the bathroom?
Oh!  You're here.
I'm always serious.
What?
Why not?
Trust me.  It will be bad.
It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
Where's the Keymaster?
Who?
Gozer.
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
Life is just a state of mind.
Sorry, Buddy!
Set entry grid.
What do you mean by "seen?"
I told you it's real.
What do we do now?
I don't know.  Talk to it.
What do I say?
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
But most people are afraid to even report these things.
Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?
How was your date?
So do I.
Ray -- Something's here.
Where are you, Pete?
Third floor.  Get down here,
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
How do you know?
It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.
Agile bastard, isn't he?
I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
What?  What popped in there?
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Me, too.
Do you believe in God?
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
And the seas would boil ...
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
Judgement Day ...
Stantz?  You okay in there?
What's he talking about?  Choose what?
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
More wine, sister?  Surely you can drink more than that.
If I may be so bold...
For the gods, spit it out!
Tribuus... tomorrow.
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
What are you talking about?
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
I am their hero!
Not yet, dear brother...
That's difficult to say, general.
I back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you, I'm not a politician...
They won't break this one.
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
I'm serious.
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
Marcus Aurelius has died.
Where is my father?
Yes, Caesar?
I've read of it.
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
Why you?
Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed?
No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
You cannot die.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
He killed his father and then my family...
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
The Senators admire you.
Tomorrow?
As soon as I can.
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
My troops don't make policy.
You brought the army into Rome.
He's very realistic.
Greeks?
What about their philosophy lessons?
They're studying with Cynics.
You need to come home!
Let him trust Quintus.
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
Take your hands off me animal!
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
You get to come alive again in the country!
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
How much money is involved?
Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
I want nothing to do with the arena.
Hello.
Do you want some dinner?
Aren't you eating?
No.
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
No -- why should I?
Could you do it?
Will you take me home now?
I'm sorry I took you in there.
Where is the car?
I want to go home.
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
No, I couldn't.
But could you try?
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
We won't. Let's go inside.
Wait a minute.
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Do you?
Was she married or something?
Yes.
No.
And it's all over now.
Yes.
I do.
You do?
Benjamin -- what's happening?
Why aren't you ready?
What is it?
That woman --
What?
That woman. The older woman.
Elaine --
No -- don't cry --
GET OUT!
Don't cry. 
I'm meeting someone.
Where are you meeting this person?
Is that him over there?
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
Here? In Berkeley?
Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
-- really incredible --
Here he comes.
Because -- I am.
What do you think?
I said I think it is.
All right then! Yes!
Well, I want you to leave.
Elaine -- I love you.
I don't understand --
Why?
Because it isn't true.
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
What are you looking for?
My belt.
What are you going to do now?
Are you going home?
No.
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
But Elaine --
Benjamin?
I don't know.
But you might.
Yes.
When?
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
I don't see how we can.
We just can.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
I'll think about it.
You really will?
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
I just don't think it would work.
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
Oh no. He said that.
Are we getting married tomorrow?
No.
The day after tomorrow?
Benjamin?
657-2036
Hello -- who is this?
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Thank you.
Ben!
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
Ben.
Yes, sir.
Are you listening?
Yes I am.
Yes, I will.
You a student?
What's that?
I said -- not exactly -- no.
What are you then?
What?
One of those outside agitators.
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
Mr. McCleery?
You heard me. Out of here.
What for?
I am going to call the police now.
BENJAMIN?
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
Mrs. Robinson?
I'm in the bathroom.
Well here's the purse.
Could you bring it up?
I'm putting it here by the door.
Will you bring it in to me?
Where are you?
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
Can I help you, sir!
What?
The Singleman party, sir?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
It's in the main ballroom.
A room. I'd like a room, please.
A single room or a double room?
A single. Just for myself, please.
Is anything wrong, sir?
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Where is it?
What?
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
Is it a girl?
Is what a girl?
Whatever it is you're upset about.
In general.
What?
Will you take me home?
You don't?
No. 
Thank you.
Will you come in, please?
All right then.
Please wait till my husband gets home.
When is he coming back?
Drink?
What do you think of me?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
What?
Did you know that?
Look -- I think I should be going --
No.
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
Like what?
What do you think?
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
What is wrong with me?
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
Her portrait?
Yes.
Benjamin?
Yes?
I think I'll go to bed.
Oh. Well, goodnight.
Won't you unzip my dress?
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
I know that. But I'm --
Thank you.
What are you so scared of?
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
What if he did?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
But they would! Don't you see?
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
Where is it?
Don't be nervous.
I want to say something first.
Let me out!
Do you understand what I said?
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
Yes, I do.
Benjamin?
Hello, Benjamin.
How are you?
May I have a drink?
He didn't see me.
Have you gotten us a room yet?
I haven't. No.
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Now?
Well -- I don't know.
Well -- do you want to go up first?
Yes -- I think that would be good.
I'll be up in five minutes.
Well -- goodbye then --
Benjamin.
To tell you?
The number.
Well.
Benjamin.
Why don't you watch?
What?
Oh -- yes. Wood?
Wood or wire? They have both.
Either one will be fine.
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
You what?
This is all terribly wrong.
Benjamin, is this your first time?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
Are you kidding?
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
On your first time --
Who said it was my first time?
That you're afraid --
Well what do you want to talk about?
Oh my God.
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Oh.
Neither.
You're not interested in art?
Can I take off my clothes now?
Do you really want me to?
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
What one.
What?
What novel did you read.
There!
I walk out.
What do you say to him?
He's asleep.
We're talking.
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
Calm down, Benjamin.
Now let's keep going here.
Right.
About five years.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
How many times a year.
Man, is this interesting.
Not exactly.
But you don't hate him.
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
No.
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
Why did you do that?
See if you can guess.
Well I can't.
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Yes.
At college.
Yes.
What was your major?
Art.
Kind of.
Well how did it happen?
I'm curious.
We'd go to his car.
Oh no. In the car you did it?
Oh my God.
Really. I want to know.
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
Don't talk about Elaine.
Don't talk about Elaine?
No.
Why not?
I wish you'd tell me.
Good.
I was just kidding around.
Good.
But why shouldn't I?
I have my reasons.
Then let's hear them.
I wouldn't know.
Well, I'm not.
Are you?
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
Now don't start this.
What?
Did I say that?
You wouldn't.
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
If that's how you feel --
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
May I stay then?
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Then give me your word you won't.
This is absurd.
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
Mrs. Robinson --
I don't believe you.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
I'll find her.
I say I've got it.
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Very good, sir.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
Braddock -- Braddock?
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
I drive around.
What else?
Why did you say that?
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
Not if you don't want to.
Goodnight, Benjamin.
You believe me, don't you?
No.
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
They don't know?
No -- they don't.
-- worried?
Well --
About what?
I guess -- about my future.
To be what?
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
Say that again.
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
No. She doesn't know about it.
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
Oh no.
What?
Thank you very much, sir.
Ben -- how old are you now?
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
Sir?
You'll never be young again.
Quite a while.
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
I will.
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
But why?
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
You miss the point.
Hello.
Mrs. Robinson?
Yes?
It's Benjamin.
Yes?
Benjamin Braddock.
Benjamin -- where are you?
Can you see me now?
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
The Carlsons' are here.
They came all the way from Tarzana.
Not now.
And what are you going to do?
No --
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
No -- no -- no -- no...
I don't like your tone.
With the pearls?
I've quit.
What about the money?
I'll pay you back.
Like dancing?
Never?
You're a fool!
He must be very nice.
Who?
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Have you seen it?
That.
You?
Oh -- work!!
Oh!
Reducing?
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Very little.
Aren't you?
What?
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
You're very funny --
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Of course.
We'll dance.
I'd given you up.
Chasing around.
Chasing what?
You were very different yesterday.
That was lovely.
Will you do me a big favor?
I'll do anything for you.
Would you like to make a man happy?
Yes -- I'd love to.
Why?
I feel sorry for him.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
Going?
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
You live here?
Oh!
Yes -- oh!
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
What do you want here?
Why do you hide in my room?
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Why do you look at me like that?
And -- and --
How tired you are!
Yes -- tired...
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
Strange man...
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
What can you see?
You are beautiful!
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
There.
I don't want them now.
I know.
Do you understand?
Grusinskaya --
You do believe that I really love you?
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
I'll go -- good-bye.
Shall I see you again?
Suzette will be back here any minute.
Very early in the morning.
Oh -- yes but -- later.
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
I can't.
Why do you think --
I'm worried about you.
Don't.
Till then.
Thank you, sir.
Not at all, sir. 
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
The Baron is tired?
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
If I could get into a game I might win some.
If we could scare up some men to play.
Ready, Kringelein?
Is that too much, Baron?
No -- not at all.
All right then.
That was my last.
You've lost everything?
I've no luck.
I take five hundred.
You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
Well -- last night was not so good.
I thought she was splendid!
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
I think it would be much better if you went away.
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
Hello! Hello! --
Is that for me?
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
For me?
No -- letters to two-eighty.
The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
Good heavens. What for?
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
Any letters?
No, Doctor.
Telegrams?
Anyone asked for me?
Any letters?
Send his bags up to my room.
Oh -- but -- I --
You're tired. I can see that.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun.  Oh, the pain.
There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably. 
Oh, I've got to find it.
You've nothing to fear, Kringelein
Oh, don't go.
I'm engaged for the evening.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
No - absinthe.
You like music?
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
A man might what?
Dance then? 
Yes.
You're trembling.
I never danced before -- in public.
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
I didn't like Preysing right off.
Money!
Yes, of course, -- money!
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
What...! --
I'm the stenographer.
Moreover --
Moreover...
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
No -- only occasional jobs. 
Tired?
You pay me.
You're a very unusual stenographer --
Moreover...
What is this?
You...
You...
Moreover...
What?
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
That's from skiing.
Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
Not too quickly.
What?
You're a little too fast.
Can't you understand me?
I understand you perfectly.
Have you got it now?
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
How nice -- your daughters?
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Definitely off.
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
Miss Flaemm.
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.
Tomorrow morning.
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
Well -- you want me?
Yes.
Of course -- of course. 
Oh, yes.
Insolent young cub!
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Baron!
You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.
You're sweet.
Come here. 
Oh, no.
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
What we want to know about is Manchester.
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
No water -- What a place!
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
I know you did -- I said you did --
Sorry, Preysing. 
You've decided against the merger?
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here.
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
Shall I tell them again?
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
You see -- what we are interested in --
I can't dance tonight --
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
Let us cancel the engagement.
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
Oh, come, Madam -- please come. 
Good morning, Suzette.
Madam has slept well?
Oh, yes, Suzette.
Madam will dress now, it is late.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
I'm cancelling the engagement.
Why not?
Take them back, Suzette.
Hurry, Suzette.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
It is time for the performance.
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
What -- what is it? Last night...
Last night?... There was no applause.
Good morning, Pimenov.
Gru -- you are positively radiant.
Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.
Again?
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
You're discharged.
Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
-- We must do something...
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
Have I kept you waiting?
No. No word.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
What's bluff?
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
Bobo, no, I --
My son --
Your what?
My son was in the hospital --
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
You ever hear about the oranges?
You mean, the insurance frammis?
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
Want a look?
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon!
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
All right.
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
Whadaya say?
Well, uh... No.
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
Oh, come on, Roy.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
They twisted my arm.
Thanks, uh, Lilly.
I guess I owe you my life.
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
I tripped over a chair.
Get off the grift, Roy.
Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
Roy, I don't want money from you.
I pay my debts.
Expecting visitors?
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
Going somewhere?
I just came back from Phoenix.
I've really got to --
Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
As though you do what I say.
You must have some money.
Just a few bucks.
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
You want a drink?
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
I know what's bugging you, of course.
You're getting off the grift?
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
This time...
I didn't teach you that.
Scram. Go home.
I can't. I just left home.
You're too young. You should be in school.
Where's the five?
Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
Mm?
Look at me.
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
Roy? It this all we have?
All? It ain't bad.
What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?
You called the doctor, huh?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
Get well soon.
Every day in every way.
Big spender.
No.
Working the what?
I'm a salesman.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
The long end. Big con.
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
What happened to Cole?
He retired.
Where?
Upstate where?
Think about it. Okay?
Open your door.
What?  What for?
You were gone for a while.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
I saw her.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
But the setup's there. It's there now.
Don't I get any say in this?
No! Because I --
That's what I say.
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
What is it? What's going on?
I'm happy the way I am.
I realize this is a shock.
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
Not that it matters.  This is the morgue?
You up to it now?
Yes, I know, I know.
Oh, Jesus.
No question, huh?
That's that, then.
Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
Well, thank you. And thank them.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
One set of muddy shoe prints.
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
You take all your dates here. Blake?
Only the real stiffs.
I can be real stiff.
That's it?
Yes.
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.
I'll be damned.
Mind if we sit down?
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Detective...
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
A dead body?
It's Amy Kramer.
Besides, it's historically inaccurate.
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
Another historical inaccuracy.
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
No shit?!
Jimmy, what are you doing?
Checking out your place.
What the --
You're twisted.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
Oh, so now it's my fault?
You some kind of fugitive or something?
No.
Why didn't you tell me?
Where are you going?
He found you, didn't he?
Get on the bus.
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Just get on the bus.
What?  Where is she?
Oh, God... no... not Molly.
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Where'd you get it?
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
You stole it?
Not me.
Why not?
What are you doing here?!
I can see that.  Why?
Can I come in?
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
Then you come out here.
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
I'm okay.
Better?
Linda!  He killed Linda!
Who?!
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
Looks great.  It does.
You okay?  You seem a little off.
It's John, isn't it?
It's always John.
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
This kid just wants his freedom.
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?
Hey, you alright?
What?
What are you looking at?
Who?
Michael Meyers.
The serial killer?
No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  It's the truth.
I can't believe this is happening.
We've got to get these kids out of here...
Look, they're staring right at us.
Wait.
What is it?
Can't you hold it?
You aced it, didn't you?
Better her than me.
Shane's going as a condom.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
Shit, Linda!
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Thanks!
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
Let the party begin.
Have enough fun for the both of us.
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
Mom -- Who is this?
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
Is Tim there?
Whatever happened to women in back?
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
What if your parents come home?
Aren't you gonna answer that?
Answer what?
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
You've been watching too much TV.
He says things.  Bad things.
No, Mom -- keep it on!
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
Promise?
Mommy!!!
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
Who are you?
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
My, God!  What have you done to him?
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
God, what's wrong with him?
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
Where's the baby?!
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
What now?!
Come on!
It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
There you are.  Who was that boy?
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
It was you.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
No!!!
Stay away, Sam.
Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
Miss me, baby?
I dunno, boy.
It's a bitch.
A bitch.
Didn't recognize you.
I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
Home is important to a man.
I suppose.
Home.
You know what gets me?
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
At least we found the diamonds.
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
You know what gets me?
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
What'll you do for transportation?
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
Go home.
So long, Colonel.
You know what gets me?
Let's talk about it some other time.
How short the skirts are.
I've been looking at motorcycles.
Go home!
And how were things?
Otherwise, how are things?
Could have happened to anybody.
First Nagasaki--now this.
I dunno, boy.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
What's funny about that?
How do you know that?
You told me.
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
I didn't know we had any women left.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
You never played a violin.
Me?
Okay.  Okay.
You're an imbecile.
I know you think that.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
Hello.
How are you, honeybunch?
Is Penelope in?
The posies are for her?
I wanted to apologize.
You've come to the right man.
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
I forget mine for years on end.
Insurance!
What an awful sound!
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
You're making a joke.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
We got to get another pilot.
For what?
To make an ass of yourself.
I wouldn't drop my gun.
You're hollow, like a woman.
You're my buddy.
Anybody home?
As a matter of fact--
Hello.
Hello.
You were about to ask a question?
Are you--do you--
Do you know who Wanda June is?
Life has denied me that thrill.
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
Man and boy.
Everybody says he was so brave.
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
She met him at college.
Excellent!
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
England?
Oh hell.
I don't know.
Mhravitch.  Remember that name.
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Why don't you go to bed--son.
A hundred dollars!
The smallest thing I've got.
Can I get dressed first?
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
Dad?
Mom?
What's this?
Nothing.
That's a rifle you have?
No.
Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?
I'm talking to you gently now.
"Hamburger Heaven."
Can I help you, sir?
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
Eighteen--  and a half.
I'm engaged.
Daughter--I love you very much.
You don't even know me.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
What's the matter?
Give us time.
Disease?
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
Bluh.
What's that all about?
We thought a doctor might help.
Your old beau?
We thought it was an emergency.
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
We all are.
Shouldn't you lie down?
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
Nothing would please me more.
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Say hello to your mother.
Now that's what I call fun.
He hasn't had breakfast yet.
Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
It's so--so stark.
You used to like it stark!
Now--turn around, if you would.
I have some change!
Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
They don't have to feel like slaves.
No.
The doctor.
And what is his most cherished possession?
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
Yes.
And no one's there now?
No you're not!
I came for my clothes.
I came for Paul as well.
If he wants to go.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
Well--what have we here?  A family.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
You're begging him to kill you?
Honor, I suppose.
No.
I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
Help your mother find the bullet.
How do I load?
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
Ooops.
Gentlemen--that's nice.
It's always locked.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.
Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
Ahh--then she's still alive.
She's fine.  Please--
Will you please go?  An emergency!
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
Are--are you crying, Penelope?
Ah!  You're ambulatory!
I was going to ask.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
I thought she was a widow.
It died for your sins.
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
There's a certain amount of information there.
This is man to man.
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
Oooooo.  That hurt.
You're old--so old.
Hands and knees, you say?
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
I'm an honorable clown?
King Arthur.
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
Cut me open.  Find out.
I've struck my blow.
Don Quixote.
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
Here.  Finish the job.
More clowning!  Don't you see?
Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
If you want to be found that way.
Don't shoot.
No.  No.
Can't do it.
Thank you--for my life.
It's trash now, like mine.
What are you going to do?
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
I dunno, boy.
You don't know?
It was a bitch.
And you went home unannounced, too?
Alice got married again.
She did?
You didn't even find that out?
There was so much going on.
Dead!
Jesus.
So long, you guys.
Thought you were another wife, maybe.
Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?
I heard you were looking for me.
Because he was cruel?
I don't care what she wears.
Something's made you sore.
You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
What's this?
Thank God!
That goes double for me.
And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared.
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
I know.
Stay home tonight!
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
Thank you, kind sir.
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
That's an interesting piece of news.
Not true.
How did she lose her feet?
In a railroad accident many years ago.
I didn't know that.
A lot of people don't.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
I hate that thing.
Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?
Yes, he is.
Is Norbert still here?
No.
Then who flushed the toilet?
What's his name?
Mom?
That man is your father.
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
I don't get it.
That's why I'm crying.
What does he say to do?
Yeah.
Then get him.
Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
You're taking Mom out tonight?
Don't worry about it.
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
I hate that thing.
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
He isn't any friend of Father.
He is my father.
He'd assume we had.
Yes?
Did you see him?
Yeah.
Is he all right?
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
How long has this been going on?
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
I'm sorry.
You're saying no.
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
Take plenty of cigars.
That's the XKE.
They didn't murder me.
It's a jungle out there.
You know each other?
We met here earlier this evening.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Get out of here.
Do it!
Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
Not true.
Kid--kid--
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
You're not exactly the type we're looking for.
You mean I'm black?
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
Do you want to take a session?
I just want to ask some questions.
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
You're still dressed?
Well, I want to...
Are you going to stiff me?
Now, what do you want?
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
How many weeks?
Hello. You want some information?
Yeah.
We offer...
Yeah, yeah...
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
I don't know no Tod.
That's all you got, three girls?
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
No, that would be much too overpowering.
Are you sure it's all right?
Yes. I think it'll look better.
Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?
Are you the star of this picture?
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
The other girl is the star?
She thinks so.  What do you do?
Yeah.
You making a feature?
Joanne?
You know her?
No. I saw her with Tod.
Where is she?
Tod might know.
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
You're not a film producer, are you?
Are you a private detective?
Something like that. How much do you make?
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
Up front?
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
No.
You don't drink?
A friend.
Of Joanne's?
And your wife? Where's she?
At least I'm a growing person.
What rate?
Say what?
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
Neither am I.
But it's all you do.
What do you care about?
What's T-J?
They were here?
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
What does that mean?  What does he do?
He deals in pain.
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
I can stop if you want.
You really believe all that?
Yeah.  Well, mostly.
It's not quite the same thing.
Rot in hell, honey.  He's busy now.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
What makes you so sure?
Why do you say that?
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
What happened?
Where is he?
But then you'll forget about me.
Well, what do they know?
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
So then, Mr. Mast...
Who's paying you?
You are.
Hello?
Mr. Van Dorn?
Mast?
Where are you? The connection sounds very good.
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
I've got a meeting...
What are you paying me for?
Where is she?
I don't know.
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
No.
They're legal now.
Where is she?
I don't know.
Who made it?
The police? They know less than you do.
Do you think she's safe?
Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.
I'm only human, you know.
Get out.
But this is my apartment.
Like what?
Where'd you hear that name?
What happened, pilgrim?
Just leave me alone.
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
What is it, Jake?
How's your business, Jake?
Jake?
Wes, do me a favor.
Just do what I say. Don't ask.
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
That's not true, Mr...?
Where is she? Where is the girl?
Where does he hang out?
I don't know.
No.
What you got in mind?
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
Who told you about this?
Is this with a girl named Kristen?
Well...
Take it or leave it.
You wait here. I'll find out where she is.
Where's Ratan?
Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?'
It's a short film.
This is from the movie I was talking about.
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.
But I...
Here. Take your fifty cents back.
No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
Sounds all right.
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
He asked me. You going with anybody?
I don't know.
You ever play Chicken?
What's that?
You never heard of that?
Com'on, tell me.
Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.
I'm worried about Jake.
To his own daughter?
You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
Granville's looking for you anyway.
The guy who bought you that ring.
You can fuck off, too.
You're taking a big chance.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
Was he with a girl?
No.
You are at the University, Candy?
Yes, I am.
And what are you studying?
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
Yes.
Oh, I don't have one.
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
Isn't this your vehicle?
Okay, lady. Out.
Haven't we met before?
None of that, lady.
We planted it.
Is this your shovel?
No.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
Then whose name is it registered in?
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Wait here.
Because if you are...
And what do you do, my dear?
How interesting.
Edith was just telling me about her job.
I'm a file clerk.
What do you want?
A block of ice.
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
Eh, no. Thank you.
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
Do you dance?
What?
Do you sing and dance?
Eh, no.
But this is my car.
Yearse!
It's very interesting.
No.
Oh, at the dentist's?
My door is always open.
All right.
Harold?
How about some ginger pie?
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
Me! No. Of course not.
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
What do you think?
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
Why do you say that?
Because they are all the same.
What happened?
Look.
What?
Over there by the courthouse.
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
Why not?
Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
Is he all right?
We'll come back in the morning.
Look, the ice is melting.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
Well, I really don't drink...
No.
Well, I don't...
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
I <u>think</u> I see it.
The ice is melting.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
Well, I really don't smoke.
It's all right.  It's organic.
Of course.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
Maude, do you pray?
Pray? No.  I communicate. 
With God?
Well, why don't you?
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
From the guys who got the matches, of course. 
Maude, I must speak to you.
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
But they'll put me in jail.
Don't you advance on me.
That wasn't very scary.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
How about some candy floss?
You sure have a way with people.
Look at the stars.
- end where I began.
Maude.
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
It looks like you. Thanks.
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
Supper for two.
It's all right. It's organic.
Oh, Harold. 
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
It's true. I can't live without you.
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
I'm getting married.
To whom?
What?
This is insane.
Would you like a cigarette?
Do you play?
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Like a tea ceremony?
Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
Just give me a rough estimate.
Fifteen.
Does that worry you?
Yes. It does.
Ah, yes.
No.
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
Harold?
No.
None at all?
Yes.
You liked your teachers?
Yes.
Your classmates?
Yes.
Your studies?
Yes.
Then why did you leave?
No.  I'd have liked to.
I'd have liked to talk to him.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
The moment of truth.
Yes.
Will they really teach me to shoot?
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
Oh sure.
How about to slit his throat?
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Parasite!
Stay where you are, Harold .
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it.
It's different for us.
We've always been here.
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
Julia.
I knew you'd come.
Yes!
He... he loved me.
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
Yes... Yes. You look...
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
It's a beautiful dress...
She's done it.
She certainly has.
It's coming.
I knew you'd come back.
So... You're Kirsty, huh?
I... I had a visitor.
No bad dreams.
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
The box. I need the box.
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
What do you mean?
The boxes! I TOLD you.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
Get out of the way.
O.K. Let's go.
I've got to finish it.
But I didn't open it! I didn't!
Then why are you here?
No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
I... remember.
Who?
Don't get psychic with me.
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
You were burned by some organic acid.
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
Remind me why I keep doing this.
See? I don't like that --
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
What is it?
I abhor violence.  Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
It's almost over!!
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
What the hell was that? An ape?
I thought you liked being on TV.
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
Son. About Rasputin --
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
Don't look! Turn around.
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
It's her choice --  She's human --
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
Well, you did break out --
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song.
At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?
Sir, may I go first??
I knew those men better than you did --
No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
Those things never work. Never.
Each of us gets a belt.
Don't move. We --
-- should go back. Now!
No. Don't --
Thank you.
Whatcha looking at, John??
Helping you -- I just --
I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
Myers?
Yes?
What took you so long?
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
You want me to hold him down?
Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out --
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
What was that??
Where do you --
"Need" is a good, solid word.
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Hey, your chili's getting cold --
Anything else you --
Well good n-
Alone?
Goodnight, then.
You're going alone?
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
I like that...
Marco...
Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name --
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
He's just pushy.
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
Cocky.
Strong.
He -- loves you.
I know.
It's freezing, isn't it?
Hit me.
Hello, I'm --
Yes, I --
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Pardon?
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
Just take it slowly.
Christ!
What's the problem?
It's my lucky day.
Hi.
Want to buy a bed?
What's happening?
We're leaving.
Alright, let's give it another try.
That your daughter?
Uh-huh.
Got her mother's looks.
Oh.
Julia's my second wife.
The box... you opened it. We came.
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
Let me alone, will you?
No time for argument.
You did this before, right?
Many times.
Nobody escapes us.
We want the man who did this --
Just in time.
We've got such sights to show you --
Please. Get back into bed.
I have to speak to my father.
Julia!
No.
You remember.
No.
One last time. Give me the box.
This isn't happening.
You bastard --
Poor baby.
You're Julia, right?
I'm brother Frank.
Oh.
There is going to BE a wedding?
Oh.  Oh yes.
Well can I come in or not?
I don't want to see the dress.
What about Larry --
I'm very happy.
Julia.
Oh my God.
Don't look at me.
Who are you?
Tell me who you are.
No. God no.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
...somebody...
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
I'm hurting
Good.
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
Not know.
A long time.
This is what began it.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
You're still afraid.
You would be. They tore me apart.
You can't love him.
I don't.
So where's the harm?
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
Maybe.
There's very little I can do about it.
Maybe we should just leave --
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Well we can't just stay here --
Kirsty.
Hi. I got soaked.
There's a towel in the bathroom.
Which is where?
Kirsty? It's very late.
Where's Daddy?
What's the problem?
I have to see my father.
You look terrible. Have you had an accident?
I was here this afternoon.
This afternoon.
No, damn you --
It's ONE of these.
We're going to freeze to death.
Maybe somebody changed the lock.
Like who?
Just a thought --
It smells damp.
How long since you were here?
Why didn't he want to sell it?
Not exactly modern.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
You're still blaming me.
All right.
So what's the argument?
Larry!
Where are you?
Well?
Why not?
How are you doing through there?
What have you done?
You're NOT going to faint.
Shit.
I'm going to throw up.
Take it slowly.
So damn stupid.
You're done worse.
I'll be scarred for life.
Julia?
I'm here.
Are you all right?
Just feeling a bit sick.
Can I get you anything?
Maybe a brandy.
I'll be down in a minute
Who was it?
Is this upsetting you?
Are you all right?
-- I'll go see.
Larry...
Oh baby.
Don't go upstairs.
Huh?
Please...
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong?
I don't know where to begin...
What are you talking about?
Not much fun, is it?
What?
Drinking alone.
Not much.
What are you drinking?
Just soda.
Plain soda?
That depends.
You know it's not often I... you know...
There's a first time for everything.
I suppose that's right.
Well, isn't it?
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
Is this your place ?
Do you care ?
No, not much.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
No personal details?
This isn't the bedroom.
What's going on?
I suppose not.
First time for everything.
You know, you're very beautiful.
Oh Christ.
You're awake. Good girl.
What happened to me?
I'll get the doctor.
Who brought me in here?
You wouldn't believe me.
Who's there?
Kirsty?
I got through.
Where are you?
I found a room.
What did you say?
No Dad.
You'd like the house.
YOU'D like my room.
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
You will keep in touch.
Of course. Every day.
O.K.
Take care, Dad.
Call me tomorrow.
Big house.
You like?
Surprise.
Are you O.K.?
What are you drinking, love?
I've forgotten.
Never better. You sleep well.
Yeah.
I love you, honey.
...maybe we should never have come back.
I have to talk to you.
It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right...
Finished?
He's gone.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
I don't believe it.
I'm afraid it's true.
I want to see.
No you don't.
Get the fuck out of here.
What's the problem?
PLEASE. You're in danger.
We're on the Cointreau.
I won't be able to stand.
You're not going?
Need any help?
I'm here.
I thought we'd lost you.
It's late.
If there's a train.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
I see.
She's so damn... English.
I beg your pardon?
Oh no?
Oh no.
It's not what I heard.
Oh!
Are you alright ?
Your father told me you were working here.
If I make it through the day.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
Are you busy after work ?
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
Can I lend you a hand?
Steve. Thank God you came.
What's wrong?
Don't let them take me, Steve --
What did I say?
I'll come back later, huh?
'Bye.
Do I know you?
Alison's.
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
Play it.
Say it.
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
Not the point.
What did he ever do to you?
He offended me with his terrible taste.
What?
What do you mean, "what?"
What are you snickering about?
I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Suck my ass.
What the fuck is that?
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
None.  Christ!
What's up?
Laura.  Her dad died.
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
The little skate-fuckers.
No way.
We're getting that anyway.
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
Sonic Death Monkey.
Well what about the new Echo --
I have a television.
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
What?
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
He's got one!
On Clark Street!
A couple blocks!  About six!
We work there!
"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.
Hey, Barry.
Oh, hi.
May I help you?
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Pardon me?
Your desert island top-five.
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
What do you mean, four more?
Fine.  That's great.
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Nice friend.
Yeah.
Uh...yes, at the moment.
'Morning, Dick.
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
Great.
I'll tape it for you.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
I always hated this song.
Let's not.
Rob --!
Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
Can I do anything?
What is this.
It's Vince and Justin.
Laura?  Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
You look upset.
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Maybe I should talk to him.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
I dunno.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
I dunno.
You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
Shit!
Hi.
What were the others?
Just the obvious stuff.
What's the obvious stuff?
What?
Did you say something?
Fine.  One.
Nevermind.
You won't like it.
Just ask it!
Is what better?  Better than what?
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
Never?
I haven't felt like it.
We'll talk some other time.
Have you slept with him yet?
Will you call me?
Hello.
Are you still in love with me?
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
You know I'm a good person.
Don't forget your CDs.
Those aren't mine.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
I guess I am.
Are you alright?
Pig died.
Who the fuck's Pig?
Look, are you coming or not?
You're soaking.
Mmnn.
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
I don't want to go back.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
Let's go home.  Okay?
C'mon.  I want to know.
Want to know what, exactly?
What's the difference?
To make you feel better.
No, but...
You're tougher.
Hi.  What are you doing?
Nothing.
Wanna go to dinner?
WHAT?
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
Barry said its done.
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
Are you worried about tomorrow night?
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
I mean it.
I know.
Would you marry me if I was?
No.  Probably not.
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
I don't know.
Very persuasive.
Fair enough.
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
Hey.  It's Liz.
What's happenin'.
It's a crematorium.
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
What difference does it make?
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
So you live in Chicago now?
Hi, Marie.
It's a great song.
The Conformist.
Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
You haven't even seen it!
Are you okay?
So you'll stay?
Yeah.
Which way are you going?
That way.  You?
I'll call you.
Yeah?
Hi, Mom.
Everything all right?
Great.  Super-fantastic.
How's the store?
She left.  She's gone.
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
I knew this was going to happen.
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
What do you think?
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
These are worth at least, I don't know --
But you must have --
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
Sixty.
Thirteen hundred.
Seventy-five.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
I think you have more.
We're not there yet, Justin.
How old is Richard?
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
I warned you.
Doesn't have a head, does he?
Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
Claymore.
You're the expert.
You're very macabre.
It's my birthday.
Happy birthday.
Would you like more tea?
He was unsual.
Would you remember his name?
-Okay okay.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
Do you play?
Yes.
Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
Byzantine?
Grave robbers?
Probably.
People like that rarely leave business cards.
You have an active imagination.
Why not?
He called you "MacLeod".
That bothers you?
What about me?
I'd rather hear yours.
He sees me as a threat.
No.
No one knows you're here?
No.  I had to talk to you.
You had to do _nothing_!
You're wrong.
You're a fool.
Is this what you killed them with?
Not all of them.
It's some sort of party the town is throwing.
Maybe it would do us both good.
It's beautiful.
At least.
A factor of age.
I'm not even sure why.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
Who are you?
That would be difficult to explain.
Yes.
He knows about you.
I didn't kill the watchman.
You killed those other two.
Not the same.
There are differences.
You kill with your left hand?
I haven't killed _you_.
Don't.
Come here, Brenna.
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
What is it you want?
Get out.
I'm calling an attorney.
You and I should talk first.
Four?
All fashionably without heads.
You're an asshole, Moran.
What's all of this got to do with me?
What were you doing in Felton?
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
Corey, you _owe_ me.
It's that important?
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
I don't believe him.
Requiem acer'nam donaei-
What are you doing man?
Be quiet.
-Auditorium nostrum-
Stop.
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Afternoon.
Your name is Conor?
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
Your marks would suggest great injury.
I was nearly killed.
It is less.
You feel you know me.
I don't know why.
I don't understand.
You are still so very young.
I'm twenty-two.
What?
It is as you are.
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
This is madness!
It is the truth.
This can't be.
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
Harder.  Concentrate harder.
Me arm hurts.
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
Impotent cow.
It will take less effort as you learn.
You have a gift.  One you must protect.
What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.
I'm your future husband, remember?
My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
Some think not.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
Oh please.  Another one.
What would you like?
Far away.
Who am I deceiving?
Tradition.
Romirez understood.  Not you.
Finish your prayers?
Your name?
What is your position?
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
Wait.  I think we understand each other.
We must talk.
Do not turn your back on me.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Ah, Conor, how you look a man.
Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
Where did you learn that?
My father taught me.
Figure she's with him?
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
Where!
I don't know.
Smith.  Carl Smith.
How many came?
The last four.
And the Bulgarian?
Spare a chair?
How are you?
Head still secure to the neck.
And have you something to settle with me?
He found us even there.
I haven't drunk this much since-
I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.
I knew his great-grandfather.
Long time.
You've been here from the start.
Friend of yours?
Run!
Leave her out of this.
What's the point?
This isn't done.  Get up.
Tradition.
It's all we have.
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
Leave her alone.
We have some unfinished business.
Are you here?
I want you to come to me.
This your present address?
Did you know the victim?
What were _you_ looking for?
That's none of your business.
Do you know what this is?
A mystery.
My condolences.
Where were you Tuesday night?
A neighbor saw your car leave.
Do you?
Steven, Conor didn't die.
You're one of William's kids, huh?
We were very close.
The resemblance is amazing.
When may I expect the cleaners?
Morning Mr. North
Nothing to be sorry about.
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
What doing?
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Who is it?
What's the idea of locking this?
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
I'll keep you in mind.
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
What's the matter?
I lost my wallet.
Did you finish the interview?
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
Hildy!
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Oh, she was here.
Where'd she go?
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
You're Bruce Baldwin?
Attaboy!  Come on, Bruce.
Mother? But your mother --
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
Well, she'll know some day.
Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.
Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office. 
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
You'll ask me to what?
You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
Call Duffy!
No, you don't!
What's this?
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
Save that for the Tribune.
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
What?!!
I have a lunch date. I just want --
You can break it, can't you?
No, I can't.
What do you mean by that?
Just what I said. That's what I --
You've had a better offer, eh?
What's the matter?
Sweeney.
You've got to help me, Hildy.
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
Where'd you meet this man?
Bermuda.
What's his line?
He's in the insurance business.
The insurance business?
Say, could I meet him?
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
You're not afraid, are you?
Then what does he want with you?
Now you got me.
Allow me.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
Never mind that. What's the story?
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?
Yes. Where is he?
She jumped out of the window.
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
Hildy!
How much do you want on it?
All the words you've got.
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
Hildy!
What tickets?
I'm finished.
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
What did you do with her?
What happened?
Where is she? Tell me!
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
Look at me, Hildy --
Hello -- hello...
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
Ring that number, will you?
Will you come here?
No, you don't! Walter!
When did you deliver this first?
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
How was that for a tight squeeze?
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
I don't know what to do, Walter.
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
Then why are you doing it?
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
How about Bruce's?
But, Hildy -- I can explain --
Are you referring to me, Madam?
You grey-haired old Judas!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
You stay here. I'll find out everything.
You know me. The shirt off my back.
You got plenty of money?
Sure, boss.
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
Walter!
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
He's on my phone. He just called me.
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
You said it!
They're always after me for interviews.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
I call. What you got?
Three bullets! Any good?
Who locked the door?
Open up there, will you!
Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
She looks as though she's going to come to.
Give me a hand with her, will you?
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.
You guys wanna play some more poker?
Boy, did you see her go?
No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it.
So have we!
Hold the phone!
Goodbye, Yonson.
You ain't gettin' out o' here!
We know what you're up to.
How's everything, Gus?
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
Little rum in yours, too?
No -- just coffee, Gus.
Gus, this --
You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
Just a minute, Johnson!
Take your paws off me!
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
What?
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
After all I've done for you --
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
For who?
Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
Pete, I want to talk to you!
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
Pete, you're through!
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
Pure politics!
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
I did.  Hold the wire.
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
We'll fix that, too. 
What?
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
Who is this man?
That's a lie!!
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
Five hundred dollars.
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
Where's the old lady?
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
Phone for you, Hildy.
Who is it?
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
There goes another scrub lady.
You fight it cut.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
Did you get that, Hildy?
Look out, you --
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
Come on with that money!
First you got to sign a receipt. 
Here!
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
Kings and sixes.
Hiding him where?
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
Mother!
A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course.
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Isn't that her picture?
Don't forget about production for use.
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
What good'll it do?
They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
What's that?
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
What's the idea?
Hey --
Are you all right, now?
What's from the Governor?
Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
Who? Me?
The what?
The City Sealer's office!
You mean here in the city?
I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
No, I don't think so.
I'll explain it tomorrow!
Is it hard?
Get out of here!
They wouldn't take it.
Here's the picture of my wife.
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.
Get the cops, somebody.
There she is!
What's your hurry?
Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
What's he want?
The door was locked.
That was a googly!
This is going too far, young man.
Give him the you-know-what.
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
Only till they get you into the local school.
Pauline's mum got killed.
No, she didn't.
I never was.
I know a secret.
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
You want to join our gang?
Yes.
Bugger off.
Sod.
Sod.
Bloody.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
You wouldn't.
Would.
You couldn't.
Ask her yourself.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
It's easy. I've done it.
Who with?
Can't we just see the end?
They've got the real thing outside.
I'm starting my own collection.
Well, for the baby, really.
Crocodiles! Aah!
Boy, that was some air-raid.
Where?
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
Why not?
You need trees for an avenue.
Except the servicemen.
You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
So you're going to be a grandfather.
And I'm still just a lad myself.
Here's to music. And absent friends.
Has Sue got it right?
What's that?
You joined up.
And what's that?
Well?
It looks....foreign.
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
When do you think you'll get leave again?
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
You know it? It must be an old one.
He always knows.
What is it, pet?
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
I don't believe this is happening to me.
It looks a bit fishy to me.
Is it peace in out time?
No, Mother! It's War! War!
Up to six weeks, I think.
I can't do it. What's the point?
It seems to have survived.
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
He could always make me laugh.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
You might still have a house.
I wish it could all have been different.
Am I? Maybe I am.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
Cone.
Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
Tiny's home.
Ma, Tiny's in.
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
Drink up, it's party time.
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Who's your Daddy!
Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
What about the tree?
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
Christ, you scared the shit out of me.
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Is your brother ready to go?
He left!
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
Thank you.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
That's not something to joke about.
Hey, great they're back.
I'd like to see that.
Can I help you with something?
I was just wondering.
What the hell are you laughing about?
He walks, duh.
Take that, you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore!
You shouldn't a done that.
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
Great story Goober, how much?
Come on, bro. Let's go.
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
But if you did.
Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
How awesome?
Keep straight on this road here.
It's a hitchhiker.
She looks like she stinks.
What was that?
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
Well, technically I did what ya said.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Thanks.
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
I like sleep.
Honk at him. Scare him.
Fuck! We are fucked!
Just grin and bear it.
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
Why are we stopping?
Go around him.
There's not enough room.
Fine. I'll go straight.
What!
Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
What are you doing!
I gotta open the gate.
Drive through it!
Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
Aw, come on. It will be fun.
Ugh, what's that smell?
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Really, now is not the time to make waves.
What are you laughing at?
I don't know, I think he's funny.
We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
That was good babe, just keep doing that.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Sleeping.
No please, let me sit this one out.
A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
Don't even say it.
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
How long has it been?
What was that?
What? I didn't hear anything.
I don't hear anything.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
A couple hours!
Yeah, no mercy here.
Recover any bodies?
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
You find something, Georgie?
What'd ya got there?
Huh?
Open up the trunk.
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
Oh, right.
What do they call you, sweety?
And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
I'll go. It's my fault.
Huh?
That stupid hillbilly slut.
This is way too fucked up for words.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
I suggest you kids leave now.
Where is he?
What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
I um... no, I don't think so...
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
Turn up this road.
Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?
Tell it to my daughter.
Jesus Christ.
Mr. Willis?
Yes, sir.
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
I always favored the Hulk.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
Aw, fuck.
Plates match.
I guess not.
Wydell.
That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
Say my name.
You remind me so much of Nathan.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
French?
No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
Thank you so much for accompanying me.
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
Is everything fine?
Oui.
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
What is wrong, my darling?
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
Hmmmph.
Not in front of the boy.
My little French.
Stop. Get away.
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
Yeah? What?
Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?
Well?
Please. I look a mess.
I've moved on.
You were wonderful!
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
I want our boy back.
I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
No.
My apologies, madam.
It's okay, Puff.
Very well.
I want to be the way I was before.
Progress!
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
Shut up and tell me.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
Loves animals. Loves you.
My brother is discreet.
I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
One night stand?
No. I married a midget.
Oh?
Yeah. My brother told me.
And I think I'm going to.
Lila, it's Rosie.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Please, honey, let me in.
Rose, please go away.
How'd you know where I was?
Nathan told my brother.
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
Done!
I'm going to miss you.
Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
You've got to respect that.
My God! The fork! The fork!
Boy, this is good!
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
You do?
Yes, and...
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
I like you, too, Nathan.
Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.
What are you doing in there?
I'll be out in a minute.
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
Yes, darling.
Oh, and the sun block?
Of course.
What SPF, sweetie?
Yes.
Flares?
That's very funny.
What?
I don't know. Something.
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
What?
What are you doing in there?
Who is it?
Who from work?
You have to shave? Like an ape?
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
Of course not.
Do you like my new look?
Really?
That's great. It's a great color for you.
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
How's work?
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
Bravo to you, Puff!
I think he's ready.
You just have to control it. We're not apes.
Should I come with?
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
So he's doing okay?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
Yahoo!
Extra dessert?
So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
Wait!
Mother?
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
Boys just passing through?
Yep.
Pittsburgh?
Mm hmm.
About sixty, seventy bucks.
Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
You want a chaser?
Check!
Huh?
I'm ready.
What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
That's right, Miss Packard.
And a fact is a fact.
Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.
I want to talk to you.
You know what's good for him?
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
How?
Are you ready for another?
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
We'll be there.
Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
How much?
Oh, about five hundred.
That seems a shame. The night is young.
How much do I owe you?
Hey, mister.
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
Okay?
Make it twenty.
Cut.
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
I'm buyin'.
Only when I work.
I lost twenty bucks.
Poker's not your game.
What is?
Pool.
Character.
He drank as much whisky as you did.
Whaddya been so far?
Eddie, you're a born loser.
Thanks for the drink.
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
Seventy-five per cent.
For who?
Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money?
Now, when did you adopt me?
Hello, Eddie.
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Man named Turk Baker?
Sign up.
You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
What happened to you anyway?
I been thinking.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
Hey, Findley's here.
Where?
Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?
So does Eddie.
Well, we won't.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
How do we stand?
'Bout even.
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
I can beat him.
I'll beat him the next game.
How're the hands?
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
I wanna walk.
It's a long walk.
I got time, Bert.
Tell her what?
Well, here it's half.
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
Maybe. You want to play?
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
What's your game? What do you shoot?
Yeah, that's right.
He's my partner.
It's gonna cost ya money. It always does.
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
How do you feel?
Fast and loose, man.
In the gut, I mean.
Quit. He's too good.
Hey, how much are we ahead?
No, it isn't, Charlie.
The pool game is over when Fats says it's over.
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
Give me a drink, will ya?
You don't need a drink.
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Hello, Charlie...  C'mon in...  That's my girl.
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
I want you to come back on the road with me.
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
What for? To play Fats again?
Is that what you think?
Just like that?
No, no more for me.
Findley.
Now and then. Why, do you?
When?
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
You gentlemen care for a drink?
There it is. I'm broke.
Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
Hey, uh, mister? Hey, okay if I grab a cue?
Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
What's the limit?
Half and a dollar.
Hi.
How much you playin' for?
A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
You quittin' too?
You're a pretty good player.
How much are you ahead?
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
Try me.
Okay, friend. You're on.
Call it.
You quittin', friend?
Long wait for a bus?
How long you been waiting?
How long have you been waiting?
What time does the bus leave?
What bus?
Yours.
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
Have a nice trip.
Have a nice trip?
Fair.
Can I sit down?
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
It's the lights. And the scotch.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Do you always ask so many questions?
You talk kind of funny, but I like it.
I used to be an actress.
You don't look like a college girl.
I'm not.
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
No.
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
What time is it?
Why?
What did you say that for, Sarah?
You told me.
I'm not sure... I don't know.
Where you been all day?
At school. It's Thursday.
What did all this stuff cost you?
When you've got money, you'll pay.
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Don't you ever cook anything?
Oh, cut my finger.
I've got something in my bag.
Eddie, what's in that case?
Haven't you opened it?
Do you want me to go?
Give it to me.
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
Would he know?
He knows. A lot.
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
He's a gambler.
Well, he owns things.
I love you.
You glad?
Sherry.  Very old, very dry.
What is it, Eddie?
Nothin'.  Want another drink?
What do you want to tell me?
For how long?
Oh, I don't know.
A week? A year?
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
No, I want to walk.
Leave now.
Oh, grow up.
Fifty-seven.
Where's Bert?
Why?
Go on back to the hotel.
Where do you come from?
I hear you've been looking for me.
That's what the game's all about.
Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
I came to play pool, Fats.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
You name it.
...you shoot a great game of pool.
You lived like this once.
That is not now, human!
Are you all right?
Do you remember where you lived?
What about... now?
With them?
Yes.
When you're here, in the city, where do you live?
Who is this?
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
What?
You want to find them.
Yes.
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
What do you mean?
We don't know that --
Mine.
Have you always had it?
I don't know.
Have you looked inside?
What's inside?
Humans.
Who?
You want me to stay?
Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
Virginia...?
Need some gas?
Please.
Only got one kind.
Hell of a night.
You built things.
Bathroom?
Son ... are you awake?
We're going to be moving, son.
What's that, Dad?
Is the hill ours too?
If we want it, it is.
Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
There are more this year than last.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
Are you all right, Dad?
I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.
I had an awful dream.
What, Jim, what?
... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.
I was so scared.
What happened to you?  Who was that?
Where's your car?
I'm home now.
He was upset with moving, I believe.
Is that all he said?
May I ask why?
We were having a little talk.
I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
I'd believe him.
Why?
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
I don't see anything.
I swear it was here.
But it's not, Jimmy.
Does it look to you like anything landed here?
Who are you calling?
Did you call the State Police?
No one comes here after dark.
Damn.
But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
George, where have you been?
Your father asked you a question.
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
Oh?
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
What do you want?
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
What?
Connie, don't hang up.
David? How'd you get this number?
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
What do you want me to do?
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
Just my luck, no ice.
You still believe in him.
He's a good man.
Are you all right?
Did it work?
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
We're losing them.
What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
What the hell is this?
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
There's good news and bad news.
What's the bad news?
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
Can you believe this?
What're you talking about?
What happened?
Not really...
That signal. It's a countdown.
Then what?
I'm thinking.
What the hell is that?
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
Spunky?
College nickname.
Perfect, she's using it.
You punched the President in the face?
David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
I'm making a mess.
Pops, you're a genius!
What'd I say?
Oh shit, we're late.
What the hell are you doing?
Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
Get us out of here!
What're you doing?
Nice meeting you.
We're loose!
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
I had a feeling you would.
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
Is my wife in the air?
Where are they?
How're we doing?
And our troops here?
Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
A meteor?
No Sir. Definitely not.
How do you know?
Well, er... it's slowing down.
It's doing what?
He's trying to impress you.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
What?
Yes, I am.
You're late.
You scared the hell out of me.
Yeah, but what an entrance!
Dick-weed.
He's my angel.
I'm a dancer.
Really? Ballet?
No. Exotic.
Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it...
Damn it!
I didn't even see them fire!
Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
We're already over Mach 2!
Stevie... I can't...
Stop it.
But I gave you some this morning.
We're leaving, don't try and stop us.
What the hell's going on?
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
Mr. President?
Why did you people come here?
Here... now.
And before here?
Peace? No peace.
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
My reputation precedes me.
Yes.
Yes.
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
May we go home now, please?
Marcus!  I did it!
All your life.
What has the old fool got himself into now?
Venice, Italy!
That doesn't look much like a library.
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
Alexandretta. Now we know.
What about you?
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
Henry! What are you doing here?!
Henry, the pen --
Look what you did!
The Word of God...
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
That was our assessment as well.
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
I'm through!
Doctor Jones?
Yes?
And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
I usually don't.
It would make me very happy.
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
The Ark of the Covenant.
Are you sure?
It must be one of these...
Don't wander off.
You said go between them!
My room!
Mine, too.
This.
The Grail Diary.
At least I let you tag along.
What do you know about this place?
What are you going to do?
This one. I think he's in here.
How did you get here?
You came back for the book? Why?
I never expected to see you again.
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
Dad!
Out!
It's important!
Then wait -- count to twenty.
It is you Junior!
Don't call me that, please.
But what are you doing here?
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
I'll never forgive myself --
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
Through the library?
He was actually there? You saw him?
Well, what was left of him.
...you did it.
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
If only I could have been with you.
There were rats, Dad.
They want my diary.
Well, uh...
Look, can we discuss this later?
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
I came here to save you.
No! Don't Shoot!
How did you she was a Nazi?
Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
What am I looking for?
My lucky charm.
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
The floor's on fire! See?!
What???
Dad!
What?
Dad!
What?
What?
Head for the fireplace!
Dad!
Stop!
What?
Brody's this way.
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
What final challenge?
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
What about Marcus?
Marcus would agree with me.
I was the next man.
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
We didn't talk. We never talked.
You left just when you were becoming interesting.
Dad, how can you?
What does that mean?
I didn't know you could fly a plane.
Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
Nice landing.
I know, Dad!
This is intolerable!
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
You call this archaeology?
Dad?!
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
Penitent. Penitent...
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
What did you find, Dad?
What did you find, Junior?
Ready?
You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
Get that camel out of the way!
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
I'm going after those horses.
I'll take the camels.
I don't need camels.
But, Indy --
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
Why are you trying to kill us?
Then we'll die.
This is your last chance.
Who are you?
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.
I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
That was a misunderstanding.
Dr. Jones.
Lao She.
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.
You have insulted my son.
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
Now what about the antidote, Lao.
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
Step on it, Short Round!
You got the tickets, Short Round?
Indy?
Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
I ride with you, Indy?
Indy, look!
What you look at, Indy?
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
You don't like him do you?
Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
Come one, what's wrong?
Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
Let up on the brake!
No, the stones are mine!
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
It is Pankot Palace that kills my village.
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
I like the service here.
Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!
What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!
Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!
He told me they knew I was coming here.
What do you mean -- how?
The old man saw it in a dream.
God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
And then they took their children.
A what...?
Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?!
Don't let it pull you deeper!
It's pulling me deeper!
What?!
Can you move your arm?
What's happening?
It's starting to let go!
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.
Couldn't keep away, huh?
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
Not leftovers?
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
Don't catch cold.
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
No -- don't you see -- crawling --
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
Wait -- what're you doing?
I'm going down.
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
You've got to go to sleep now.
Yes.
So now they believe me.
What're we going to do?!
I can't!
Anymore ideas...?
And they don't even know what it really is.
I get it!
This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
Give me your hat...
What for?
I said something.
No, not her. Me.
You're not gonna believe this...
Try me.
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
Don't do that.
Arrrgh!
It wasn't him.
Who was it?
Who?
Al.
Yes?
You're in my head...
Yes.
Your name is Al...
Yes.
Why don't we go home?
...I need to make a phone call.
Yeah?
Somebody's been here.
Where are we now?
My place, can't you see?
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
Who are you?
Who am I?
I told you, my name is Al.
You've heard of the PEM114...
I don't know what you're talking about.
You've heard of U.S.T.?
I just went there for a job.
I know...it sounds insane.
What are you doing?
Loading a gun.
What for?
Kill myself.
Are you crazy?
You're not crazy.
Hear voices don't I.
Of course you do!
Yeah.
You'll be alive.
What was that?
No they won't.
Why not?
I'll talk to them.
Oh...Gooood!
Behind us?
Outrun them.
I wouldn't say that.
I want out.
Too late...They want you.
Why? AL  You know too much.
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
I don't know...To get Al.
Did you hear that?
It can't take that long.
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
Yeah...Who is?
I am. You are.
What do you mean we.
You gotta help.
I did. I brought you back here.
Find You?
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
Sue them.
Door's locked.
Now what.
Go out, take your first left.
Just walk down the hall?
Which way do I go?
What does it say.
Take a left and your next right.
A lab and equipment.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
Who did?
Like the guys that attacked us.
What do you mean?
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
I'm back.
I'm at the airport.
Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
What am I supposed to do?
What is it?
What do we do?
Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
You mean...just leave.
We get on a plane.
What about money?
What about it?
I don't have any.
Use my credit cards.
I can't do that.
Why not?
It's illegal.
Who cares?
I'll get in trouble.
They'll know who I am.
It's just not enough.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
Oh yeah, to what?
The beach.
Eating sushi?
Holy shit!
Swim.
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
Now what?
The sand.
Eat it?
Eat it.
I don't want to eat it.
Why not?
Al, are you doing anything in there?
What? What do you mean?
Beautiful!
What was?
She's...pretty fast.
You're beautiful..
What's happening?
She doesn't seem to understand.
Try another language.
Which language?
Help me out, will you?
What do I do?
.
Wait.
Touch her.
What happened?
Where are you going?
To the hotel. To register.
Without your pants.
Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
It worked.
Yeah. I did it.
Now, where would I be?
But what's it look like?
You really like that shirt?
Much too blue.
Mind your own business.
It is my business. It's my name.
Not that tie with that coat.
What did that cost?
Which one is she?
They both look good to me.
Get close to them.
What glasses.
Follow that busboy.
I feel like an idiot.
Which one?
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
Just don't show fear.
I don't know what's going on.
They're all in it.
How do you know?
Even Rene?
She's the toughest to read.
This just won't work.
You're doing great with her.
Not her. You!
What is it?
It's embarrassing.
What am I supposed to do?
You got any books in there?
Oh come on.
You shut down your sensors.
She's got the most beautiful...s
And on my time.
It's not your time. I get time off.
Some agent you are.
Bingo.
You found her.
Better. I found Ryuji.
Osaka.
Osaka?
What do I do?
Follow her.
On what?
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
Sapporo..
Just stay here and rest.
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
What do I do?
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
I told you, I have a feeling...
Don't touch a thing.
...drink it.
What next!
I can't...
You have to! Quickly!
Door to the right. Get up and run.
I can't see a thing.
What?
He was with Gruner!
Probably.
Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
I've got an idea.
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
What was it? What'd I say?
haka xuki.
haka xuki. What's that mean?
He hung us up dry.
While he makes the run.
Do it.
I can't handle that thing.
There's a lot you don't know.
Do something.
What exactly?
What happened?
Where've you been?
Never mind that, where are we now.
Rene?
She works for them.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
She is beautiful.
Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.
You're a lucky man.
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
You just got a Mickey.
Not that truth!
Doesn't matter.
What part what?
What is your name?
No!
Oh, I can't.
I'm against it.
Can you fly this?
What kind of a deal?
Let us get to the border!
I knew you were trouble.
What happened?
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
In him?
It's a long story.
They have stolen state property.
Who's our little man?
You didn't tell us you were coming?
You've cut your hair?
PEM115!
Surveillance Cameras?
They took the tapes.
We'll have to let them go.
What Job?
Who is your friend?
We met on the beach.
What are you doing here, where've you been?
I have a new client.
That crazy guy?
He's not an ordinary man.
Enough ROmance.
I don't want to intrude.
Al Viola.
And...you know Jan Gruner?
What?
Your memory.
What about it?
It may have been affected.
Oh.
You may not remember things.
Oh...that's okay.
When you do...
Do what?
When you remember...
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
Right.
How do I look?
Fine. You look fine.
Thanks.
Well what?
We're here.
Don't you want to get out?
I feel fine.
You'll feel better
Joe.
What?
Take the card.
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
Why would we want to hurt you?
Not you. Them.
Who?
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
Ahhh...nothing.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Not...complaining, actually.
Sue who?
Don't do it!
Just give me the keys.
How's that Trucklhouser Beer?
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
The fresh tuna?..
What's what?
What do you want?
Nothing.
What did you say?
Nothing.
I said...I didn't say..anything!
Oh...and who is it!?
What do you do about what?
Is someone else here?
No. No one to speak of.
...Blake
The poet...something he said...
I'll be right there.
Where?
Dinner...tonight.
And you.
...right here too.
I can't do that?
Do what?
Let you leave without it.
What way?
You mean from it.
You again.
Me still. They left you alone?
I waited for you.
It's not apparent.
As if your mind's not all there.
I am sort of scattered.
You are.
Promise you what?
You talk to yourself.
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
Why do you do it?
You're talking to me.
And how'm I doing?
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
...Naw. Made that up.
Trans Ocean Travel.
Is that Ryuji?
No. Ryuji just hires us.
How often they come here?
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
And you, what do you like?
Joe! What happened to you?
Why did you leave?
They left. I had to go with them.
Why did you stay with me?
Why?
You seemed interesting.
Who else is interested in me?
What do you mean?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
They kidded me a little.
What did you tell them?
There's not much to tell.
You work for Ryuji?
Sometimes. I told you I did.
No, he didn't do that.
He didn't.
No.
Who did?
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
You're leaving.
Food doesn't agree with me.
I'm leaving too.
Why?
This business is over.
You know where he went?
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
We're very close.
What'd he steal?
A chip. Goes in a computer.
How do you know you can trust me?
I don't know. He mentioned a city.
What is it?
Hiroshima.
You don't believe me.
Ryuji and Gruner.
Where we going?
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
That must be him. Water taxi.
Hong Kong.
I asked him.
Chiang Cho?
You've  been there?
I know the territory.
So do I.
This going to work?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
Why not?
Can you?
What happened?
I can't fly it.
Looks like they can. What did they do?
What did you tell them?
That I really don't know.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Why did you, then?
How?
Now what?
Just like that?
I'll come back for you.
Kiss her you fool.
Who are you? Who do you work for?
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
I knew it. I told him.
Now what?
He can't help us.
You are, I've seen you.
It wasn't me. It was him.
It was you.
He told me what to do.
Come on.
What is it?
He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
Yeah...I have to get away.
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
What could you find in this place?
I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
What about the others.
Is there anything else?
Why?
You can't take that.
Why not?
It's alright.
It will be fine. You have another.
Just one. The back up.
Could I have it, please.
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Tear it apart?
Yes.
Mom...what are you doing here?
This the only spare?
Yes.
The other working.
Ow?...
It'l be alright.
It will.
It doesn't hurt.
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
What does he know?
Look, nobody knows we did it.
It'l take months.
Hi, honey.
Hi, Daddy.
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
Yeah? What for?
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
I'll take some.
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
I heard them.
He's into kind of little cars, that...
Yeah.
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
Mom.
Yes, baby?
How long?
Three hours.
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
We gotta hook up.
P.J.'s.
When's your deadline?
Monday.
Push it.
What? Forget it.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
Are you all right?
What does that do?
When's the air date?
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
What was that about?
Get me Wigand.
Sure.
Do you want more rice?
Maybe later.
What are you cooking?
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm not touching my film...
Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
A gun? Yes.
What caliber is your gun?
What caliber is my gun?
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
That computer has everything...
Debbie...
What about you, you got a crew already?
Okay. 
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
No, no, we're fine...
Mike... Mike... Mike...
What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"
Hello?
Okay.  Lowell?
I can take her.
Is there any more rice...?
Uh, what are those boxes?
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
Soy sauce...
That's my stuff from the office...
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
I didn't want to leave it there...
Why? Who said?
...taping?  What are you taping?
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
Where should I wash them?
Use the bathroom.
What's the difference...
Thank you, Bob.
Who's calling?
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
"60 Minutes"?
Yeah.
"60 Minutes," the television show?
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
Will independent sources corroborate that?
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye. 
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
What's wrong?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
What are you and Mike going to do?
I'm alone on this...
Jeffrey Wigand...
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
Get some perspective, Lowell.
I got perspective.
Yeah...
...you fucked me!
Alright.
Area code 212-555-0199.
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
Hardly new news.
No shit.
So, is everything okay?
Oh, man.
Lowell!
What?
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
I disappeared on you?
Alright. What did you think?
Oh, lots.
Oh, please, Mike...
That Canada story? Still interest you?
Coffee?
Yeah... Thank you.
How have you liked your stay?
Look, I really don't have that much time...
...but that's as far as I go...
Did work.
Should I just take the documents now?
...protect your sources...! You screwed me! You sold me out!
Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
Why am I gonna mention your name?
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
How'd you know that, Lowell?
What did you get us?
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
You believe that?
You believe that?
Jeff, call the FBI right away...
They do this with impunity!
You attract a crowd.
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
What's changed?
You mean... since this morning?
No.
ABC...?
That's bullshit, Jeff!
Where are you, anyway?
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
You try and have a good time.
Did he hear you?
What's happening?!
What are you talking about?
There is -- there is no family.
What do you mean there is no family?
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
Object to the form of the question!
It acts as a drug on the body?
Object to the form!
It acts as a...
Well, I wouldn't say --
Baby. You are so HOT!
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
I'd just like to have a word with her.
Who's the pigeon?
Is that... one person?
You're in a rush.
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
That's his lawyer.
Triple!
Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
Objection, your honor!
Grounds?
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
We rest, Your Honor.
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
I don't need it.
You want Botox?
Why in God's name would I want...?
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
It was a gift from a client.
Set one side for Bel Air.
You're in check.
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
I'm happy for you, pal.
Thanks, buddy.
Is she Asian?
Asian? No.
I have it.
No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
It's your move, Miles.
My God.
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
Marylin! What have I done?
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
So who'd you hire?
No.
You're vulnerable.
You said 'yes' didn't you?
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
Oh boy. If he only knew.
It sounded like a bell.
I assume this is on Rex?
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
Did you see the tape?
But you don't agree?
Why would you be here?
No.
You don't believe in it.
You just haven't met the right person.
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
He'll regret this.
Getting married.
To him? He's a sick freak.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
So I hear. Is that all?
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
Hello?
Miles?
Screw you, asswipe!
No. Don't stop.
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
Is that you?
Me. Yes.
Oh. And that is -- mom?
She never particularly cared for me.
She held that against you?
And here I thought my mother was...
Your mother was.
We're damaged goods.
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
What is it Miles?
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
Yes, Miles. I accept.
I know.
Hi.
I have a surprise for you.
I love you. I want to have your baby.
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
What do you want?
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
STUFF.  Got a light?
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
That's blackmail.
Hello?
You have to leave the house immediately!
Please! Leave the house.
It's a no go, Joe.
Marylin!
Wait! He works for YOU?
Now. But first, he worked for you.
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
Hello Marylin.
You wounded me first, Marylin.
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Forgery? Fraud?
Income tax evasion?
Murder?
Sweet.
Rex. Get away from the door.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
Hello, Rex.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
Do you need a Tagamet?
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
I was devastated. Of course.
Who's that?
Forgery and Fraud?
He never even asked. He just assumed --
He was right, wasn't he?
You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
She did a Harriman.
Lilly's up.
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
Wait. I know you.
Herb wants to see me?
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
Ha Ha.
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
Oh brother. Here we go.
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
Where does that leave us?
Mr. Rexroth.
Thank you.
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
Mm.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
I don't know. I can assume...
I think that went as well as could be expected.
She always looked out for me.
She brought my digestive enzymes.
In anticipation of making you sick.
Nothing.
And she has...?
Video.
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
I am very sorry.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
What do you think?
What are they?
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
What...?
She owes me a meal.
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
Wrigley?
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there.
That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
OhMary
Yes, sir?
How is she?
Whyuhshe's all right, sir.
Oh, no, sir. No different than
Mr. Warne?
Yeah.
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
And this is what you wantthirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
What ten thousand?
The reward.
You're a peculiar chap.
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
Because marrying that fool King Westley is
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
Where are you taking me?
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
I'll get it annulled.
What've you got against King Westley?
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
Ellie
I knocked several times.
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
Oh, yes. I heard.
No.
I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
I'd like to have a talk with him.
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
No, I'll go through with it.
Is that his name?
Peter Warne! 
Why? Do you know him? 
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
I'm sorry you read it.
Are you going to see him?
I'll be going.  Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
She hasn't had a thing yesterdayor today.
Been sending her meals in regularly?
Yessir. She refuses them all.
It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one
It's my daughter! Go after her.
You talk as if
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
We've done that already.
What happened?
What do they say?
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
All right, let it go.
Oh, yeah?
Driver!
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
Tell that man not to drive so fast. 
Are you talking to me?
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
What am I going to do now?
You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
Why, noI  Yes . . . I guess I will.
I don't want it reported!
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
My ticket?
I found it on the seat.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. 
I didn't ask for your advice. 
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
That's none of your business.
Are you talking to me!
Darn clever, these Armenians.
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
Oh, you did? What am I expected to doleap for joy?
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
Do you mind putting out the light?
You've got a name, haven't you?
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  Youyou had it pressed.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
I can't go out like this.
Like what?
Like this. I have no robe.
Where'd you say the showersand thingswere? 
Heyyou're little, aren't you?
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
I thought maybeuh"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Santa Claus?
KingKing Westley was in it.
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
Oh, so now I was drunk!
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story?
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
Not as long as I'm alive.
What do you meanstarvation?
It takes money to buy food.
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
To New York?
Yeah.
I'm following you.
Aren't you afraid of me?
No.
This isn't "piggy-back."
Of course it is.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride
Not a one.
This looks like the best spot.
Peter
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
Well, take them off.
What's the matter?
Oh, Peter 
What's got into you?
knowbut
Here. Eat your head off.
I don't want it now.
Thought you were hungry!
wasbut
But what!
Sure.
What are you thinking about?
No. But I've got a penknife. 
Carrots.
Raw?
There's no end to your accomplishments.
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
What're you going to do?
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
Why not? I'm hungry.
Eat a carrot.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on
Come on! come on! 
What'd you give him for the car?
Nope.
Better go back to your bed.
I love you.
You bet I did.
Congratulations.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
ONETWOTHREEFOURFIVE
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
sixseveneightnine
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
No, it isn't. I'm hungry andand scared.
Not interested. 
Where's the bus to New York?
Eight o'clock tonight.
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
When does the bus leave?
In about fifteen minutes.
Yesif he is your husband.
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
But can't you wait until morning
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
I've been thinking about you.
What time is it?
I'm hungry.
The old man's screwy!
What's 'at?
What's up?
Yeah? Where?
Up yonder. See the lights?
Yeah.
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Mr. Gordon
Yes.
Get out of here!
Wait a minute, GordonI
Joe, listen
If it's on the level.
Well, I got it, Joe.
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
I'd put you there myself.
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
I am, Joe.
You!
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
ain't got a hat
What?
Funny couple, ain't they?
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
Send it collect.
Collect?
There you gotrustin' people again. How many times did I tell you
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Thenyou'll have to git !
Not a minute!
Yeah.
Zeke.  Git!
There's a seat over there for you.
Wife?
What's on your mind?
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
I can use a smart guy like you.
Yeahthe "big boy"the Boss of the outfit.
Orange, New Jersey.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Yeah. Just babies.
You love them, don't you?
Oh, gee, Misteryou wouldn'tyou ain't thinkin' about
Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
The fact is he's gone, chief, and so's our case.
You know you keep saying that.
Keep saying what?
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
What's the other name?
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
Can you get some sworn statements?
All right, all right.  Break it up.
Where you going, boss?
I did.
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
...Oswald?
No, I did not.
...ever called Dean Andrews?
No, I did not.
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
No, I did not.
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
What did they...
You still questioning any Cubans?
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
I believe the boys got a couple.
Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Dad, look what I drew.
Daddy!  Where have you been?
Are we going away, Daddy?
He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
How many shots you say you heard?
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
Aren't you being a little hard?
I'm sorry.
No.  Never heard of him.
A Perry Russo?
No.
Who?
No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
Hi.
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
They killed him, honey.
For sexual purposes?
Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.
One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
I'd say he was probably getting intelligence training.
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
Time?
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
Jim Garrison?
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
More than ten years.
And he never hit you before?
I don't know if I should talk about this.
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
She's the best damn witness we have!
They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?
If you must know, virtually nothing.
Yes?
Virginia or Elizabeth?
Six.
Yes.
Do you walk home?
Not a problem.
I know. That's why I went.
I understand.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
Won't forget?
Who was there for your ass?
You were there for me.
Who?
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
What?
I need a favor.
That requires me goin' out tonight?
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
Look, man, I know I owe you --
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
How'd you know where he was?
And you didn't tell the Police?
Great, you're here.
What's going on?
She sound scared?
She almost sounds scared.
What's she want?
She wants to go back to work.
My pocketbook.
What's in it?
What's this?
Take your time.
Help us do what?
But now you're telling us now you do.
You don't want much, do you?
How was your flight?
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
What's her name?
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
Are you really a bail bondsman?
I gave you my card there.
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
Can we stop for cigarettes?
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
I thought you might want a drink?
Is it dark?
That doesn't sound dark.
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
Ordell pick up his bond?
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
I didn't?
How many trips did you make?
With ten thousand? Nine.
If you're having some.
Thanks, but I have my own now.
What, I couldn't hear you?
Somebody loan it to you?
Want to hear some music?
This is pretty.
Uh-huh.
Who is this?
The Delfonics.
'76?
'74, I think.
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
How'd you find that out?
He told me last night.
He called you?
He came by.
What?... What'd you do?
You're gonna offer to set him up?
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
How do you feel about getting old?
You're not old. You look great.
My ass ain't the same.
Bigger?
Well, hello.
I walked right past you.
Catching a movie.
What'd ya see?
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
And Annette's it for you?
Who was your girl before Annette?
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
I'm old enough to be her father.
How old's Annette?
What're you, a bag lady?
I go back to work tomorrow.
You talk them into it?
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
Right around here, in the food court.
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
What about you Max?
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
That's my job.
And is that it?
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
It'll be more than that.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Where's the rest of it?
In the bag underneath.
Then you're out and you get nothing.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Set him up.
Tell him you want to see him?
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
Did you tell him you were leaving?
I didn't use you, Max.
I didn't say you did.
I never lied to you.
I know.
Where're you going?
Spain.
Madrid or Barcelona?
Thanks, but you have a good time.
Sure I can't twist your arm?
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
I thought you were tired of your business?
I'm just tired in general.
Who's side are you on?
What if I plead guilty?
Most of the times.
Sometimes every day, for a while.
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
Oh, Miss Brown?
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
What the fuck is that shit?
I know what it looks like.
We'll just be a minute.
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
You know what we want.
Oh, so now you know him?
He sells guns.
You talk to him?
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
I imagine shit needs to be done.
Not yet.
I'm sure that was the idea.
She told you that?
Uh-huh.
Was she there?
She didn't say.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
Yes. All those things are true.
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
You took the time to pay the saleswoman.
There was a guy with Melanie?
I have no idea.
You'd take a polygraph on it?
If it'll make you happy.
What about me?
Oh, hi.
Buy ya a beer?
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
Sure.
Uh-uh.
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
Beaumont Livingston?
You already knew that?
You think I'm kidding?
Jackie?
Hi, Melanie.
Are you getting that black suit?
Yeah, do you like it?
Do you got something for me?
I got some vodka in the freezer.
Got some o.j.?
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
They asked.
And what was your answer?
Beaumont Livingston.
Yeah?
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
What the hell you doin'?
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
I said, you understand what I'm saying
I understand woman, damn!
I got a problem...
The Cockatoo Inn.
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
How the fuck they know that?
You told em? You told em it's me?
They already know it's you.
A woman.
If you want.
No, I give it to someone else first.
That's the idea.
So we need two people, two women.
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
Managers get ten percent.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
I'll give ya ten.
Plus the same deal as before.
Uh-huh.
How do you know she did that?
I was there, I saw her do it.
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
Who's paging you?
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
It's boring, isn't it?
I can sit through it once.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
Want a hit?
When did you get out of jail?
Four days ago.
Where at?
Susanville.
How long?
Four years?
Uh-huh.
What for?
Bank robbery.
Is it ready to go?
Want a Metrix?
The roller disco one.
You're fourteen years old here?
Yeah.
No.
Where were you?
Detroit.
With Ordell?
Were you a disco guy?
No.
C'mon, don't lie.
I don't like dancing.
That's a picture of me in Japan.
You been to Japan?
You lived in Japan, when?
Wanna fuck?
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
Is it dead?
He killed a man worked for him the other night.
He went to meet that stewardess.
Please.
Uh-huh?
We're leaving now!
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
Lemme have the bag.
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
This one.
Thanks, Baby.
What's your cost?
As low as two.
I'm going to wait in the car.
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
Guess where I am?
You're outside?
Who was that?
That was Beaumont.
Who was Beaumont?
An employee I had to let go.
Sure.
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
I still don't understand why you keep her around.
Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge.
It's Louis.
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
So what, you left her there.
You shot Melanie?
Twice. In the parking lot.
Couldn't talk to her?
You know how she is.
You couldn't just hit her?
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
You shot her twice?
Uh-huh.
So you're sure she's dead.
Pretty sure.
Where did you shoot her?
Louis?
What?
Where's the rest of it?
How much it there?
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
How long was she in there?
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Then what?
We went to the parking lot.
Where you shot her.
Fuck you for asking me that.
What'd you shoot her with?
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
Jesus Christ.
How can I help you?
That's Winston. He works here.
Gonna have to put up cash.
Cost you a thousand for the bond.
What's his full name?
Beaumont Livingston.
Haven't a clue.
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
House or apartment?
Hey, Max.
I can see that. Why?
I got some more business for ya.
Somebody already did.
What?
You didn't hear?
Brown, Jackie Brown.
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
I got it. I just don't got it on me.
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
Where is it?
I thought you might be asleep.
I'm alone.
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
How'd you find me?
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
All I did was walk out with it.
And you did that to protect my interest?
My office.
And where's Jackie?
She's been there since Thursday night.
Have her bring the money here.
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
It's the next street.
I know where it is.
Turn left.
My money's in that office, right?
No.
You sure?
Yes.
Get that for me, will ya baby?
Who is it?
We're back.
Cherry Bail Bonds.
He ain't here right now.
He leave town?
He's around.
Give me his home number.
Get me out of here.
Where do you want to go?
Take me home.
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
What are you then?
I'm alive.
Then what are you doing here?
What isn't happening?
Dream on!
No, thanks.
I see.
What do you want?
Just to see you. That's all.
Well, how do I look?
Hello, Sam.
Are you all right?
Daddy!
Oh God!
You're hurting me!
Stop!!!!
Daddy. Let go.
What do you want from me?
You have an unusual hand.
It's short, huh?
Short? It's ended.
Hello.
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
Maybe there's a larger truth.
Maybe the demons are real.
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
I'm hanging up.
Hey, wait!
Daddy, what was that noise?
There was a bang.
It was the window.
It's cold.
Tell your mother.
Wait ... Daddy.
Now what?
Doctor.  Ph.D.
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
Why do you say that?
But the paper ...
What do you mean, demons?
How long had that been going on?
He say what they looked like?
... I've seen them, too.
Dr. Carlson's dead?
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
I saw Sarah the other day.
Her knee acting up?
A bit.
Who?
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
She hates me, Louis.
I can't relax.
Louis, you're a life saver.
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
What are you doing?
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
I'm walking, aren't I?
Jake, you need to rest.
Are you in the service?
It's good to see you.
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
No.  I see them.
Christ, I know how it sounds.
I don't know what to say.
I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.
Carlson? Is he new here?
What's your name?
What was that?
It's freezing.
She was good in bed, though.
Go to sleep.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
Jacob, what can I do?
My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.
They stole it.
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
Why didn't you turn on the light?
I didn't want to wake you.
Gee, thanks a lot.
I moved the couch. That's all.
That help?
What do you think?
What do you mean?
The room!
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
What happened to you?
You up?
No. Have you seen my glasses?
Where'd you leave 'em?
I don't know.
Did you look around the headboard?
Jezzie, I can't see.
Thanks.  What's that?
Your kid dropped it off.
Who? Jed?
No. The little one.
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
They're weird names.
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
Yeah, but for what?
A good lay.
And look what I got.
I must have been out of my head.
What?
What do you mean you can see?
Look at her face. A real bitch.
She looked good then.
I don't like things that make you cry.
Jake!
I'm going home.
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
'Cause she's always on your mind.
Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
They weren't human!
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Oh, come on. It's early.
We're at Della's.
What do you mean? Where do you think?
Where's Della? Bring her here?
Why? What for?
Show me Della!
Can't you stop it?
What does it say?
It's gone to the top.
How high is that?
What the hell are you doin'?
Get your clothes off.
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
He's coming right over.
That's your decision.
I can't do it.
Don't gimme that.
Lie down!
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
Sam, Tony, come in here.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
I love you, Jez.
I know.
While you were in the shower.
What? What do you mean?
He said you didn't have one.
It's just me.
Jezzie?
Who else were you expecting?
Stay away from me, Jez.
Don't!
It might be for me.
Are you out of your mind?
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
Me neither.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
Bullshit!
I promise.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
I love you when you're angry.
Sit down, Jake.
Where are they?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Where have they gone?
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
Why won't you answer me?
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
I don't know you.
I'm not upset.
Jake, what is it?
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
You can have anything you want.
Mid-town mostly.
Oh?  Where you going?
West.
Where's West? New Jersey?
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Sit down, Jake.
Where are they?
Where have they gone?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
One drop?
I think I'm falling asleep.
I can't move.
Just relax.
And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
Well that's good to know.
I would have stayed there if I could.
I no from around here.
They're awfully heavy.
How was Palm Springs?
Hot. Where do I sign?
He's burning up.
For what? For seeking the truth?
You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
Clear the area. This is an order!
Dream on!
He's burning up.
Total delirium.
He'll never make it.
Push 'em back.
I'll page him.
Call my chiropractor.
We're doing everything we can.
Where am I?
Lennox Hospital.
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
This is not a dream! This is my life.
Hello.
Jacob Singer?
Speaking.
Paul Gruneger!
Count 'em on one hand.
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
Still married, Jake?
Why the hell we drivin' here?
I just need to talk.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
What's goin' on Paul?
I don't know.
You in trouble?
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
I don't know what to do.
What do you mean?
I've seen them too ... the demons!
Oh God. I know. I know.
You come home with me.
Died?
A car accident.
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
How did it happen?
Do you want me to get someone?
I have some ice from the machine.
Bring it in.
Is he all right?
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
Watch it punk, I'm armed.
That's nine to four, geek-boy.
He's not part of the program.
Yes it does.
Okay, enough of this shit.
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
We're not leaving Crutch!
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
What are you doing?!!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
We can't lead him into the other hull!
His mother?
What?
Minimal.
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
Bomb?
Can't shut em' down from here.
Sergeant!
Uh-oh.
What?!
Where have you been?!!
Where the hell were you?!!
Creepy.
You see that?
Better let me.
Everyone okay?
The hull's imploding!
We're not supposed to do that.
I'll need system four converters.
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
Kay-Em!
Done!
Goodbye, my love.
Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
We'd need charges.
How many?
I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
Then what do we do?!
It bought us some time.
Earth II.
Get them in the lab!
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
What the hell are you doing?
Wait a minute...I need...
Yllo, what's your head count?
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
You just keep an eye out.
Sergeant!
I'm with you kid.
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
Kicker, anything?
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Where is everybody? What happened?
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Give me a break! What happened?
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
Pull me in!
Where are you going?
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
Med-kit?
What if you miss?
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
See? We're not so bad.
Got it.  You ever space walked?
You wanna release your air tanks?
Okay, good tip.
Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
Rizzo, pull away!
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
Spunky . . .
Well?
She needs a little time.
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
Yuck.
Go-go-go-go-go!!!!
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
Kaboom.
I...I don't know what I did...
You lost the charge?
They'll make it.
Close the fucking door!
Now that's just gross.
Now this is getting exciting.
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
This is what it means right here.
I'm gonna spew.
You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.
Hurry! She's lost it!
You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
You're so bossy.
You're quicker than usual.
Later.
Jesus!
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
What do we do?!!
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
I don't know...sorry?
Robot huh?
Kay-em 14.
Barbie from hell...
I'm surrounded by idiots.
Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
I didn't say I was good at it.
Am I in there?
It's just you and me, then.
Almost done.
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Sorry, sorry.
Who are you apologizing to?
Kay-em you okay?
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
I missed you too.
Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
Kicker!
Leave him behind!
What?
How do you know?
Something's wrong.
Then open the doors!
What?!!
I gotta go back.
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
I'm sending you the files.
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
But...I...400 years?
Azrael can you repeat that?
You're not going anywhere.
You wanna die?
What good will that do?
More soldiers?
Guys, please come with me!
It's okay, he just wanted his machete.
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
Hockey player? He's not a ...
Can we get through these?
Guys, he's right behind us!
Son! -- Out of the water now!
My boat's neat, dad!
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
My cars. And a comic book.
Did you bring a check?
You got it.
And incidental damages, if any...
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
This is Matt Hooper...
I know who he is...
What do you mean 'We...?'
Who's driving the boat?
Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?
What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
I never saw one that big.
Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.
C'mon. Middle appendix --
What's that one, there?
Where...?
That's it! Radio in for help!
Shut up! Just pump her out!
Did you get him in the head?
What about us?
He's trying to sink us!
He's chasing us! I don't believe it.
He's comin' up -- !
Right.
Do you see the kids?
Probably out in the back yard.
Like you're from N'Yawk. 
I never hear the whistle.
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
Sexy, hm? What was I before?
Be careful.
Love ya.
You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
Can you stand something to eat?
Mikey loves his birthday present.
Where is he?
It's three feet deep, Martin
You too, sweetheart...
Home... New York?
Colorful, isn't he?
You going to be all right?
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
What'll I tell the kids?
Only 24 hours!
Got a pen on you?
My kids were on that beach...
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Who are you?
Dynamite!  How was your day...?
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
What stinks so bad?
How can you tell?
Florida license plate.
...Nothing.
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
Why don't we just tow it in?
I hope we get some more help.
This has got to be one big violation...
What's that, a ship?
What the hell?
Think the tide's with us?
Just keep kicking.
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
You picked her up on the ferry.
I didn't know her.
And nobody else saw her in the water?
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
You here for the summer?
Some friends and me took a house.
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream.
We're not even sure what it was.
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
You wanna call it a night after here?
It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
Leg of lamb this time?
Look at him take it!
Do I set the goddam hook?
Would you like something? Some coffee?
My husband tells me you're in sharks.
You're leaving?
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
He's busy.
Transplants?
Let it go, don't waste your time.
I'm okay...
Over there!
20 feet, if it's an inch...
Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
Easy! It'll tear right out!
He's heading under -- !
Follow him!
Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
I don't think so.
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
Thanks for the message.
You know how I feel about her.
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
Hey Bleek.
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
I don't know...
I'm supposed to be running.
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
Whose idea was it?
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
But you copy my work every week.
Charisma?
Okay, cool.
Jesus, Bleek.
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
We could get back together too.
You're being really immature.
Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
I still have your virginity!
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
Wait, let me take that.
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
Can we make out now?
Hey man.
Oh, hey Vijay.
Yup.
Did you hear it's yours?
Yup.
I don't really know anything about it.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
No... I guess not.
What is your job title, exactly?
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
I have no idea how to spit this out.
But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend.
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
You don't know anything about me!
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
I'm a junior.
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
Viscera?
Blood and guts.
What do you play?
I rock a Harmony.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
Your guitar is named Kimber?
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
Why aren't you at work?
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
No, more commercial stuff.
Commercials.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
Junk?
You know... it's parts...
I know what junk is.
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
That suits you.
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
Oh really? What's the verdict?
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
Wow. That shirt is working hard.
Is Vanessa here?
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
What?
I actually know this one.
Oh, okay. Like this.
You've never been to a dance, have you?
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
What are you?
I'm leaving Vanessa.
No.
Uh, hi Su-Chin.
You should try Adderall.
I heard that was you.
Can I take your coats?
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.
Nothing...
Then what's going on?
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
Juno? What's going on?
Hi. I'm here for the big show?
Your name, please?
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
You mean like couples?
Please stop now.
Or...
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
I am a suicide risk.
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
Only the one in my pants.
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
The Penny Saver sucks.
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
Hly shht!
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
Keith's hot.
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
What do you make with that?
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
You guys are playing music?
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
Hm.
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
What would be a good time for you?
Like what? Be a rock star?
We're actually, finally doing this?
Looks like it, yeah.
Yeah, downtown.
A hotel?
It's a loft.
You lose!
Hi, I'm Adele.
...I said, I like your hair.
Are you takin' the pictures?
...Yeah.
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
What's this?
It's a portfolio of my work.
You took this picture?
That's me.
No it is not!
Do what?
Adele... are you serious?
Carryin' a gun.
...That's not true.
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
What if they're dangerous?
Geez, they look kinda weird.
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
Yeah but, what is it?
What's your name, boy?
Vernon, Florida.
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
...Mind if I hold that Bible?
Tight fit.
You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
Can't hurt.
How much do I owe you?
Who?
That bad?
Dahlia, no.
Yeah.
Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
If you say so.
You two been busy in here.
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.
So how's it going?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
What did he sound like on the phone?
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
Up yours.
All set?
Fuck!
What is it?
Brian I want him out of our car!
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
Carrie, watch for Early.
What about you?
Not yet.
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
Bri'.
...Need a hand with those bags?
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
...never?
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
What is it?
What happened?
Who are you?
Could be.
What about the owner of the house...  ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?
...Diebold?
...That'd be my guess.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
How old you?
Umm. Altogether?
Yes. Altogether.
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
Yes.
With how many people?
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
Shit.
What do you think?
Oh shit. How long did it take?
Did what take?
You know what else?
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
What do you want?
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
You wanna go to Paul's house?
You think?
Probably.
He lives on 76th?
78th.
Telly.
Yeah.
You thirsty?
You got any money?
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
You down with the boost?
Man, this guy is really good.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
Who?
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
I don't understand why you do that.
Why I do what?
That.
Why I give pennies?
So really, it's good luck.
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
How much you gonna take?
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
Nah.
Casper! Was up kid?
Nothen' B.
Where you at?
Right here.
Where you goin' tonight?
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
You goin'?
Na.
Man we fucked him up.
Sup then? Sup?
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
Right now?
Yeah. Come on.
Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps.
Yeah. After I saw you last week.
At the block party?
I thought you had a girlfriend.
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Do you like kissing me?
I'm nervous.
How do you know?
I just know. I know you'll love it.
I don't want you to hurt me.
Do you care about me?
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
No...
What do I want to do?
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
Do you care about me?
Dance!
What?
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
Telly is at Steven's?
How old are you?
One.
I tested positive?
You're OK?
Miss, would I be prying?
Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Hello.
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
You are being ripped open.
I know.
Did you bleed?
I didn't bleed.
Passion...
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
Wish me luck.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
I was like yes! I'm going out with him!
And you don't get shit out of it.
Making love is like.
Yeah.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
He still does.
Yeah?
You've heard the stories right?
So that's why Casper is how he is.
Yep.
No. I was just kidding.
Hi mom.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
When are you gonna be back?
Not too late.
Four-thirty in the morning?
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
Hello?
It's me. Telly.
Hello?
You want a wip-it?
So, how many people live here now?
I don't know, eight or nine.
Slow.
Yeah.
It was... it was.
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
By yourself?
We seem to have a little problem here?
Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
You are!  I don't like you.
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
Morpheus.
We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
The door was open.
What do you want?
You got it on the board.
No, I need the original note.
He's not talking about himself.
Then let's narrow it down.
I'm positive.
Yes you are.
The message!  I figured out--
We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
Take it easy.  Both of you.
Sorry.
What is it?
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
A few people.
What do you mean, stand out?
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
Don't fuck with us!  Where did you go!
Hello, Peter.
Hello, Peter.
Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
To get your attention.
Did you know her?
Where is she?
You know her?
Not really.
Why her?
Because she's the type.
Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
Have you any idea what the message is?
What makes you think I was there?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
What word did you leave last night?
Hello, Peter.
You sonofabitch!
By that time the game will be over.
Please... wait.
The game's over.  You lost.
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
Very good.  How did you know?
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
There's three.  The first is 1983. Lionel Baines.  The Boston...
What is it?
They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
It worked out alright, didn't it?
Feeling better?
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
Why did he?
Why did he what?
Come here.
You must be Erica.
Uh huh.
Do you like my dad?
I know he really likes you.
Okay.  Nice meeting you.
What are you doing up?
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
That has nothing to do with it.
What is it, dad?
You ready?
I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.
It isn't Kathy.
How long has she been dead?
Six, eight hours tops.
No prints.
You mean, no prints but hers?
Same as the others?
Yeah.
How long she been dead?
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
We're not sure.
I'm busy right now.
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
What time did he get there?
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
The most logical choice.
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
Do you know how she found the apartment?
Could you tell me where you were last night?
You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.
Another one?  What word did he leave?
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
Where were you last night?
Answer the question.
Jeremy would have never killed himself.
Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell.
He knows you're aware of that.
It's a good play, but risky.
You have something you want to say?
About what?
Whatever's on your mind.
What do you see here?
Mate in five.
No.
Feel like practicing?
Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
Are you with the tournament?
Uh huh.
When I was very young.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
It is.
Do you always open quickly?
Well, I think I've had enough.
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
She could be dead after the game.
You sure you don't want to eat something?
You sound like my mother.
Another kind of game?
In a way.
Of course.
Do you?
Of course.
Why?
No.
I know it was bad.
I know you didn't
Doesn't that scare you?
No.
Why?
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
Wasn't I just talking about me?
No.  You were talking about chess.
Alright.  What about me?
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
She died in a car accident.
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
I'm not playing a game now.
Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
I just don't want to fight with you.
You've got to face the things you feel.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
You.
Did you call?
They're not delivering.  I'm going to go pick up the pizza.
I thought you said the line was busy?
I tried again and got through.
What's wrong?
For emphasis?
What?
Hi.
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
But I do.
Why?
This letter.  I've never opened it.
Why not?
Because I know what it says.
It could be anything.
How did you know it was "carefully"?
You're right.  The killer told me.
You're going to be late for your match.
Are you going to come tonight?
You beat him.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
<u>What</u>?
We're almost married.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
Thank you, but I can wait.
I lied.
About what?
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
Lyssa ...
Colwyn ...
I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
I know it.
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
You must move away from the Center.
I don't know how.
Take the western passage.
In the Arctic ice.
That's a better one.
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
You will go alone.
The White Castle has fallen.
Does the Queen live?
The new Queen lives.
There is no other way.
There is nothing.
Reach out farther. Call to her.
You have not slept in two days.
I can't reach her.
What do you see?
<u>Why</u>?
I'm not sure.
But you suspect.
Yes.
He has come for Lyssa.
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
She must make a glaive.
The spiral begins in the west.
I chose the wrong passage.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
No! You cannot know that!
I can. Because I choose it.
Slayers!
Do not let the waters touch you.
They can be saddled.
You have done it?
It is today?
Each to his fate.
Yes.
Even by you?
You too are lonely.
I ache with it.
Let me comfort you.
I cannot take comfort when she has none.
You will not, then?
What business?
Once is enough, thank you.
My <u>friend</u>.
You and I will guard the fire.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
Hah! You don't know me, boy.
To the place where Death lives.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
I'm not hungry.
Not sleepy, either?
You've eaten nothing.
Hand over your dinner.
Go. I command you.
We could reach it on fire-mares.
Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
Where are you going?
We'll meet you at the inn.
Can't I come, too?
No.
Sugarballs?
I have a cinnamon bar.
You do?
I'm hungry.
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
I only want one.
Would you desert your friends?
But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy.
Put me down, you lout!
What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
And do you think I live on air?
Oh, my poor stew!
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
They'll trample him to death!
He will not!
He will come for me.
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
A match for your son, I think.
You were attacked in the forest?
Yes. We lost five.
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
We seek the Fortress of Krull.
The new King.
It is the time.
Can you see?
Knowledge I wouldn't want.
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
The Widow of the Web?
She has the power of vision.
Her name is Death.
Few have survived it.
I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
Who speaks that name!
I was beautiful then.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
No, she was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?
We had no children.
You had a son.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
Do not try your trickery on me!
You see?
What's that man's name?
Give me his name, I will mail him.
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
...You moved too, didn't you?
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
Take...
OK, I'm fine.
Huh... 500 meters?
Wow! It's brilliant!
OK.
The yellow and pink.
Come on, get down!
Mathilda? May I come in?
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
Not taken.
Why?
...I'm going to kiss you.
When I say I love you.
What shall we do?
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
It's too big.
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
...No...
How many girlfriends did you have?
...I don't know.
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
Yes.
I don't know... Five minutes.
How shall we get out now, Leon?
Yes?
...I got lost, Mister.
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
Don't fear.
How are you, Miss?
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
...Composer.
Huh, that's good!
Huh?
You can't sit here like that.
...And how much is it?
Can I sit on the stairways now?
...Who sent you?
Is he still alive?
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
Do you recognize him?
He probably just went somewhere.
What is it?
This smells good.
Why am I such an authority?
I have new dreams now.
It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
What if you don't make it?
Are you two planning kids?
I have to finish first.
What would you like us to do?
How long does this... Mania last?
This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.
So what's the deal Maurice?
I know what you're getting at.
You do?
I've seen it before.
You thought I sent them?
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?
What?
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
What it is -- is the truth.
Yes.
You're talking to me?
No.
Then why?
Show me.
Walk with me?
I thought we both wanted the same things.
I've changed my mind.
I want children.
Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --
It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken.
Your father?
He's plastered.
Where?
Maurice?
The beach of Pacifica, California.
If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
To where?
Pacifica, California.
From where?
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Doubts?  About what?
Shit!  He jumped!
Well, hello.
Each inch represents 150 miles...
What was that?
This story is big huh?
Mammoth.
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
Yes.
When are you leaving?
I'm walking there Kris.
Walking where?
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
You're walking to California?
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
She knew you loved her.
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
What Mr. Parker?
Tom Joad?
I missed you Kris.
Are they standing?
Where am I?
In a hospital.
You're in pain.
Good morning.
Is it a boy or a girl?
Hello, Mr. Parker.
Hello.
What's your shoe size?
I really want that watch.
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
What do you want?
What are my choices?
What do you think I should get?
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
...Noooo.
Orange soda?
No.
Coffee?
No.
Sparkling apple cider?
No.
Water?
Hello!
Hello.
We can go to one if you'd prefer.
I guess I do too.
You what?
Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
Mind if I use the bathroom?
Want a drink? I'm having one.
Do you want to fuck now?
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
To death?
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
If I was I'm sorry.
This is the home of an angel.
You OK out there?
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
Thank you. What time is it?
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
Don't you like me, Ben?
Ben?
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
Can we just forget it?
I don't understand any of that.
Please!
Yes... I'll give you that.
Do you want me not to go tonight?
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
I like it here with you.
Let's stay for a while.
There are limits.
How much, do you think?
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
Where are you staying?
Right here at the hotel. Why?
You have been lonely?
Where have you been staying?
It is, after all, Sera, my money.
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
Yes? What?
Yuri... are you...
Harvard Law School?
That's right.
What alibi?
I can't tell you.
Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi.
Were you with another man?
Go to hell.
I'll take that as a no.
Are we done for today?
Get up.
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
He's an ass that's gonna try.
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
It's so shameful...
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
What's going on?
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
Did you hear a shot fired?
Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
Dewey Newcomb?
Who's askin'?
Huh?
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
Good work today, Ms. Woods.
Sit down.
Thank you.
You're hitting on me?
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
So everything you just said --
You're not going up there.
Was she carrying a weapon?
Why didn't you call me?
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03.
Yes?
I think so...
-- his life?
You can't even imagine.
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
You ready?
God, that felt great!
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
I'm so happy for you!
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
Licensed attorney or family member?
Uh -- family.
Relation?
I'm her sister.
Name?
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
Our group is full.
I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique.
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
It's not my alibi to tell --
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
You almost had me fooled.
I'm a bitch.
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
We still love you. Sisters forever!
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
Here. You're gonna need this.
Power yoga?
Picking out my wedding dress!
What?!
Josh proposed!
Hello! You're like, a lawyer.
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
You have Stromwell.
Good luck.
Don't ask.
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
Aside from that.
She's completely untrustworthy.
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
But maybe it's not what you think.
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
And you know this for a fact?
In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
Projecting joy is not my job.
You really think I'm attractive?
He's gay! Enrique is gay!
Back up. How do you know he's gay?
Hey --
Oh, my God!
Is he the only one?
No -- it's just -- not me.
I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
Oh, he is so over on this campus.
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
What?
I got bangs!
I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.
Neither.
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
I don't know --
His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
You don't really believe she's innocent?
Class schedule, map, book list.
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
Your what?
You're beautiful.
That's not entirely --
Then what? My boobs are too big?
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
You go where?
Harvard. Law school.
You got into Harvard Law?
Good. Good.
Wow. You're a walking felony.
Thank you. Having fun?
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
You look -- nice.
Pink ones.
In court. On opposing sides.
Are you serious?
Yes.
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
Three months.
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
Why do you say that?
Elle?
Is it a Kappa?
There he is!
Why so few?
Then we smash 'em?
You go?  Not watch fun?
Fire moat... why do that?
We watch... good fun...
You go to lady now?
My generosity is not so large as that.
What do you want with me?
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
But I'm hideous!
You're magnificent.
God protect me.
Not from me, surely...
And you... are you not also afraid?
I am afraid of nothing.
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
Why have you brought me here?
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
What do you want from me?
And then?
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
I didn't know... I --
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
Flozen foleva not good.
Faerie ring?
It's bluebells!
Damnation!  Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters!  You've bested me, Jack.
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
You be our guest, Jack.
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.
Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
But... but, why?
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
And who might that be?
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
What is it?
Pregnant, is she?
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
We must follow that bird.
How do we follow a raven we can't even see?
This is ogre's magic.
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
Worse than the battlefield.
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
Twould appear other travelers precede us.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
My God!  Look!
Something the matter?
Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
I should hope not!
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
God's blessing.
What make ye of that, Jack?
Wait!
Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
Wait, Jack.
Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.
Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
Can we trust him?
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
Give in to despair and all is lost.
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
That be so, better you pinch yourself now, Jack.
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
There isn't much time!
Been telling you that all along, lad.
One more turn...
Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
Aye.  We're good as inside.
It doesn't matter.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
Sunlight, you say?
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Mean you to seek him out below?
What weapon?
Will you explain what's going on?
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
He'll not escape me.
A good day for singing...
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
I was with the Princess.
By the pond.  She was teasing me.
Barely living, from the looks of it.
We seek to undo the curse.
Well done, lad.
Look at that shot!  Three at once! I can't miss!
Sweet slippers of Oisin!
How're these?
Dolt!
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
These for me?
You promised!
Never.
But you did... you did!
Liar!
Blackheart.  Aptly named.
A promise is a sacred oath.
Stop complaining.
What shall we do?
Oh, dear.
How much longer?
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
Are you honest?
He'll not flee if I show myself?
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
Where are you going?
Who?
They tricked you.
My own father...
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
He did run?
I don't want it on me.
Tis not fit for a princess.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
I have no wife.
Then, perchance you'll me.
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
Lili!  No!
What have I done?
I thought you were dead... I --
I was bewitched... it's better this way...
No!  I won't let it happen...
What?
Sunlight... It destroys him.
That's why he goes masked during the day...
So, he's hiding in the dark...
In the dark... where I join him...
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
Lili... I love you!
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
Pinching me!
Pinching?  Where?
Everywhere!  Ow!
Step lively now!
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
Ask away, sweet man.
What became of the princess?
Exceeding fair.
She's dead!
Dead, dead, dead.
Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.
Courage, Jack.
Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
I'd be honored.
Only that?
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
Do I not please you, Jack?
In every way.
And am I not fair?
That was in jest.
Jest with me then.
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
You... you... you mortal you!
What do we do now?
What's she doing?
I'm in your debt, Screwball.
Praise be to God.
What care the bones when the soul is free?
Sorry, Jack.
How came you by this blade?
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
You're with us in battle.
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...
Can you show us the way?
You've been inside?
Marco!
What are you doing?
Are you going to see Sam again?
He's not there.
He's here.  Check the bathroom.
What's that for?
Mom said I should.
Oh.
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
He hasn't called?
Do you guys feel like painting?
What color?
Mom?
I put him to work.
I couldn't get it to go down.
And why was the alarm on?
You'd better call and cancel.
What are you doing up so early?
Why?  What do you mean?
I'm going to bed.
Atonement.
Sorry I got you into trouble.
He must.
He seems lonely.
Are you his friend?
No.
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
Don't you have school?
What's today?
My keys.
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
You're a good girl.
You have to ask like that?
My mother would die.
It's not what I was expecting.
What did you think it would be?
Hey.
Where to?
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
You should stay.
I don't know.
Where's your dad?
He jumped into the ocean.
He's a freak.
You look better without make-up.
I might not stay, anyway.
I'll get your back.
Why?
Huh?
I can use your mom's.
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
I'm coming in.
I don't want you to!
We're not gonna do anything.
Why are you so stupid?
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
What's the point of this?
What are you talking about?
Josh said...
I thought I was helping you.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
On the handlebars or your shoulders?
You'd hate him for the trick.
Where are you?!
Floating to Catalina.
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
He's at work while I'm here.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
He won't leave my room.
And of course the Beck's, with the...
It could have been a squirt gun.
Are you guys' friends?
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
Mr. Stevens?
A violation?
Oh, yes.
And if I enclosed it?
A sink?
I hate to ask about a window.
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
That would take weeks.
I'm good, thanks.
What are you on?
Pardon me?
how much weight have you lost?
Right...she married...what was he?
He buys and sells the world.
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
I've been here twenty years.
Maybe that's too long.
Maybe...?
Oh.
How old are you?
Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you were there.
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
Well, I feel better about this now.
I've got one favor to ask.
Well, it's the least I can do.
Is Alyssa home?
She's out with a friend.
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
She didn't really say.
Sam?
Uh huh.
I didn't recognize you!
Thanks for the shower.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
Thank you.
You're here early today.
Is Alyssa here?
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
George, this is the third time.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
I forgot where I put my keys.
The whole summer, man.  Party in Tahoe.
I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
Why would you be there?
Because I live there.
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
I'm not going!
I'm not going!
You don't have a choice.
Are you totally insane?!
Probably in the bible.
What are you doing?!
I warned you yesterday.
I hate turkey.
Why?
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
You'll have money when you work.
No one would blame me if I left!
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
I'm not doing it!
I'm leaving.
Where are you going?
I don't know.
When are you going to be back?
I don't know.
Where is it?
A friend of yours is here.
Did you got through my pants?
You're too fucking late.
The gloves on the table are for you.
You can't make me do a thing.
Sit down for a second.
Hi, Alyssa.
I took some of your Vicodin.
I know the feeling.
How do you become something you're not?
What would you like to be?
What are you now?
Nothing.
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
I know parts of who you are.
I wish you had told me then.
What would you be doing now?
Getting high, I guess.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
Sun glasses?
To hide a black eye.
I loved him too much.
She seemed upset.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
And you told Mom today?
I don't wanna go, Sam.
I'd eat a lot of red meat.
What would you do?
What kind of house?
Can you build a house in four months?
Good for you.
Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty.
Thanks for telling me.
Ah!  Oh....
I need you to do me a favor.
God, you look like crap, George.
Oh.  Sorry.
She needs to be alone, I think.
She's a little sad, is all.
You should lock your doors.
Lock the door behind you.
Where is he?
What are you doing?
I called everyone, everywhere!  You just vanished!  You could be dead!
Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today.
A blueprint spool.
Four days.  I left to think.
What did you do with your dog?
Kurt's been feeding him.
I need to talk to you.
Why would they tow your truck?
I was parked in day parking.
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
I love those doors.
Where will you live?
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
One of you would end up dead.
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
I want him with me.
Hey, hey!
I don't have a phone.
I drove over and you were gone.
I can't leave the house?
Last time you were gone for a week!
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
No.  I was going to let you do that.
I did say he could go.
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
What?
But you hated four out of the five you did.
Which?
It's not breakfast yet.
I dreamed about your house last night.
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
Go in there and lick his attitude.
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
With your hands or your tongue?
I'll find something that won't kill them.
Do you need help?
It's been a while.
I smiled at him.
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
I thought we were helping.
That was the truth.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
I'm married.
You bit my finger.
Is your back still killing you?
Peter left me yesterday.
What did he say?
Back.  Neck.  Back.
I could die.
Are you going to kiss me?
I better get the kids home.
Been thinking?
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
Does Alyssa know?
Nothing.
You got any weed?
What's your deal with Alyssa?
He said he heard hammering.
His father is a man.
We've eaten.
Should I?
If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
To shave your chest?
The biggest waste of time since television.
I can't go right now.
I was talking about our marriage.
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
You never really trusted me.
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
Despite you.
I never asked for more.
That's the problem.
Where are the kids?
You don't look like you.
Hey.
Hey.
You got a dog?
I've missed you guys.
What are you doing in my room?
Can you stay for dinner?
The door was open.
I don't know what I'm doing.
You could keep it and rent it out?
Queer.
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
Adam, that's not true!
Nothing R, okay?
Go tell your father we're eating.
Dad's home, already?
Nagger?
No, nigger.
Nigger.
A night in the hole?
Is Mae Rose okay?
She's doing just fine.
And the baby?
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
It's 1945. It's a different world now.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
Is Spanky here?
No, but...
She's alright, isn't she?
Why not?
She got married last month.
She always said that if you were on the outside...
Take care of me?
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.
You know I trust you, Claude.
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.
Sure, boss.
I got it... boss.
Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks!
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?
Come on, honey, let's get out of here.
I've never seen you in here before.
That's because I've never been here before.
Can't you remember your own name?
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
Don't I know you?
I don't think so.
Where they taking us, anyway?
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
What?
A loan officer?
How would I get a loan, anyway?
You need collateral.
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
My daddy gave me this watch.
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
You're soft.
I said you're soft.
Alright. You want some pie?
Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?
Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.
Here I am.
Guess we better get going, huh?
I think he's hurt pretty bad.
It ain't here.
Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
So?
What does that mean?
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
What's up, Ray?
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
You still got that map?
What'd you say?
You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
Come on, Ray, time to go!
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
The hell you talking about? What train?
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
I don't know. Who do you want?
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
It's a pardon from the governor.
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
Well, if that's the way it is...
That's the way it is.
You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
What the hell are you doing?
Damn, it was getting hot in there.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
Go where, Ray?
No, I'm gonna kill him --
I can't do it.
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
What'd you say?
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
I can't eat this.
You didn't get ketchup?
Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?
So?
Yeah? You and what army?
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
I know you're not talking to me...
How you doin'?
I'm all right.
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
You got your own nightclub?
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
Made just for you, Cookie.
How about some steak sauce?
Why ain't his pick swinging?
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
All in, boss!
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
Where am I at, man?
Hey, the dude's holdin'.
That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story.  Nigger, you crying?
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
Just like Elvis.
Mama?
Is everyone here?
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
Wait for the firemen!
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
Lemonade?
He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
Something like that, yes.
I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.
Jenny?
Appreciate it.
Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
What's your name?
Me? Willie Long.
What are you in for, Willie?
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
What's the Boom Boom Room?
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
How you doing? We're looking for Slim.
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
ADRIAN!
You shouldn't have come here.
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
Let her go.
Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
And he's dead serious.
That's what I thought!
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
We could create our own hell there.
...their damned souls will be ours.
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
Hello, Cassius.
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
No!
It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
Urr... uggg... errr...
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
My mom wasn't a goat?
How come you're not older?
Valerie's crying!
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
Where is he? He's late.
It's not me, moron.
Makin' friends already.
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
I didn't murder anybody
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
Knock, knock.
Check one-two. Check one-two.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
You're a good devil, Dad.
This is bad, Nicky.
So go get 'em, Dad!
That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
Coulda been much worse.
Hey.
That's a pretty brassiere.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Bus?
What was it called, sir.
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
Easy, Liberace.
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
What's with that guy?
Should we wake him up?
Did you check out the dragon mouth?
Look who's back from the dead.
You sure you're down with this?
Looking for the chief.
Schnapps...
Which way did he go?
Come on. One more time.
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
So I followed him...
Yes, great movie...
Please. You got to.
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
Good idea... kill me.
You gotta kill yourself.
Hello.
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
You got the wrong window again, man.
The South.
My dad's an optometrist.
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
"Octopus people?"
Sometimes, sure.
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
Valerie?
Are you dead?
What are you doing?
I think I'm floating.
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
We're going to Jersey?
Don't do it.
Nicky!
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
Do me.
I love you.
Why is that funny?
I don't know.
See something you like, my man?
You callin' me a thief, my man?
Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
All right -- what are you?
Where do you think we came from?
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
Where do you send them?
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
That's better.  How do you want us?
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
How do you want us?
I am.
Do you have anything special in mind?
Had enough?
Why?
You missed something special.
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
What the hell took you so long?
Of course.
I'm fine...  See you...
What's going on, Logan?!
It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
What's your name?
I'm Mary 2.
Where do you live, Mary?
Here.
Why aren't you in Nursery?
I'm very smart.
When do you go up?
No.  Just no.
You prefer women?
No.
Yes... probably he was renewed?
He was killed.
Killed? Why do you use that word?
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
Jessica.
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
No.
Later.
But you put yourself on the circuit!
And now?
Curious.
About what?
Not about that.
I'm listening.
I'm afraid to tell you.
I'm not armed.  Well?
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
Are you a 5 or a 6? 
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
Maybe... sure...
Thanks... but I have the choice.
Of course.
Why show me?
I'm going to run.
Why tell me?
You know something.
About running, dying what?
It's different now. Help me.
Where did you get that?
A Runner gave it to me.
And then you killed him, right?
I let him go... believe me.
I don't have much time.
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
Are you here to help me?
What're you going to do?
I wish I could help you.
Maybe you'll think of something...
Of course --
If you trusted me, you'd know.
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
I'd rather be with you.
Some people say children need human mothering.
Uh-uh.
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
Will you take me with you?
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
I hate outside! I hate it!
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
I doubt it.
Don't ever let go.
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
What does it mean?
You know, Jessica.
...But I still have the choice...?
Of course.
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
We can't. We're going back.
Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
Beloved husband...
Yes...
Are you sure?
What kind of jewel is this?
What belongs to the people?
All this. All of it.
What people?
I'll make the arrangements.
Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...
Come with us.
Goodbye.
Hello, Sandman.
How long have you been living here?
For as long as I can remember.
What kind of place is this?
How did you get here?
I have always been here...
Are there any other humans?
But there may be a few around somewhere.
What makes you think so?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Where are they?
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.
Not yet.
More... many more.
Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?
Stay? They lived together all their years?
Yes...
Can you make it back?
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
Well? How do you like it?
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
You're not contagious are you?
I don't think so.
Just goin' up'ta "Tops"... Maybe the "Ten Pin".
Sheila'll be at "Tops".
Sure, what's wrong with that?
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
You want somethin'?
What's happenin'?
They're comin' with us.
You okay, man?
What?
Pete... You okay?
You're a musician?
I like to remember things my own way.
What do you mean by that?
Very strange.
Do you own a video camera?
No.
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
How'd the camera get so high like that?
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Might be a good time to try using it again.
We'll keep a watch on the house.
As best we can.
You recognize that guy?
What a fuckin' job.
His or ours?
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
You know what I think?
I was here yesterday.
I don't know.
I want more.
Me, too.
Hello.
It's me...
Pete?
Me, too.
He'll kill us.
Are you positive he knows?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
So what do we do?
I don't know.
We should stop seeing each other.
Have you partied with him?
What deal?
He works for Mr. Eddy.
What's he do?
Pete... Don't...
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
Are you my man?
You got him.
You all right?
We killed him.
You killed him.
Where's the bathroom?
Dick Laurent?
Yes, I believe so.
I don't. I don't know him.
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
Hey.
You don't look so good.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
The police called us.
Please tell me.
The wife killer?
His condition? What do you mean?
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
Where's Pete?
Out in back.
You talk to him?
We saw you that night, Pete.
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
Where is he now?
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
One of the guards must have leaked it.
You just gonna let him go?
That's not Fred Madison?
No, sir, it's not.
Who is it?
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
What about yesterday?
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
Do you remember?
What's the matter?
We know that.
Who is it?
What is this, Rogoff?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
What's your axe?
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
Something wrong?
At your house. Don't you remember?
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
At your house.
Where's Alice?
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
What are you going to do?
I like to laugh, Fred.
That's why I married you.
What's that?
A videotape.
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
When you didn't come to the club.
I called, you know.
Don't you want to watch it?
We've got to call the police.
So?
We will.
What the hell is going on?!
What was that?!!!
Where would you feel safe?
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
What job?
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
I told you to stay in the car!
Was there?
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
Give that a try.
You like pornos?
Pornos?
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
Suit yourself, champ.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
It'll be ready.
How ya doin', Pete?
Hello.
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
Mr. Eddy?
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
At your house. Don't you remember?
No. No, I don't.
I missed you.
Yeah?...
What are you guys doin'?
You want some company?
Why haven't you called me?
What night?
Last time I saw you.
I don't remember... What happened that night?
You still care about me?
What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
You really don't remember?
It was weird...
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
What do you want?
I don't know.
I was?
Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?
Hey... Sheila.
What's the BITCH'S name?!
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Sheila... Stop...
Cable from Gainsford.
All of it?
Fossils, huh?
I'm a paleontologist.
A what?
A paleontologist.
Well, what do you know about that!
Found in Asia!
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
Okay, brother.
Don't call me brother.
Good morning, Lovey.
I beg your pardon.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
I see.
I see.
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
Is it?
It certainly is.
Oh, really?
Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?
Yes!
Something tells me this means food. Come on!
Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
I'm thinking.
No kidding?
Yeah. You know.
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
There you are!
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
They were in a quandary, and
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
Well, that's that, I guess.
What are we going to do?
Chalmers Bryant!
Think of it! In times like these.
Huh?
Hey, what's happened to you?
Nothing. Why?
Cave, eh? Where?
Hey - look!
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
Goodness, no!
So there are others?
Oh, yes.
For a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.
There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.
Oh, good heavens, no!
They were.
Well, it must have taken
108 and still active?
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Shall we have another?
Charming, isn't she?
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
No porters here!!
What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?
Oh, immediately.
Then it's done.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
Are you so certain you are away from it?
The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
It's astonishing - and incredible, but
Sondra Bizet.
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
Yes.
The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.
Bob, these are all that are left.
What are these people?
What is it? Has he fainted?
He's dead.
What is it?
See that spot?
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
What are you talking about?
Did I say "if"?
That's what you said.
Nothing about the porters yet?
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
George, what do you think you're doing?
George, come back!
Let me up! Let me up!
What about the porters?
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
You can't leave, George.
Why not? What's going to stop me?
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
Maria?
Yes, the little Russian girl.
What's she got to do with it?
Yes.
The clothes?
Yes, everything!
What was that?
Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
Where did you come from?
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
Good.
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
I guess we're in for it.
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
My name's Sondra.
I saw a man whose life was empty.
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
I'd love it!
Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
What do you want him to do?
Why, he's speaking English.
That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. Conway, I don't like that man. He's too vague.
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
You'll wait till you rot!
EXCUSE ME
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
All right, I'll be there.
The hell happened?
You shot an eight year old girl.
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
...touch that.
What the hell...
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
I guess I lost:
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
And Goodwill Toward Man?
No. just peace on Earth.
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
Only the damn guy won't know it.
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
Helluva night, isn't it?
What?  Who the hell are you?
Vayanse. You others, go on.
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
I know, but we're on a college campus...
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
I taught kindergarten.
Ha ha.  No, really.
You don't know me at all.
Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
Something's wrong here.
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
And what's this ... ?
Looks like a train ticket.
You think that's what's-happening?
Jesus...
Jesus Christ...
Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
Oh, yeah?  Fill us in, why don't you.
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
It's marble.
Would you call this a code 100?
Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!
You were saying?
After I got the shit beat out of me!
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
You coulda told me what you were doing.
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
I'm just wondering what's so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it?
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
Why not?
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
What do we do?
What the hell does that mean?
What are you doing?
They respond to fear, right?
The kid looked desperate.  I figured...
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown.
Noon exactly.
Did he say where?
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
How'd you know that?  Kay?
Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
Really nice wheels, by the way.
How's Dee?
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
Kay?  What's your 20?
He's gone, too.
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
They're gone.
I'm getting a trajectory...
And they're buying it?
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
Did it leave?
Actually, I don't know...
Wally!
Is it now?
What?
They're inside.
Take it.
Forget that guy --
No.  Follow him.
He'll turn around.
Agatha...
He's here.
Oh, God...
Where are we going?
Someplace safe.
I have to go back.
Agatha, you're never going back there.
Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
She died?
She grew up.
What --
Then who was he?
Found?  Where?
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
Because I found out about her...
About who?
And replace them with new ones.
That's not much.
You don't remember me, do you?
I put you away --
Yes, you did.
How do I find the --
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
Kill type?
That's an old one.  One of our first.
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
Hence the expression...
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
Tell me not to worry, John.
Don't worry, Lamar.
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
I understand.  What's the other thing?
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
Lara called me.
I go running down there.
Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
Somebody named Leo Crow.
All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
John.  Please.  Listen to me --
I'm not getting halo'd.
You can't run --
People want to believe in the system.  That's the beauty of it...
No doubt.
Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
You don't have to do this, Chief.
No maglev system.
Yeah?  So?
Go ahead.
Red Ball?
Confirm with trig and image.
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
Why did you catch that?
You're certain?
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
To them.
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
If it's a question of authority.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
But you call this room the "temple".
It seems I've found a flaw, John  You.
Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
Wally, listen to me...
Just go to the beginning!
I need help with her.
She's a precog?
Are you reading my mind right now?
They don't belong to anybody.
Stop --
What happened?  Where's the rest?
Rufus, play it back...
I scored a goal!
Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you, Sean.
Come on!
Sean -- you're not real.
You gotta have faith, Dad.
It's a little late for that.
Wanna hear something funny?
You're alive?
No.  He got tired of pretending.
I wanted to.
Who are you?
I'm your son.  I'm you.
Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
Do you know who I am?
Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
You're not gonna kill me?
But you have to.  They said you would.
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
Who made you do this?
Kill me!
Let go of the gun.
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
Not if I stay away from him.
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
The system would collapse.
I believe in that system...
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
Hold that thought.
What safe place is that?
If... you have one.
How do I even know which one has it?
Which one is that?
John?
He's dead, Lara.
Oh, God, what did you do?
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
It's insanity around here.
We know why John was tagged.
The guy from USA Today is here.
Sir, the press conference is starting.
Congratulations, sir.
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
Good God.  What was that?
It's the same prevision.
No, I wanna kill my boss!
This is Evanna, the team pilot.
Can't they shut that off?
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
He's trying to prove his innocence.
There a maid in this hotel?
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
What kind of cop were you before this?
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
How many?
He looks familiar.
What about your meeting?
Raincheck?
Howard --
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
This your work?
I like it.
Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
Cream and sugar.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
We used to, every summer.
I don't have any sugar either.
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
So you haven't seen his apartment?
That was our apartment.
Since right after we lost our son.
It was nobody's fault.
Nice to meet you, Wally.
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
They've never been separated before.
You're Bobby, right?
No thank you.
You sure? I just made it.
Snifter are for warm drinks --
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
We have snifters
Now, Mr. Slade, you're in room 315.
Yes, sir.
Is it a good room?
Not on me, sir.
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Are you sure?
Yeah. Take it.
Thank you very much, sir.
So?
What, sir?
Is it the good room?
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
Thank you, sir.
Where's the place to go tonight?
As far as...?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
So, wait, you're from where?
We're in Fashion.
Is he cute?
He's okay.
Should I fuck him?
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
He's great, right. Is he great?
He's alright.
Oh no. What is it this time.
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
Nobody's fuckin talking to you.
Ricky's not wearing one.
A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
She's, uh, sleeping.
What's wrong, baby?
Hello.
Chloe?
I don't know.
Mommy's not home?
No.
What time is it there?
Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
Honey?
So, what kind of gig is this?
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
No. What kind of bachelor party?
Oh my god. What happened?
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
Who's watching the baby?
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
You talk to Max today?
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
I feel weird asking him.
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
Yeah? You sure?
I'll support you.
With what?
She needs a family. A dad. I'll give her what you never had.
I never promised you anything.
Take her.
Whu --
There's no touching.
I -- I -- I... Don't...
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
What's your record at?
What's up? Jess ready?
You driving her?
C'mon girl. Eat up.
Get away from her.
What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz?
When's it going down?
No.
Brooklyn.
Where we going?
Quick drop. In and out.
Where's Ricky?
Ricky's taken care of.
That it?
This is it.
You like the ponies?
Sure. Yeah.
You bet the ponies?
Pshhh...
A million. Easy.
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
I'll work it off.
Not driving Jess, you won't.
So, that's it. I'm out?
I didn't say that.
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
You told him you liked him.
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
Yes.
What is it?
There won't be a next thing.
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
Nah.
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
You don't know where you're going?
No. Just the cross streets.
I can wait around if you want.
Spa?
Yeah.
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
Yeah?
Understand me?
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
Ricky's taken care of.
Taken care of?
Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
I'm on the phone.
Listen, man, we really gotta...
We're with Ruiz.
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
Can you check?
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
Any time, bro.
Did Max mention anything about any jobs?
What about boxing?
What about it?
So?
So, it was a draw.
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
So, it's not a winning record.
Don't be shitty.
How am I being shitty?
I'll page you.
I got no idea.
I will.
I thought you hate that club.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
Fuck them.
We need guns.
We don't need guns.
I think we might.
He didn't say we need guns.
You wanna go right now?
Sorry coach.
We look good this year.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
I like it.
It's not even yours.
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
What? Did she say something?
Who's driving her?
I don't know.
Right here's fine.
Is that the woman from..?
It's ours.
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
Maybe we should call for a cab.
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
Shhh... Hello, room service?
How much was it?
Forty-six.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Yeah, I guess.
Great. On my fucking room.
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
What exactly did they say?
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
They didn't say an address?
I told you what they said.
Nothing else.
How'd they know who you were?
They asked who it was.
So they said more than the address.
This is bullshit, man.
Sold it, stole it, whatever...
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
What the fuck is that supposed --
I mean, that's what I heard --
You know this guy?
What did I 'get?'
So is this the drop?
Like I said, I don't know.
He woulda told us right?
Yeah.
You happy?
About what?
Where do you think you're going?
You fucking nuts?
You got that right.
What the hell did you do?
What the fuck was that about?
What's up?
We're getting whacked.
Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
Put that shit out...
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
Nothing, man.
Let's do it.
Let's check out the penguins.
The what?
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
We need guns.
We don't need guns.
Float me a hundred bucks.
You're out of money?
No.
What do you have left?
Eighty.
Eighty five.
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
It's gonna be fine.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
Let's just go now and wait.
Three and a half hours?
I don't want to take any more chances.
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
No. I'll wait here.
Hey, boys.
Tom. How's it going?
Fine, fine. And you were...?
Bobby and Ricky.
C'mon...
We rep lines? You know? Fashion?
Kinda. Yeah.
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
Where's the surprise?
You want your surprise?
Yeah. I want it.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
Cardiff Giant?
What?
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
A little.
You look good, man.
Cool. See you later.
Yes?
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
How much is what?
Yes?
Drinks are free, right?
Yes.
Where do you live?
Excuse me.
You strapped?
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
See you later.
You really in trouble?
Ow, shit...
And where is...?
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
No shit?
Does anyone want another?
Sure. Anyplace in particular?
What do you want?
A little Charlie, perhaps.
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
No, really, mate?
Here they are, then.
How's it going?
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...
Good morning.
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
The Soho Grand?
Yeah.
You're from LA, right?
So you're our own private guy?
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
You know my pager number?
A lot of Persians?
I call 'em wiggers.
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
Thanks.
Yes. You're going to New York.
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
That money is your per diem.
Keys.
What?
I get it.
Tell me.
Don't worry. I get it.
So tell me how it is.
But, Max --
We're square.
No. I'll take a strega.
Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.
We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
Who's gonna outfit us?
Yeah.
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
Edinburgh.
And where might that be?
I'm working trains. Selling.
Bet you like that shit.
Keeps me out of the army.
Heard where?
Man's rep travels.
Is your papa West Indian?
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
Where can I get a hold of you?
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
Did you just now con me?
Yes, sir.
When?
How's it feel?
It hit?
1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1.  I git 'em all?
Daddy, where's my money?
What you talking?
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
You never had it.
Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying.
You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
You know it.
I'll give you back the 600.
I don't want your money.
And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down.
That's what it is. Walk on out.
Let Billie finish.
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
Yeah, got to do something about you.
Who the hell are you?
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
What did you give it to me for then?
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
Don't con me. Don't try...
Don't con me.
That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
Tell Him that.
Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?
What?
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
How do you like it?
Let's talk about you for a change.
Why do you ask?
Just an idle question.
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
What have you set your mind to?
I'm in Detroit.
Did you hear what I said?
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
Yes. Did you eat?
It won't be easy.
Just hold me.
It will be rough.
Hush your mouth.
I'll be away a lot.
Because you're in trouble.
Talk about what?
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
We need you too!
Get some sleep.
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
I'm tired of praying.
I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
Let some of us come down there.
Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend.
Let's cancel.
Is my family here yet?
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
Why don't you just ask your question?
You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
Just what is your question?
What color were the original Hebrews?
I told you we don't know for certain.
Did you see the papers today?
Can I ask you something?
Are you Elijah's pimp?
What?
I say a lot of things.
She know?
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
I better not come in.
I ain't stupid.
I mean it's late, baby.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
Get out.
Did you hear me?!
Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
What does Sidney say?
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
No. You'll be marked for death.
Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
You the man.
You evil this morning.
You will, baby -- if the time come.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
Well, all right, then.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
That's a fine chick.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
You're too small to be Bogart.
Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
Jesus, Red, she's just a kid.
That ain't bad.
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
So what about him?
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
That's right.
Head nigger in charge?
Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?
Who the hell are they?
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
Yes sir.
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
He's bright.
They talked about me like
Am I a suspect?
My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
[Where are you coming from?]
[South America.]
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
[I'm on to Juarez.]
[Why?]
A lot of people are looking for you.
I guess that makes you the smart one.
Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
Where do I find you?
Deal.
[What is his name?]
[Daniel.]
[What is his name?]
[What's the PIN number?]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[No!]
[Don't lie to me.]
[The boss did or his brother.]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[Do you know who I am?]
[The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?]
[Who ordered it?]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
[Where do I find him?]
[I don't know, I swear.]
[I believe you.]
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[What do you mean?]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[And I had my men ready.]
[Yes. Many times.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
[Maybe your men stole from you.]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
Yes.
What is it?
And what if amateurs try it?
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
I'm here.
So what's wrong?
Nothing wrong.
But don't you stay in El Paso?
You did something on impulse?
Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
What are you doing here?
I came to visit you.
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
Creasy?
I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
Where are you from, Creasy?
The United States.
No.
Why not?
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
We're taking a different way home.
Did you like school, Creasy?
No.
Not at all?
No.
And don't start crying.
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
How do you think he got out?
It's better to be free, right?
They'll be back in a week.
It hurts.
Where?
Do you always sleep with him?
Did you sleep alright?
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
Why do you ask?
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
I don't understand.
Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
No.
Did you used to?
You're late.
Where's my mother?
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
I know you're not.
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
What's so important in Los Angeles?
Could I ask you a question?
Could I stop you?
You don't drink like you used to.
Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
The world of our children. How dare they?
You're American.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
How are you getting along with Pinta?
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
It makes it all seem so serious.
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
Rosanna Guerrero.
It's Creasy.
Last night. Do you know something?
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
[You have the money.]
[Yes.]
You should be sleeping, baby.
I like him, Mom.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
She likes him.
Hmm?
He has to go, Samuel.
What? Who?
That's ridiculous.
I've just been so busy, Lisa.
It will be a hard break.
She's young. She'll get over it.
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
[You only fuck me to get information.]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
Two tourists who never went home.
You helped him get this job.
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
Hey, Herbie...
So waddaya feel like doing tonight?
She probably got a date by now, Angie.
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
What makes you say that?
I could see she likes you.
Yeah, sure.
So what do you feel like doing tonight?
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
What for?
It must be one o'clock.
All right, I'll see you!
I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
I told this dog I was gonna call her today about two-thirty.
Hey! What are you doing here?
I feel fine.
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
I don't think I remember him.
It's her baby too, you know.
That's my son Thomas's baby.
What happen?
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
When was this?
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
It pains that they should do this.
Who?
...you teach chemistry? That's funny. Where? What school?
This is the kitchen.
Yes, I know.
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
No...
Please...
No...
Please...
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
You got an elevator in this house?
We just live one flight up.
So I'll call you tomorrow.
Siddown, siddown. You want some chicken? We got some chicken in the ice box.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
Are you kidding?
I'm just here with another girl.
Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?
That's the one.
What time is it?
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
You gonna die without a son.
So I'll die without a son.
You not ugly.
Marty...
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
I said, is she Italian girl?
You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
Don't bring her to the house no more.
...and they sit down right next to me...
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
That's swell, Missus Fusari.
He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...
That's all right, that's all right...
On accounta...
Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
Wadda you so sore about?
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
You talked to Walt?
What is, Red, the intention or the act?
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
Yes, O'Reilly?
That's right.
Where?
Hospital.
Which hospital?
Miss you, Walt.
Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
Well, he's taken care of. Scratch one hot dog.
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome!
Wisconsin.
So long, Ho-Jon.
You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
We've stuck it out for a whole week now... Pretty girl.
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
Never heard of him.
Look at the size of those two beasts.
Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
When?
Any time. Whenever we want.
There's no transportation anyway this time of night.
We could steal one of the choppers.
Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
I have a tent to myself.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
We're a good team.
We think the same way.
Ravenous. What about you?
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
Frank...
Wait a second...
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
I was just asking...
But what about Major Houlihan?
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
You betcher ass, Dad.
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
A-negative. I've cross-matched it.
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
C-A-M-E-M...?
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
...But I turned in my knee pads.
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
Is he out?
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
I don't feel anything.
All of them?
That's right. We work well together.
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
The bastards outconned us.
I think we could still have a chance.
See you.
It's possible
No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
You're an attractive man.
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
But I'm married.
Something else we have in common.
Very happily married.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
Even if I weren't.
I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
Second pint.
I didn't have much choice.
Excuse me, Sergeant.
What do you want with those two medical officers?
Thanks.
He's coming to.
No, never in the slightest.
In the direction you want to go.
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
You can cut the bow.
I have not understood what you means.
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
What's going on? Who started this?
You mean who hit who?
Yes, that's what I mean.
O'Reilly!
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Sir?
Oh, get out of here!
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
What's that, Henry?
Morning, girls. Good morning Major.
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
How is he?
Nice.
Nice.
Huh?
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
Action?
Against anything. Just protest.
Oh, yuh did, huh?
Hello, John.
Me?
Can I help you pack?
Ted Sheldon.
Go ahead, driver! Ball park!
Yes, sir.
How much money do you get?
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
A third party?
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
The Websters.
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
Wait a minute . . .
That's your father's diary, Ann.
What's that?
The letter.
What letter?
The letter from John Doe.
There is no letter.
We'll get a handwriting expert to  What!
You made it up.
In what man!
John Doe.
Well, you're catching on.
Who, for instance?
Okay, sister, you get your job back.
Plus a bonus.
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
Hurry up, Pop.
Oh.
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Okay, fellows.
What's the idea?
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
No.
Have you seen him?
Where's Connell?
He's watching the other door.
Oh, let me go, will you!
Had any schooling?
Yeah, a little.
Ann! Say, why didn't yuh
What?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Help yourself.
The heelots!
The heelots!
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
How could he be a fake? 
A what?
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
I gotta figure some way out of this thing!
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Now, that's all right, isn't it?
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for
Well, I don't get it.
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
That's got nothing to do with it!
Were you paid for itor weren't you?
What difference does that make?
Did you write itor didn't you?
It's for Ann . . .
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later.
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
That's too bad.
What do you mean, too bad?
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a
Spencer of the Chronicle .
Out the window! Something just flew by!
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
They're not usually graduate students.
Floor seats.
You're my hero.
Dinner's on you.
Where's the stereo?
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
What's the line?
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
What happened, Mike.
This has nothing to do with Walter.
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
Where's the car?
Am I gettin' the car?
Automatic.
Hold on a second here.
You signed out twice.
Hi, Roper.
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
That's right.
What's the suspect's name?
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
Anything on Korda so far?
Are you in charge, Roper?
Is that all?
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
It's all there.
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
You ever been in a hostage situation?
Only at the very end.
How do you feel after a shooting.
It rarely has to be done.
I've rarely shot anyone.
I know.
So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
Recruited you from where?
Furthest point I could find from New York.
You'd never been out of New York?
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
How did you like Toronto?
It was okay.
Is there something wrong with that?
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
I don't really like to drink.
You have to. It's a tradition.
You got a girlfriend?
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
We see each other every couple of months.
No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
Where did you hear that?
I think I can handle that one.
You think you can learn, McCall?
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
I'm not good at lying.
Get good at it.
You know the ten commandments?
Yes.
What's the first commandment?
You tell me.
Yes.
Why?
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
You know why I like the track?
I have two words for you... Seek help.
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
So what do you want?... An autograph.
I'm just practicing my lying.
The 6 horse is last.
To run last?
The 6 horse is still last.
They need to run first and second?
The jockey!
We won!
We lost.
How long you been coming here?
About six years. My partner took me.
Is it always like this?
There's your answer. He's smart.
He's cutting down the visibility.
He's got the girl.
What the fuck is going on.
You're crazy.
It might have happened no matter who was up there.
And what about the ones you don't save?
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
And what if you can't live with it?
Have you evacuated anyone?
Only that floor.
I know how you feel, Ray.
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
I worship you.
You worship yourself.
Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
I'm not drunk. Yet.
Maybe you should be.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
Scott, You can't save everyone.
What do you want from me?
You think I didn't need you?
I wanted to get this out of the way.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
I've been craving that stuff all week.
What do you think?
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
It's okay. We broke up.
When?
You like this place?
Yeah?
Korda escaped.
Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
Stay here, don't move.
Scottie...
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
Scottie?
Hmm?
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
...the hell are you talking about?
You crazy? With all those people around?
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
The hell I am!
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
Roper.
You let us worry about that.
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
What do you think would be in order?
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
The car is part of the deal.
Repoed this morning.
I can't do that.
Roper...
Who's running it!
What have you promised them?
Yeah, they are but...
This is Halden.
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
What do you need?
God-Damn you!
It's okay.
Okay...
Why?
How come I can't remember?
As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --
Do you believe in miracles?
You were right.
Who are you?!
The guests are here.
Guests?
But this is impossible.
What's happening?
It's time to wake up.
Wake up?!
No.
Yes.
In a computer program.
The new world.
It's not real.
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
But once the system touches the net, all links are severed.  Everybody dies.
Where the hell are you going?
Unfinished business.
And what about the reconfiguration?
You sure he's going to come?
It's his nature.
But what if he doesn't --
How long 'till we can eject?
We're going to have to reconfigure.
Where you plugged-in from?
New York.
What?
What's her name?
Who?
Get some internal police there. Tell them to run a perimeter.
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
The only way to eject it is from the inside.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
One condition.
What?
A hotel?
Why?
What did he tell you?
The truth.
Not his style.
Then you had her killed.
Why would I do that?
There was no need to kill her.
Then where is she?
An interface attendant.
Where?
Need the disk back!
Insurance.
What brings you inside?
Cleaning up a mess.
I've got to get back.
Then how do you know about --
-- The inside?
Identical.  One's you.  One's digital.
But I don't know anything about programming.
Why?
It was a test.
Realize?
And it meant something.
What?
I wasn't with you.
I know.
But you were with me.
Not you.  A copy.
I'm sorry.
Sorry?!
Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
What's so funny?
This.  No point to it.
Why not?
Because you'll never believe me.
It was just there.
Just like that?
Voice activate.
Activated.
Resurrection.
Destination?
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Connection approved.  Ready to transmit --
Access granted.  Male or female?
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
Standard, modern, upscale --
-- Standard.
Program name?
Connect to public access.
We've got him locked!
He's on us!!
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
WE CAN'T BREAK FREE!
It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.
What?!
Is this... food!
Yeah, right.
I heard that!
I can hardly walk...
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION!
Anybody see anything?
SABER TOOTH TIGER!
Let's teach these vermin a few manners.
That's pretty bad.
Release the power WITH the power.
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
... Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers...
I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
What's a Triac?
PTERODACTYL!
You okay?
Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension.
NINJA CRANE ZORD!
That's the only way to the Monolith...
NEW POWER COINS!!
THREE DEGREES OFF THE COMETS TRAJECTORY!
009843... 42... 41!  WE'RE IN ALIGNMENT!
Let's go after him!!
IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
The Stealth Eagle is about to fly.
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
Here you go!  No pushing!
Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
There goes the neighborhood.
SKULL!!
It's... an eagle?
Look closer.
And how do we release the power?
Just shut your gap!
I'm outta here.
GET OFF ME!
Simon says...
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
That was a CHEAP shot!
Anybody see them?
How the heck?!...
THREE SECONDS!!
NINJA APE ZORD!
And I ain't no nigger either!
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
We're asking you to go to prison.
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.
The goddamned bastards.
Poor, yeah.
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
Boo-Boo.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
You scare me, Charlie.
Are you frightened?
I had everything. Once.
So what happened?
I came into this world flat on my ass.
And now you have everything.
I guess I am. Just a little.
What do you mean?
When my money moves, I go with it.
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
Four-twenty-eight.
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
From your mouth ta God's ear.
We could lose the deal!
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
Shane was a friend of yours?
But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
Who hired the bastard?
You ain't even a man yet.
Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
The deal's too good, Frankie
Inside, they were talking of you.
I can just imagine.
No. They envy you.
For being a bootlegger?
You here with Bobby?
What's the matter?
I'm already late.
Luciano.
I was calling yesterday.
Something came up.
Same here.
It's a mask.
You got something to hide?
It's too late.
Have you thought about this?
Why? You're the innocent one.
You could have stopped him.
I booked passage to London.
Charlie?
I'm doin' business here!
Meyer just finished the books.
Meyer.
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
You're getting' 10 cc's
You bastards, I said twenty!
It'll just be a few minutes.
Who?
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
Come off it, Bugs.
Come off it, Bugs.
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
I like that.
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
This business is about taking risks.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
He's trying to make it.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
What the fuck does that mean?
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
Boss, I got all the time you need.
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
You gotta plan these things.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
The kid just called me stupid.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
One move pardner, and you're a dead man.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
I must know more of you, my son.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
And how many soldiers do you have?
What about the share.
You get fifteen percent.
I found that out.
We learn from life.
Conditions have changed. Some people have become too powerful.
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
They do what I tell 'em.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
We must be friends, Charlie.
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
Masseria's been after me too.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
Bring order out of chaos. If you lead... they'll follow.
And what do you want out of this?
Shuddup.
Wanna know what I think?
Where's the stiff?
Jesus.
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
Maranzano wants you dead.
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
What a cozy little scene.
Kill them! Kill them!
Anything ain't a very hard number.
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
That a Jew compliment?
Take any one ya like.
You're fuckin' crazy.
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
Switch hands.
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
Uhh - martini?
Olive or eyeball?
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
Death! Thank you!
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
Bitchin' good cake.
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
Sure. Why?
You're acting kind of...odd.
What are you watching?
You sure this is...medically advisable?
Got a doctor on duty.
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
What's the "bad" part?
Did we just - <u>hit</u> something?
I don't think so.
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
How was it? I don't recall.
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
What's the matter?
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
Don't ask where I got it.
Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
I'm reportin' this to my union!!
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
Stu...Stu...
IT'S NOT WORKING.
Stu...LOOK!
What?
You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
I just need to use the phone, lady.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
We like to think so, yeah.
Who told you we deal drugs?
Is there something else I can do for you?
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
You want to come inside?
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
Uh-huh?
... What are they all doing there?
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
How are you doing sweetheart?
I'm good.
What pictures?
You know ...  ... whoops!
Behind the books.
I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
He seemed quite taken with you.
I don't want to talk about it.
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, I hope so, dear.
It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
Who is it?
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night.
What does he do?
Are you sure you got my bag in?
So, you come here all by yourself?
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Thanks very much, sonny--
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
I did not--
You've never *seen* this contract.
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
Looks like it, but--
But it *isn't*?
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.
Positively not in the station! Gone!
And while you're at it, get me a bed!
Let's send out a pigeon!
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
Would you settle for a husband?
Huh?
Oh--that again. Yeah.
You got worms.
What! Who?
Will you go chase an ambulance!
Kid--wait--what do you think you're going to do?
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute.
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.
What do I play?
You play--left field.
Did you like the first act?
Paine.
Why do I always laugh at that?
Drunks are funny--
Yeah. Funny--
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
*I'm* just waiting for a street car--
Again? Good idea.
Diz--
Yeah.
How about getting married?
Any time.
Tonight?
Okay. You don't mind?
Have *you*?
No.
Do we *have* to?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
Well, let's get going.
Where?
We're gonna get married.
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
What?
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
Huh?
You know, we're getting married.
The war's on!
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
What is it?
Sam Foley--dead!
Taylor, my dear.
No wonder--without your dinner.
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
How do you feel, champ?
One minute! Just one minute!
They put up *their* candidate? Who?
I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--
Jim, that bunch is out for blood. If I throw Horace in their teeth now--
I *won't* send Horace Miller!
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
*But you never asked me*!
Y-yes, Jim.
Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
I did. What about it?
Than what?
Jeff for Senator.
A dirty frame!
I *thought* I heard... Yes?
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Yes. Come in.
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
The porter's got them. They're coming.
Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
Look! There it is!
H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
He's a newspaper publisher I know-- and--
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
Mr. President!
Well, it isn't much, but if you insist, here's this week's. 
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
Well--goodnight.
Goodnight, Jeff.
Yield *how*, sir?
Will he yield for a question?
Ah, now, that's better.
Mr. President! A point of order!
Please, sir!--come with me!
Oh, now--
Jefferson--
Jerry! Blackie! Queenie! Let's have it quiet, fellows!
Now, Amos, now--  What?
Certainly would, Joseph.
How's Amos, Ma?
You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
What is it?
Office of--Senator Smith?
*No*!
The man downstairs said number--
What's your name?
There *what* was?
Whose statue is that?
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
No, gee--I couldn't stay here--
Go ahead--punch.
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
Oh, but this one is so simple.
I see. *This* one is so simple--
Oh, just a day--
A *day*!
Committee, huh?
Committee.
Yes, I see that.
Good. Where are we?
What's that?
What?
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
No! Go right ahead, Miss Saunders.
Thanks very much.
Well--gosh--that--that isn't "particulars," is it?
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
You mean--here?
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
Have you always had to--work?
Since sixteen or so.
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
I also answer to whistles.
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
Well, if it's all the same to you--
I know. It's--Violet.
Abigail.
No!
Lena.
No! Stop it!
I've got more. You better tell me.
You win. It's--Clarissa.
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
In Terry Canyon?
Must have been tickled pink.
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
Thanks a lot.
Hello.
What you *have* to do is fight!
Yay!
Where do we go from here?
Whoa! Hold it! Pipe down! Come on, now--that's enough of that.
Oh--you are!
Then you *did* say it.
Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
I'm splendid, too.
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
Well! Hear anything? Any sign of him?
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
What do you mean? What's going on?
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!
Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
Let's get away from here. 
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
That's right.
Yeah?  And what else?
Why don't you do it yourself?
He's lost complete faith in me--
Well--me, too!
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
You won't stand for it?
Jeff--this is Mr. Taylor.
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
Jim!
Just a minute, Joe!
It's crucifying him--!
Anything *better* to offer?
Maybe he won't get up.
Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!
Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!
His first 'whiff'!
Do I actually *see* this--?
Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
Mr. President...
Will the Senator yield?
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
That's going to be fun.
Good morning.
Deeds?
Since he was born.
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
They think he's pixilated.
Pixilated.
Sometimes he whistles.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
He sure is pixilated.
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
Oh, yes.
He's still pixilated.
Are you married?
Yes, sir.
Any children?
Thank you very much.
No. Are you?
I haven't.
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
Yes!
Are these the articles?
Are they true!
NO!!
But they did take place?
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
And you saw them happen?
Yes, but I
That's all, Miss Bennett.
It isn't all! I'd like to explain
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
What's that got to do with it?
You are , aren't you?
You fainted.
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
Look, this is my house. I'd like to
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
What?
Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
What did they say?
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
What are they going to do?
Yes.
That depends on what they see.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
Here's a nice place.
Oh, that
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
I've often thought about going back.
He played in the town band, too.
He did? I play the tuba
What did he play?
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
I didn't think you could come with the party and everything.
Yes, if it isn't too late.
Let's just walk, okay?
Mary, I'm going home.
Are you? When?
Well, here we are again.
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
Hello, Mary?
What's the matter, hon?
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
Uh-huh.
I'm crucifying him.
People have been crucified before.
Why? Why do we have to do it?
Yeah, then what?
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
You're a fool, Babe.
Just a minute. No, you don't.
Can I have a month's vacation?
With pay!
With pay!
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
Did it?
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
How'd you get the picture?
With pay!  She is out the door.
What's bothering you, huh?
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That"
What're you going to do?
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
That's the rub.
I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
Come on, come on!
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.
Ow! My foot's asleep!
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Who? Miss Dawson?
You try it.
Gold, eh?
Yes, sir.
Fourteen carat?
Yes, sir.
Is that the best you've got?
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
Me sir?
How is this, sir?
Perfect! Perfect!
You can't come up here!
Let me go! I wanna see him!
He's not home, I tell you!
I wanna see that guy!
Thank heaven.
Relatives of old man Semple.
Miss Bennett please!
It's a lie!
But your honor
I can't find him.
Look!
What?
Where?
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
Yes.
How do you do.
Yes.
Are your parents living?
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
Will you have a cigar?
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
Nah.
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
Have a drink?
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
Uh-huh.
That's funny. Why is that?
What're you talking about?
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Arthur wants to quit!
Oh, they insisted on following me.
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
Sometimes it's the only solution.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
Why, it's an artistic institution
Me?!
Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
my wife wanted me to tell you she  she prays for you every night.
What kind of wife did you say she was?
A child? My uncle's?
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
No, I mean - about my client.
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
No - I don't want it, thank you.
Your Honor
Proceed.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I write poetry.
Brookfield just came in.
Who are they?
What is your name?
Christian Svenson.
Farmer?
Yes, ma'am.
Where is your farm?
South Dakota north.
South Dakota - north?
South Dakota - but on the top.
Is she home?
Yeah. What?
You mean  by the neck or something?
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
What do you think you're doing?
No, sir.
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
Twenty! What did he do with them?
You're Walter, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
What's that?
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
You came home last night - without them.
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
You try it.
Me, sir?
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
Shall I call the police, sir?
Me more than most.
Why are they ganging up against me?
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
You can go out there if you like...
Dr. Mumford.
Mr. Cook.
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
Were you supposed to have a session?
I'm fine.
You're the shrink, aren't you?
No, not really.
But you do therapy?
What an asshole!
Ernest, what do you think?
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
What are you doing for lunch?
I have eighteen more minutes!
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
What?
Why? I'm paying for this.
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
Where's your wife, Henry?
I was... never satisfied.
What's that?
What is it?
It's a thought I had.
What exactly is it supposed to do?
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
What do you do?
Althea hasn't told you?
You're the doctor, what do you think?
I'm sorry, your honor.
What?
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
I'd better get in there.
That's a lot of people all at once.
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
You do?
Yeah.
You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
My patient had to leave early.
How long you been in this town?
So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?
You like me. How come?
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
And the Brocketts?
Where am I supposed to eat?
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
...so rich?
Doc...
Lily.
You would have met in some shower eventually...
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
-- you crazy? You can't do this!
Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
Got a license?  But no car?
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
That would explain it.
Can you help Mom?
I'm trying.
What's wrong with her?
Hiya, Doc.
Martin.
What's happening here?
Ph.D., psychologist.
Finally, some common sense...
What do you mean?
I think you know what I mean.
No, I really don't.
I think you do.
Wow. You're something.
Well, look who's here...
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
Just who is here, can you tell me?
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
I don't know. I barely made it today.
We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
I'm not making any promises.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
Is she against you getting help?
We don't discuss it.
Please... forgive me.
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
I've offended you!
No.
Is this the treatment?
Sore throat?
Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Where?
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
I can give myself a headache instantly.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
So whose route is this?
You like it?
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
That's what I like.
My brother said you were about to fire me.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
What was that?
Transference!
Hello?
I guess you saw the show...?
Which show was that?
...How violated I feel?
I am irate!
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
What?
Will you think about it?
Anything... just ask.
You got off easy.
Will you wait for me?
In maybe three or four issues.
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
What happened today?
What are you talking about?
Was it something that happened at school?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
What'd he say?
You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.
Would you like another beer?
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
This is great!
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
She's probably ten years older than you.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
What?
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
Guess.  Go ahead, guess!
Slash what?
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
Really?
Who else knows?
Damn! What is your name?
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
I've told you a lot of private stuff.
I can tell you anything else.
But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
Everybody has a story, Skip.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
It wasn't the best situation.
"Get to know your therapist."
You were messed up, man.
At least you pulled yourself out...
Things got a lot worse.
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
No... no training.
Psych major?
Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
Sorry...
I guess that makes sense.
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
You know where he's taking her?
Who the hell are these guys?
I never killed a priest before.
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
And how does one do that?
Oh yes, of course.
And then killing your sister.
Now go find me a big stick.
What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
None of the above, thank you.
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
Why do you like to fight so much?
Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
Where's your new friend?
Immune from what?
Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
Yeah?
Intestines.
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
You will not believe it.
So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
The sun turning black.
You bastards!
The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
Where are they taking him?
No women allowed.
I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
Two hundred pounds.
Proceed!
You lie.
Fifty percent.
A bright good morning to all.
So who's the broad?
No.
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
I just decked your brother
Yeah, I was there.
You swear?
Every damn day.
What did you find? What did you see?
Yes.
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
You know your history.
We're almost there.
That "thing" gets me excited.
What are those mirrors for?
Preparation for what?
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
You two!
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
No you're not.
I'm not?
Not unless you call me Rick.
Why would I do that?
You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him.
Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
I'm staying.
Don't do it, Evelyn.
Have you no respect for the dead?
Jonathan?
Yes?
I was mistaken.
I'm your sister.
That just makes you more gullible.
But he's just a filthy criminal?
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
What do you suppose killed him?
I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
I found it, Evy! I found it
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
Finish the inscription, idiot!
Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!
Hey,... don't I know you?
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
That thing gives me the creeps.
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
Who's here!?
Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.
What?
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!
I know you did.
I knew you'd know.
I know you knew I'd know.
Um-hmm.
Except for one little thing.
Everything's going exactly as we planned.
It must have slipped my mind.
Where are you going?
I thought you were done?
Our guests are waiting.
You two timing psychotic bastard.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
We didn't think this through very well.
When was that?
Much less go outside.
We could really use some coffee --
Come on, baby!
Atta, girl!
Hey, do I look like a Man?
Who are you?
And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
How about... the Savage Six?
But you're a superhero.
It's late. I'm headin' home.
No one will believe us.
Sounds good to me.
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
What did he mean?
Hey... you okay?
Yes!
Doctor Heller?
Thanks.
How's your dad?
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
Snap out of it!
Ummm.
I got it.
Superheroes.
Should I kill them?
That boy's got talent.
They always call the great ones nuts.
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Against.
You're dead.
And the light goes out...
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
Are you an actress?
Just a waitress.
Sure -- I guess.
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
How 'bout giving me "the tour"?
Who's the artist?
Come here.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Then why are you here?
Curiosity.
I'd better go.
You're a spy.
I guess... Are you always so angry?
Or talk?
Hi.
Alone tonight?
Date?
Sure.
I admire you.
I wouldn't mind being famous.
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
What's your real name?
Roy.
It's home.
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
I just want to be a superhero.
It's me.
At the Frankenstein Center.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
I'm going inside.
What?
Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.
You're the Sphinx.
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
My heart died a long time ago.
Oh don't start that again --
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
We had an off night, that's all.
What are you talking about?
And it would be the right thing to do.
So what else has Superman got?
This place is built like a fortress.
GET MAD!
But she still might call!
Are you coming or not?
I'll drive.
Cover me!
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
I can't.
So you're chicken?
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
Or flowers.
I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
Let's go.
I'm soaked.  Oh great.
So where's the art?
What's that?
The Obliterators!
Firepower costs money.
Yes, Obie-wan.
We're superheroes.
Are you famous?
Not yet.
So what can I get you?
Here you go. 
Jeffrey!
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
It's on the television.
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
Mother... it's not what you think!
But... the silverware?
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
She likes you.
Definitely.
This is bad.
Who are they?
We may be getting in over our heads here.
Or Batman --
Don't crunch the leaves.
Be a Mohican.
And there's the Sphinx.
And a social life.
To us!
Are you sure he's still lives here?
But, Doc... where's the machine guns?
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
Oh no.
We've got lift off!
Where am I going?
I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.
And, what a delightful idea!
Ah -- you approve?
I think it's absolutely charming.
I'm glad you like it.
Yes -- who spoke up?
I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
About 5,000 troops.
Any cannon?
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
You could have them here by daybreak.
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
Properly arranged, yes.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
I'm not insulted.
You realize what is at stake?
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
And where is the army?
Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.
Who is there?
General Bonaparte?
I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
Yes, sir?
Oh -- where do you come from?
Bastia -- and you?
Ajaccio.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Hello there, Picart.
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
Why are you carrying the dog?
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
My God...!  What time is it?
Four o'clock.
When did it start?
The first reports came in at about ten.
Why didn't you wake me then?
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
How did it spread so quickly?
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.
I am, Citizen.  Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?
Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
Shall we move closer to the fire?
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
Would you like some brandy?
Thank you.
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
What's your name?
Lisette.
Only Lisette?
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
No... nothing at all.
Well, you shall see.
Ah, that is good.
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
May I offer you a drink?
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
No.
Were they pretty?
Were any of them prettier than I am?
One had better legs.
Promise me you will never leave me.
I cannot promise you that.
I don't understand you.
Promise.
Promises mean nothing.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
All right -- I promise.
Yes -- what is it?
Open the door.  It's me.
Go away -- I'm busy.
I know what you're doing in there.
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
Five minutes.
Five minutes.
Separate bedrooms?
But you will not... be safe...
I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
What are you talking about?
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
Yes.
What?
Yes, I wrote it.
You wrote it.
I couldn't face telling you.
You couldn't face telling me what?
About Hippolyte Charles.
What was there to tell?
Do you know what you're saying?
God help me -- yes.
How do you know?
I know.
Can you give me a drink, please?
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
Do you like music?
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
Does she deserve anything better?
Has Alexander agreed to this?
And where do you place Alexander?
What did you say his name was?
Eugene de Beauharnais.
Is he alone?
Come in.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
Come in.
A message from Citizen Fouche.
Come in.
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
Anything you need.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
And I can go free?
Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
Yeah.
I know you smoke weed, right?
Why you say that?
I don't know!
No.  Thought he was with you.
Stretch it out.
Who are you?
We didn't come here for Day-Day.
No I'm not.
Great moves, Day-Day.
What you mean talk to her?
You know what he mean, dude.
Naw, I already ate.
Me neither.
Man, Day-Day is my people!
What's crackin'?
I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy!
I can't taste nothing.
Who is that?
So.
You know what this is?
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.
What's the matter?
Blow.
It works.
Alright, Roach, see you around.
You see that?
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
You go first.
Naw, you go first.
You go first.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
Wait.
You're welcome, Unc.
I will.  When can I come visit?
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
Oh yeah, why you walking?
Hello, remember me?
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
Most definitely.
Huh?
I did.  Is that door locked?
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
Next time, page me first.
You alright?
Delivery!
Delivery!
Here I come!
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
I do.
What it smell like?
All damn.
Nice neighborhood, huh?
Craig, remember what I told you.
You see that?
You too.
Smokin' what?
Nice to meet you?
Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
I can't give you your damn money back on this.
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
That the big one, huh?
What was that?
Roach, what are you doing?
Who the fuck is that, Day-Day?
Let it go, Roach, trust me.
I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one.
Try an' hold it, man.  Squeeze your ass cheeks together.
Roach...Roach, come on.
Where's Craig?
He's inside the house?
You wanna knock?
Hey.
What?!  What that mean?
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
Ah damn.  Damn.
I got fired too.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Where's Craig?
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
Shut up!  Both of you right now!
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
Why would he take it?  He don't even know you.
Where did Craig move to?
Rancho Cucamonga?
You too big.
Debo!  Debo!
I can't feel my legs no more.
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
Hey, how you get out of here.
I'll take you later.
Hey, what's going on?
'Take your car?'
I got your message.  Where's Craig?
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
What about that ugly dog?
Need to lose some weight.
Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.
My back.
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
Elroy, what happen?
I threw my back, again.
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
What's he doing here?
Don't remind me.
What happened here?
All right, I'll do it.
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
Amtrack?
You just come in on Amtrack?
Uh, yes..
Business or pleasure?
Somebody close?
What?
I need your help.
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
You were saying?  Your daughter....?
I...
She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph.
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
That's...a comfort to hear.
I have a problem.
That's right.
And your husband works for somebody else.
There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.
I would also like to apologize.
For what?
Good luck.
Come with us, sir.
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
Yes, yes, I understand.
You're out of your mind.
What's your point?
I will do no such thing.
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
Are you 'fucking with me!?
The gun...
You get another chance in ten minutes.
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
How should I...?
I killed you.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
I kill her - and you kill me.
Keep your voice down.
How am I supposed to get away?
One thirty. California Ballroom.
No.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
You know what I'm gonna do.
Is that something precious?
My wife always said I had a problem trusting people.
All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
I think you better put that away.
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
No way.
Ready?
Nods.
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
Will you promise me that?
I promise.
All right. Kisses to you.
No...kisses to you.
No. Kisses to you.
You got anything smaller?
Keep it.
It's a twenty.
Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
You remember me?
Oh, man...
Mister, what are you dragging me into?
Cover your mouth.
What are you supposed to do?
Keep the change.
Meet Irene.
Hi.
Irene is going to help.
Well?
Thanks for the shine.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
Fuckin' A.
Oh, we'll have to do better than that.
Goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come here!
Gimme a dollar.
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
That's pretty good.
I've done much better ones than this.
I'm not a baby.
Close your eyes.
Why?
I've got something for you.
You got this under control?
Yeah.
It's under control.
That one.
I'm looking for them.
And what happens if I don't call you?
Only you.
That's enough.
Yeah.
Come Back.
Yeah.
Put her on.
What gives?
Any trouble?
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
What do you figure he done with it?
Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
Where's your Mom?
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Here they come.
Yes, Dad.
You understand?
..."and I won't never tell about the money."
Ain't seen you in a coon's age, Johnny.
How's your sister Pearl?
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?
Uncle Birdie!
I'll light the lamp.
Where's Ruby?
AAA-MENN!
You have all sinned!
And the Lord told that man --
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
Say what, Walt Spoon!
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
About what!
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
What's wrong, Mother?
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
Is he hit pretty bad?
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
Lynch him! Lynch him!
Bluebeard!
He lied!
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
John don't like him much.
There's something else.
What?
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
You go set down by the River.
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
I must wend my way down River on the Lord's work.
Satan.
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
You, Pearl. You swear too.
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
Hing, hang, hung.
Why?
John...
Now can I tell?
You swore, Pearl!
It's all here.
Where's Mom?
She's gone to Moundsville.
To see Dad?
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
Where are we goin', John?
I'm hungry, John.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
John?
John, where are we g --
Are we goin' home, John?
John, where's your folks?
Dead.
Where ye from?
I mind you said there was two.
I'll see to Pearl.
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
Tell me what, boy?
What are you doing, boy?
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
It -- she --
I don't know nothin'!
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
All right boy: where's the money?
All right...  Come along.
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
Now: Where?
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
Nothin'. 
Yes?
Now it's your turn.
What secret shall I tell?
How old are you?
Sure, that's no secret.
What's your name?
Yes; John's bad.
All right.
Naturally.
About our secrets.
No.
Why, pray tell?
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
What's their names?
Pearl and John.
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
Didn't you have no inkling?
Yes; from the first night.
The first night?
Our honeymoon.
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
Harry!
Get up, Willa.
Harry, what --
Do you want more children, Willa?
Are you through praying?
You were listening outside the parlor window.
Mornin', ladies.
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
Them kids is yours?
My flesh and blood!
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
What's wrong, John?
What do you want?
Them kids!
What are you after them for?
You'll whip me!
When did I ever?
What you been up to?
Now who was this?
What'd you all talk about?
Pearl and John.
Miz Cooper!
What?
Okay, good. She's asleep.
Oh my god, oh my god...
Worked like a charm.
It's just a stupid cat.
So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.
Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
Because he was scary, that's why.
What the hell's going on!?
Okay?
Jesus, it's dark in here.
Yeah. So?
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
What happens if they don't do that?
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
Hi.
Who?
My dream.
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
How you doing, pal?
She dreamed this would happen...
Decide to take a day off after all?
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
He's dangerous.
Hello Nancy.
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
She lived there.
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
Who? Who did that?
Krueger.
It wasn't that serious...
Where you think you're going?
Right home after.
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
I won't.
Get into bed.
You okay?
Great
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
I must be going nuts...
I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
It's real, Mamma. Feel it.
Screw sleep!
What's with the bars?
All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
I never touched her.
Someone else was there.
How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
Rod says the sweetest things.
Nice to have a fire.
Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too. He might get jealous.
What the hell you doing here?
You feel better now, right?
Jungle man fix Jane.
No more fights?
Well, here are fifty francs.
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
What is it, Ninotchka?
Good evening, Anna.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
What are you serving?
You should be more careful, Anna.
And you too, Ninotchka.
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
I have nothing to hide.
Tell me... what else did you have?
Well, a hat...
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
An evening gown.
A dress you wear in the evening.
Yes.
You want this?
You wouldn't like Razinin.
And how is Lord Lavenham?
Are we free, Buljanoff?
No, that's not him...
Or it might be the firing squad!
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
That must be the one!
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
And they might believe her in Moscow.
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
What a lovely room you have here.
She's right...  anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
I am Comrade Buljanoff.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
Which lawyer?
Comrade Buljanoff...
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
It is high time you got out of Russia.
Guest?
Good morning, Your Highness.
Good evening, Gaston.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
Your breakfast, monsieur.
What time have you, Gaston?
Eight forty-two, sir.
Your Highness...
Are they indeed? Thank you.
Is this satisfactory?
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
We can call our ambassador.
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
Yes, Leon...
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
Let's do that.
...des petites fraises des bois... de la crème de Bretagne... 
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
We don't want to be disturbed.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
If you want to see us you must come later.
Razinin.
And if we have to go to Siberia...
What did she say about me?
Comrade Buljanoff...
Comrade.
Comrade Kopalski...
Two thousand francs.
A week?
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
Bad news?
Yes, monsieur?
This is Comrade Kopalski.
I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
That's even better.
Yes, monsieur.
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
Allow me, Comrade.
If there is anything we can do for you...
How are you, you three scoundrels?
That's two weeks from Thursday...
You want me to go in there?
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
Don't hold that against me... please!
Business.
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
Yes!
I must get into that country of yours!
Why should I take a chance?
What for... why?
You, please.
How long do we have to wait here?
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
No.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
Suppress it.
For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
That's a strange angle.
Please don't misunderstand me...
Then you don't want me to go there.
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
He takes good care of that.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
Ni-notchka.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
I'd like to say it a thousand times.
The bayonet? Did you really?
I was wounded before Warsaw.
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
Do you hear that?
Was that talkative?
Glorious, analytical...
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
As a representative of Moscow...
You know I want to...
But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!
I don't like your following me.
Then how did you get here?
I always eat here.
What are you after?
Will you smile?
Why?
Just smile.
Because we are an odd couple.
Probably not.
Do you like Scotch stories?
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
I promise... I swear.
Did you make any change in this room?
How do you do?
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
You must, darling.
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
What, darling?
Comrades! Comrades!
Darling, darling... please!
I must talk to my brothers!
But, darling, you can't do that.
Comrades! Good people of France!
No speech?
No speech.
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
Are we going to build our little house?
Yes... a little white house.
Not white, darling.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
No! No!
...and we won't clench our fist...
No! No!
Our salute will be a kiss.
Would that make you any happier?
Much happier.
Let's turn on the radio.
No music.
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
Yes, sweetheart. 
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
Hello, Leon!
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
Did I hear something about jewels?
You can't imagine.
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
Thank you.
Is this your new dress suit?
Yes, Swana.
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
She's gone, Leon.
Hello, Leon darling!
Please come to the point. What is it you want?
That's all right... I grow on people.
I must insist that you leave.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
Here, please...
What do you want?
Well... that's my business, madame.
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
Cigarette?
You want me to go to Constantinople?
Bring me something simple. I never think about food.
Where to, madame?
Where do you eat?
At Père Mathieu's.
Where is that?
It's just a place for workmen.
Your Highness.
How do you do, my friend.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
Executive clemency ...
You want me to put it all in writing? Over my signature?
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
I'll bet he would.
How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States?
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
You do it.
The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
It's a code or something.
I figured that out.
And?
He wants money.
This is not a joke, John!
We can't touch Hoover --
He's begging for a meeting, chief.  He wants to go overseas for awhile.
I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies.
May I say something, Mr. President?
I don't have a pistol.
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
Who?
Sir, the deadline is today.
Can we get around this, Al?
Lincoln used it.
That was civil war.
I know it well, sir.
But O'Brien doesn't even use that office.  The Democrats've moved to Miami.  There's nothing there!
We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
Yes, you approved it, sir.
Fucking hell.
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
Just do what I say, Bob.
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
Money.  Follow the money.
The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left.
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
I believe you're right, boss.
Congratulations, boss.  A great victory!  The madman theory wasn't so crazy after all.
Because they're not Americans.
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
It's Helms -- it's got to be.
We could leverage Helms.
I promised Iran to Townsend.
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
More light, chief?
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke.
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
I can't ...
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
Mom expects great things from you ...
Diem?  Trujillo?  Lumumba?  Guatemala? Cuba? ... It's a shame you didn't take similar precautions, Dick.
I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is secure.
Current levels may not be sufficient.
What?
Mr. Castro.
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
Thank you for coming, Dick.
How about you?  Are you going to win?
Can't we just talk here?  I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
How the fuck did you know?
Why, you got a customer?
The White House.
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
She's quite pretty.
Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen.
That's right!  And if necessary, I'll drop the big one.
You'll pick up the middle on this one - the Jews and Negros.
Housecleaning?  It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ...
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you.
Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
You know, Mr. Chairman, at Harvard I used your writings in my class.
Just ... uh ... you know.
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
He was a politician.
Yes.
You know, I voted for you in your last election.
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
But it was all we had.
... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
You're shittin' me.
Where you from?
Hi.
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
I like jazz ...
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
What's in there?
POWs.  And their families.
So I'm supposed to be ...
Compassionate.  Grateful.
Proud?
Sir?
Of them.
Yes, yes.
Or we could write "expletive deleted."
We lost ...
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
Don't you want to listen to Brown's victory speech?
Amen to that.
I'll concede in the morning.
I want a divorce.
I'll do it.  No more.
Are you serious?
Yeah ... I'm out.
Dick, you should call Bobby.
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
Were you planning to tell me?
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
Do you really want this, Dick?
This.  Above all.
Yes ... you know it!  Yes ... I will. Yeah!
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
I've missed you.
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
They're all your enemies?
Yes!
Yes.
What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?
You.  What' you're doing --
And what am I doing?
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't talk to me, you ...
You can't expect me to explain that to you.
Oh, Happy!  Dick Nixon ... You remember him.
Won or lost?
Lost.
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
What?
Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  "Six Crises."
Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard.  On my staff, foreign policy whiz ...
How'd you know I was here.
Who else'd be in your truck.
You heard it?
Didn't know there was any.
Want a cup?
'Predate it.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
Yes, you've circled round.
How come're you doin that?
You don't know what he thinks.
When did he die?
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
You're discouraged.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
...I don't know what I do feel like.
Try "old" on for size.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
You ain't heard from him?
No I ain't.
Not word one.
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
It's not me he's in trouble with.
Who's he in trouble with then?
Some pretty bad people.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
You wouldn't think a car would burn like that.
...You ride Winston.
Llewelyn Moss?
That's the boy.
Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two.
That's possible.
But you don't believe it.
No. Probably I don't.
We goin' in?
What about yours?
...I believe they've done lit a shuck.
Believe you're right.
Probably must be.
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
What was the bullet?
Wasn't no bullet?
Sir, I don't want to picture that.
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
Yessir. It was punched out.
Okay.
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
...Be careful.
I always am.
Don't get hurt.
I never do.
Don't hurt no one.
Maybe I'll go ridin.
What do you think.
I can't plan your day.
I mean, would you care to join me.
...How'd you sleep?
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
Well they always is to the party concerned.
I got it Mama.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
I put it in, Mama.
No.
I ain't got the money.
I wouldn't worry about it.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
No. But I gave my word.
Not like that. Not like you say.
What's in the satchel?
It's full a money.
...Where'd you get the pistol?
Did you buy that gun?
No. I found it.
Llewelyn!
What'd you give for that thing?
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Big talk.
Yeah.
What're you doin', baby?
Goin' out.
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
Why all the way to Del Rio?
Promise?
Mama's gonna raise hell.
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
Llewelyn?
Yes ma'am?
You are comin back, ain't ya?
Llewelyn?
Hey.
What makes you say that?
She'll be all right.
Why would I let you do that?
I know where the money is.
If you knew, you would have it with you.
I know something better.
Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?
You mean the nature of this conversation?
Yessir?
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Did you go up to his trailer?
Where does he work?
I can't say.
Hello?
Is Llewelyn there?
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
What's this about?
Mm-hm.
...Where's the transponder?
...You getting anything on this?
Not a bleep.
How'd you find it?
Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time.
What airport would you use.
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
Airport.
Well -- where ya goin'?
...You need to talk to me.
I don't need to talk to you.
Why would I care where you're going.
...I know where you are.
Yeah. I know where you're going.
All right.
You know she won't be there.
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
...Me?
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
How much?
Sixty-nine cent.
This. And the gas.
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
What way would that be?
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
Didn't mean nothin'.
...Will there be somethin' else?
Is somethin' wrong?
With what?
Will there be anything else?
You already asked me that.
Well... I need to see about closin'.
See about closing.
Yessir.
What time do you close?
...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.
I could come back then.
Well... I need to close now --
Yes I do.
You married into it.
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
Call it.
Call it?
Yes.
For what?
Everything.
You stand to win everything. Call it.
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
Uh-huh. Double ought.
Tent poles.
Uh-huh.
You already have the tent?
Never mind.  I want a tent.
What kind of tent?
One room, one night.
That's twenty-six dollars.
Good. I need everything else.
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
I want you to take me to another motel.
Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em.
When did you last see him.
How well do you know Chigurh.
Well enough.
That's not an answer.
...I'm wondering...
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
I'm sorry.
You tell me the option.
The what?
...You pick the option with the applicable rate.
Could I get another room.
Half.
What else then?
Then you'll like me.
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
I know how he found me.
Not that way.
Not any way.
Took me about three hours.
I been immobile.
I'm retired.
What did you do?
Cast iron?
Yes.
I don't mean braze.
I didn't say braze.
Pot metal?
What did I say?
Were you in Nam?
Yeah. I was in Nam.
Why would he go to Odessa?
What product.
The heroin. You don't have it.
No I don't have it.
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
You do, I reckon.
I got an overcoat on.
Are you jackin' with me?
No sir.
Yes sir.
Are you in the service?
No sir. I'm a veteran.
No... Friends from the diner maybe?
...I meant your food.
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
Junior year!
Anyway, so what?
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
We think we know where Betty is.
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
I know that...
What about it?
Any idea where it is?
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
Need something else?
No, I was just... How you doing?
Great. Good. Content...
They're fine... you miss it?
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
Do you know who I am?
...I... I know what you are.
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
I better go check on them.
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
It's all right.
What?
The LeSabre!
Maroon.  I stole it.
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
Yeah, me too.
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
Are you and Larry happy?
All the time...
Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
Do what?
I gotta go.
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
Oh, you mean Fred.
Why do they keep calling you George?
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
Lyla's very nice.
She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
I have... did it sound that bad?
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
...like the water purifiers?
I got you, Del...
...well, then you ain't got much.
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
Roy! What are you doing here?
You're in serious danger!
So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
Where you headed, Betty?
Did you love it?
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
No. Loma Vista.
How did you know?
What's his real name?
Dr. David Ravell.
Like Rome?
Worse.
Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
She called you 'George,' George.
What are you doing?
He has no heartbeat!
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
You don't sound like you're from here.
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
So why'd you come to L.A.?
It's something I had to do. For David.
I got this apartment with a guy.
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
How many men have I talked to?
You said in L.A., anything goes.
Guess who I saw today.
What? Where was he?!
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
Looking for someone?
Were you with him this whole time?
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
He is real.
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
Are you sure I can borrow this?
You should have a little faith in people.
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
...this is your sweater, right?
Where are you going?
What?! That you had something to do with it?
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
Blake, I can handle that transplant!
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
More than you know. Is there anything else?
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
The fuck you talking about?
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
Really. And where was that, old man?
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
If we're for real?
Could you give us an example?
You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
Bourbon, little water, thank you.
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
Relax, we brought the cash.
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
He told us it's in the Buick.
We don't know which Buick, do we?
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
We can live with that.
Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
Should I kill him now?
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
Joyce was screwing Del.
Betty, Betty, Betty...
Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too.  Very, very impressive...
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
I know that.
That was a really shitty thing to do.
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
How'd they describe her?
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
Where? Where is she?
I'm not telling.
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
So you believed the bartender. Why?
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
Who's this?
It just didn't fit her profile...
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
...and how long did she work here?
Seems like a nice place.
Really?
Jesus Christ!
He's waiting...
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
We know that...
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Yeah? The sport utility?
Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too.
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
You lie, motherfucker...
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
Her show?
Mr. Campbell?
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
We ain't gonna make it walkin'.
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
That's right!
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
...Pete?
We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
What do we do now, Everett?
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
Four hundred, Delmar.
I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
...I'm not sure that's Pete.
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
'N turned into a frog -
Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!
I'm sayin' we har this man away.
What's his name again?
You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
Finest governor we've ever had in M'sippi.
Them straw polls is ugly.
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Latch right on to that tit.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Devil his due.
Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Pullin' ah pants down...
Helluva idea.
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
Not out the other side his face, though.
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
It's just a symbol, honey -
That's not my ring.
- in the gods - Huh?
That's not my ring.
Not your...
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
Well, I'm sorry honey -
Uh-huh.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
Yes, but honey -
I counted to three, honey.
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
Who was fixing to betray us!
You didn't know that at the time!
So I borrowed it till I did know!
Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's been saved!
A million dollars.
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
It was a moment a weakness!
...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...
Two weeks! That don't do me no good!
Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan.
I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
Who's the honcho around here?
Now what can I do you for, Mister French?
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
Daddy!
That's a maiden name.
It's bona fide!
She's at the five and dime.
You, Zack?
I been calling for four months.
What for?
Okay, okay. You win.
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I.
So what're you doing in Seattle?
Who gave you this idea?
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
Good morning, girls.
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
Yes, Joe.
When did this happen?
He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?
What's your name, boy?
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
I want to fly jets, sir!
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
Mayo, are those your friends?
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
I know.
See you in the fleet, sir!
Hi, son.
What did you call me?
What did you call me, boy?
I called you Sarge.
No.
No, sir!
No, sir.
No, sir.
Where are you from, boy?
What did you call me, Mayo?
Yes, sir!
Is your brother a flyer?
He was. He died.
Vietnam?
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
Something tells me you've been here before.
You're sure it's okay?
I'm a little late, that's all.
Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
Sid, there's no baby.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
That was you guys, huh?
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
Everything was different.
You serious about having him over?
No. I never feel like that.
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
You got a girl?
Not me.
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
I vote for the motel.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
He didn't give you much choice.
There's always a choice.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
I know who you are and what you want.
What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?
I forgot to thank you for breakfast.
That was great.
I'll get it if you want.
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
What's the matter?
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Hi.
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
I'm looking for Sid.
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
Why?
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
You told us it would grow out an inch.
Could you believe those girls!
You okay?
Hey, you guys still awake?
That isn't true, is it?
Thanks for covering for me.
Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
Do you know that for sure?
You're fuckin' A we can do this.
You're welcome.
What if she called the cops?
He said open it.
You should see the look on your face.
Me.  I am.
That's right.
I have the gun.
Yes.
What?  What do you want me to do?
This is ridiculous...
Two.  Squeeze harder.
I can't just...
Okay, okay!  Okay.
Are you okay?
She's gonna handle it.
That's your problem.
The walls are steel, right?
Not that one.
We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
Fuck.
Keep your voice down.
They're not supposed to be here!
This was your department, Junior.
They're not supposed to be here!
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
I mean, right?  Isn't it?
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
What about us?  What if she has a gun?
Open it.
They're coughing.
Cell phone.
She's never coming out.
Hey.
And we're never getting in.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
Yeah, whatever.
I mean it!
Yeah?
'Bout four o'clock.
Somebody called you?
Can we come in?
What do you want?
We'd like to come in.
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
One day you will learn to respect other people's time, Lydia, one day you --
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
Could the child please stop that?
That door is a safely hazard.
That's highly inappropriate.
Watch your mouth.
Cut it back a little bit.
We're leaving.
Suit yourself.
Nobody leaves.
No cars.  Feet are faster.
How many more do we have after this?
Something's weird.
Makes me nervous.
Why?
No, Edgar Allen.
Too many stairs.
Got us in here, didn't I?
The crowd goes wild.
478...
Don't.
He's going down.
That room!
What?!
Damn it!
Can't hear a thing.
What do they want?
What do we do?
What if they get in here?
I heard you.
Feel okay?
Yeah.
Shaky?
Nope.
Chills?
"What we want is in that room."
They're coming in here, aren't they?
"Get the fuck out of my house."
Oh, please.
Are you freaking out?
Small space?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
What am I, a five year old?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
I don't know, why?
I am.  I'm here.
YOU HAVE TO!
What, what, what is it?!
Got him!
Do it.
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
No.
Call Dad!
He --
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What if I keep dropping?
Tyrone...
Alma I told you to...
What are you doing with the gun?
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
Well if anyone's gonna protect Malcolm's legacy it better be us.
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
You got to sit on Eldridge...
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
Huey!! Man you gotta check this out... You're gonna love...
Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too?
What the fuck?
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Get out of the car.
Inspector Brimmer
Hey... what the hell you doing?
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
God damn... Kid never had a chance...
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
You know it. Stay Black...
Man, fuck you!!!
Motherfucker... you stay away...
I don't know. Look around man.
Hey, this what they got you doing now?
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
Can you make a deal with them?
You want me to put a man on it?
I don't think that will be any problem...
Yes sir I was.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
Did you shoot the officers in question?
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
We need money first...
So talk...
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
We appreciate your help with this.
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
Whatever you need, I'll be there.
What's the pig's name?
Yeah, I do.
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
Maybe...
If you got something to say, say it.
What's up with you?
You got something on your mind... "brother."
We'll all get out of here together.
What?
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Where is he?.
Ain't no one seen him.
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
It's okay Mom. I'm allright.
You don't look alright.
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
You believe that?
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
No.
When?
Late summer.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
You call that a compliment?
Next time we'll bring more blankets.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
What do you mean, old and ugly?
You got me beat on both accounts.
You look well, Charlotte.
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
Excuse me?
I know that.
Do you?
Of course, I do.
Goodbye, Charlotte.
You're surrendering.
Yes, sir.
What unit?
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
My pleasure, sir.
Colonel will do.
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
That is a separate issue.
Prisoner exchange.
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
Are you going to meet with him?
If I fail, you fail.
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
Have you seen any Redcoats?
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
You're in no condition to ride.
Father...
We'd cover more ground if we split up.
Is that so?
Did your father teach you humility?
And, Corporal...  ... be careful.
How old are you?
You know how old I am.
Flanking riders?
These four wagons must be his.
Father?
You learned her lessons better than I.
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?
Granted.  Where are you going?
Don't go in there.
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
You know what happened.
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
That's right.
It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that.
I don't care.  I hate him.
A long time ago...
Thirteen years...
That's five, keep going...
... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
One of yours?
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
Who's in command?
I am, I think.
Fall, six months at the earliest.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
Don't touch him.
How many men have we seen die?
Goodbye, Francis.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
Your son, what did you name him?
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
How far away?
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
But what about Thomas?
Thank you.
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.
Gray.
I was sorry to hear about your son.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
Remember Braddock?
That bad?
Not yet, Thomas.
Put those away.
But father, they might come this way.
Father?
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
Well...I guess not.
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Please hurry.
Yes.
No-I guess not.
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
I want to look around, daddy-- may I?
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
Is he really all right?
Yes.
Because you promised.
Ellie? What's wrong?
No more chocolate chip cookies.
But don't you dare say that.
You believe in it.
I'm not tired!
Then why do I have to go to bed?
Do you swear?
Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
You need a glass?
What were you listening to?
Allman Brothers.
Not yet...how much further is it?
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
Bagged cat. What a mess.
Going to tell Ellie?
Does she love the cat?
Yes, but--
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
Is there quicksand?
You keep saying that.
This was their burying ground, Louis.
What are those for?
Doesn't look like they last long.
Don't worry about that.
Jud, why am I doing all this?
Can I have another one?
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
It's Ellie's cat.
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
Shit! Look at this mess!
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?
Leave me alone!
Let her go. It's cool.
And Buckaroo Banzai.
Gage's gone!
My God!
I think it's rather extraordinary.
That's enough of that kind of talk!
Getting there.
I got eggs down here!
You better get going, hon.
Louis, are you sure?
My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
What's in your head, boy?
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
Elizabeth goes free!
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
So how did you get off that island, anyway?
No, I really think I do.
The situation has changed.
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
Now?
Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
You have a name, missy?
Maid or not, it fits you.
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
Then why aren't you eating?
Do you not know what this is, then?
Man overboard!
I can't breathe.
Commodore, I must protest.  Pirate or not, this man saved my life.
Commodore, you can't do that!
Then I can wear men's clothing.
Ceremony?
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
I'm glad we got here in time.
If I had known --
I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
You?!
Me!
You're in league with Barbossa!
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
Drink up me hearties, yo ho ...
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
To freedom.
We'd best drop canvas, sir!
How did you get off the island?
Blast it, I'm already awake!
We're not going to just surrender!
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?  You two weren't invited?
What's your name?
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
We had time to get to know each other.
They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
You threatened Miss Swann.
You cheated.
No.
Somewhat.
Why ask me?
Because you're a pirate.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
I can get you out of here.
Agreed.
Not without my effects.
I'd die for her.
We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
Is that so?
That's not true.
I swear, you look just like him.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
What's that?
Depends.
No.
Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy.
Are you certain this is the right way?
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
No, it's not.
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
You've seen it?
Yes.
You haven't seen it.
... No.
I think he's telling the truth.
That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
He's still breathing.
Commodore --
A moment.
But --
Speak.
Wheelchair accessible.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
Something to drink, Dr. Bright?
What are you going to do to him?
Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
How apropos.
I know what you're doing.
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
It's ready now, I know it is.
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
Do you think she will give us the designs?
Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
And you still believe he's going to come here?
Why are there two ottomans?
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
Then you still love me?
It will be an ascension.
Considering what?
If you loved me like I loved you?
Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.
Where did he go?
Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.
Hey!
You don't want this.
Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs?
Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
What did security say?
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
Well, you got another problem.
Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.
I bet he hasn't read a single report we've written on the waste problem.
You were never invited to my house.
I don't believe this is happening...
Is that what Argon told you?
You're afraid of him.
Yes?
What's it smell like?
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
Sir, please try to hold still.
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
When did you...?
Been out for six months now.
Really?  What have you been doing?
Somebody has to.
The big house?
Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
Nothing really worthwhile.
Yeah, we'll see.
Daniel, give him the Trix.
Susie!  You gotta help me!
Daniel, what are you doing here?
Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
They did it to me!
... just like the mouse.
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
What happened to it?
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
We don't have time for hysterics.
Three days ago it was.
That's right.
Is something wrong?
Susan!
Look at this!
What's that supposed to mean?
Just giving credit where credit is due.
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
Just like old times.
I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
Uh oh.  I remember that temper.
What's wrong?
The nanobot... it's not here...
How far can you stretch?
What did you want my hair for?
That's pretty good.
That's going to fit me?
Did you go?
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.
Where is it?
Argon's private lab.
You saved my life.
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
We've got to get the nanobot.
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
You're not going after Argon!
I remember I was trying to help...
God, what a fight that was.
Things do change.
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
Yeah, and what might that be?
That's impossible.
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
And you have him?
I could have you fired right now.
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
What in the hell?
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
Indeed? How interesting.
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
I think I better go, Stew.
Don't mind Mother.
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
May I use your telephone?
Certainly. Right over there.
Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
Where did you get those letters?
I suppose you're going to print them?
Will you step into the library?
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
For what?
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
Of course I am Stewart.
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
I'm not going!
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
Anne, come here. Listen
Oh hello, Anne He types furiously.
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
That's an excellent idea.
Ah-ah-ah!
Mother!
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
You're the Tribune man?
Fine. Have a seat.
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
Is that so?
Yale '21, I believe.
Is that so?
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Thank you very much.
All right, all right, don't mention it.
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Oh, is that so?
Impossible. Put it on again.
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
Look, I quit!
Yeah?
Yeah.
With me you can always do business.
Gloria Golden?
Right - for the first time this year.
Well - it's only April.
Not on my own beat, no.
Well, when are you quitting?
Is that so?
What play?
My play.
Araby?
Sure.
I'm not quitting!
No?
You're my what?
What are you doing fooling around in here?
All right, outside!
I beg your pardon, sir?
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
That's a lovely dress.
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
and that
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
And the rest of us are truck horses?
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
Thanks, thanks.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
Staring at us?
My mistake - she's glaring.
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
Hello, Stew.
Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.
Been where?
To Old Madrid.
Never even been to New Madrid.
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Did who?
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
Hey, Gallagher!
Who was that?
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
A statement? Good.
I have it here.
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
You quit trying to stop anybody
Hello, Smith.
Holy jumping swordfish!
Surely, come right in.
I don't eat waffles.
Fine, but kinda thirsty.
Okay - you remember Joe
Come in, Joe. It's all right.
Some bicarbonate - quick!
Double-strength!
Are the cars ready?
Smythe, you've been drinking.
With pleasure, Madame!
Have you seen this? 
Yes - the worm!
What's going on here? Who is this woman?
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
Well done, sir. Very neat.
Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.
Shhh! Do you hear something?
Yes, sir.
Me, sir?
Yes, sir.
Found no skeletons?
No, sir.
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!
Mary Sue?
What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
What?
It doesn't matter.
No. I want to know.
... Sex.
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Oh no ... I'm fine.
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
Have you got any make up?
Does it look okay?
Looks just like it did.
And they won't be able to tell?
Wait.
Thank you.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
Thanks ... I love you.
Oh, hello Betty.
Oh, hi ...
I'm sorry ...
I just thought ... It's beautiful.
Having kind of a tough time.
I think it looks nice.
Where'd you get this?
Bud brought it to me.
Bud?
Wait ...
I've got to go ...
It's alright. Let me see.
What is that?
You can't go out there.
Like a drum.
I told you where I was.
I told you, George. I'm not going.
Sure you are.
Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.
It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
It goes away ... It'll go away.
Where are you gonna go?
I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
Really Biff? The keenest?
But where would we go?
... Lover's Lane.
Sure is pretty.
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
It is?
Mary Sue--C'mon ...
What are you doing?
It's six-thirty ...
So.
Oh.  I can't.
I'm busy.
Don't! Just let go.
What?
I don't believe it.
She won't go out with me?
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
But it could happen.
Want some bridge mix?
Oh, no thanks ...
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
Rain.
Did you do this?
Do you know that it's illegal?
It's like the basketball team.
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
You're not allowed to lie.
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
And where's that?
What's outside of Pleasantville?
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
Hello Bud.
Hello Mr. Simpson.
Hear your Dad got a new car.
Mr. Simpson ...
No, not that hedge. The other one.
What are you doing?
Pleasantville Marathon?
Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
Lemme see that.
Get lost!
Oh my God.
What happened?
What did you do?
Oh God.
I don't believe this.
I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.
I still don't see why we're doing this.
You know him?
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
Does he--you know--like "me"?
Those are my friends.
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
Can we do any better?
What were you doing in a library?
It's in your closet.
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
He won't notice anyway.
They don't notice that kind of thing.
So what's the point?
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
You have no right to do this.
Well if I don't who will?
Me too. Sounds swell.
It's okay.
Not directly anyhow ...
Nothing.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Are you sure?
I told you. I'm like positive.
This thing works. We could go home right now.
You got the admissions letter.
Right here.
That was sure swell ...
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
No. I baked them for you.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
Hi.
Sure ... Where would we go?
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
So what's it like?
What?
Yeah.
You want some berries?
What's going on?
Rain.
Real rain?
What do we do?
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
Can I open it?
Where are they?
You're gonna forget about me.
I like calling you David.
Scout?
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
... Like Prince Charming.
McIntire's.
Why would I do that?
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
Hello there.
... Hi.
I can't.
Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
I want a word with you ...
Oh--well ...
I didn't do anything wrong.
No you're not.
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
OW!
Why?
Just gimme the damn remote!
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
I'm going on trial tomorrow?
I'm so glad you're here.
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Do you have the lettuce?
... Yeah.
Have you cooked the burgers?
Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
Bud ...
Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.
Forget about that!
You know what I really like?
... What's that?
Oh, hi.
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
It's beautiful.
TV repair.
TV repair?
Yeah. TV busted?
Yeah ...
Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.
What happened?
Hey.
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
Cool.
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
Yeah but what are you doing?
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
...yes I'm still on hold...
What city?
Somewhere in Utah.
What's the listing?
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
Hello.
So you're coming tonight, right?
Well I don't want to do something like that.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
That's your fault not mine.
She's really cute and she's really nice.
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
I'm trying to be your friend.
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
You just said very food.
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
No.
You look nervous.
Yeah I can't.
I have work, I can't leave.
It's not cool?
It's fine, but --
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
I feel really on the spot now.
Are you gonna do it?
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
Yeah I can't.
What's all this pudding?
It's not mine.
Why's it here?
Goodbye.
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
No she didn't; that's a lie.
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
Hello, this is Back.
Hi, is this Jack?
Yes.
This is Georgia.
Hi. This is Jack.
I'm just laying on my bed.
Where are you?
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
Do you like porno movies?
Yeah? So what are you doing, then?
...just talking to you....
Are your pants off?
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
No.
You have a girlfriend?
...yes...
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
...yeah....well you have me now.
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
I'm fine. Who is this?
Georgia.
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
You're going to work now?
Can I ask you a question?
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
You don't even know how much it is.
I know but I....how much is it?
Really? Please?
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.
So you think you can?
Hello?
This makes me very uncomfortable.
-- you said you did.
I know I did. But I don't.
You lied to me?
Why did you tell me you did, then?
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
I have to go.
No.
They're not open yet?
I don't know.
Hi.
Business is good, you're busy?
Yeah, not really.
Do you have brothers or sisters?
-- well, if you're gonna go --
This is funny.
Alright?
Who is it?
How long have you known her?
About six months.
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
Yeah.
You see?
So that was your pudding?
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
No I didn't say that.
Is everything ok?
Yes.
What happened?
Nothing.
What did he want?
There's a better place for us to eat.
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
...yes I did...?
Are you learning how to play it?
Yes? I'm trying.
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
If you come to Hawaii --
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
You don't think you'll go --
This is Barry.
This is Lena.
Really?
That was good.
Yeah.
I don't freak out very often.
...I don't know what you mean....
I don't freak out.
Ok.
Have a good trip.
Hello?
Lena?
Yeah?
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
About six months ago. Why?
I just wanted to make sure.
Where you married?
Ok. So you were married for how long?
Yeah......yeah.....
Do you wanna have sex?
Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.
This is funny.
Where do you have to go?
For what?
How many times have you been on an airplane?
Yeah.
It's ok to ask that.
Are you ok?
I'm fine are you ok?
Yes I'm sorry.
What is this?
You left me at the hospital.
I'm sorry.
You can't do that.
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
If you wanted to call me back I could...
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
Ok.
Ok, bye, bye.
Yeah.
Did you do it?
No.
Well who did?
I don't know.
You're hand is bleeding.
I cut myself.
How?
I didn't do that.
Why? ...what?
Your hand is bleeding.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
Please don't do this to me.
Hi, this is Janice The Operator, who's this?
Hello, how are you?
Hi, is this your first time calling?
......and this is confidential?
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
And your name?
Barry Egan.
And your Social Security number.
It's ok, take your time.
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
No one will know your name.
Can you say that my name is Jack?
You want her to call you Jack?
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt.
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
That's that.
Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....
Sorry about that.
How many sisters do you have?
How you doin' Barry?
Hi Walter.
That was weird. I meant good.
What's up?
Well I'm sorry. Before...
Fine, thank you.
It takes time to process --
Hey, good morning, Barry.
Hey...Lance....can I.....
You ok?
Yes I'm fine.
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
Why is it here? Barry....Barry?
Good morning, Barry....
So what should I do with the pudding?
WHICH?
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
Yeah.
Hey.
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
How much money do you have in your pockets?
What do you have in the house?
You have an ATM?
Yes.
Is this where you live?
I'm sorry.
Are you serious with this?
Yes. Sorry.
This is a bunch of bullshit.
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
Are you going to the party tonight?
Yes I am.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
Seven o'clock.
You can't be late.
I won't.
I'm serious.
I know.
Ok.
You can't be late though.
I know.
Seriously.
I know.
Yeah but I'm serious.
Ok.
I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.
That's cool.
When can you leave?
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
Ok.
So they'll go.
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
What did you say?
Nothing.
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
I'll go pay for my car.
Are you sure?
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
I'm sorry. You're right.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
Should I call you later?
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
He's a writer, not a madman.
If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
At your service, Count.
"To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --"
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
Madeleine --
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
By whom? The Marquis?
What? What've I done?
Free his mouth.
Mustn't do that, sir.
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?
Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --
But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
Enough to discern its tenor.
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
You mean to take us all down with you?
He can't do that to me.
I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
I have a proposition.
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
Good day, Marquis.
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
What on earth would that require?
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
Coulmier, you animal!
Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
I saw the longing in your eye --
-- that was lust --
Don't confuse one organ with another --
I know, because I felt it myself --
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
AND DID YOU?
Who's to say I did not?
Was it impotence?
NEVER!
Abbe de Coulmier!
His wife's influence.
Oh. That.
You have to believe me, I had no idea --
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
And --?
It was fiction, of course.
Of course.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
And my own.
How is the patient faring?
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
I'll be waiting.
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
Yes?
I'm only a laundress; not a detective.
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
I'm hungry for a proper visit.
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
Most assuredly.
Is it terribly erotic?
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
Surely you've seen a man naked.
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
It's tainted money, Doctor.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
Oh, but I am!
I am eternally in your debt.
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
You've come to lecture me?
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
Leave at once --
But it's just begun --
Doesn't that please you?
I'd rather read, thank-you.
Ever met Walter Winchell?
No, when I was but a tender lad--
So you ever gonna do a picture?
I wonder sometimes.
You're just scared.
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
God, these parties are the worst
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
I can't
Sure you can, just--
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
Who are you, sir?
The actor
Louis
You know that can't happen.
Oh, why is that?
Why is that, Louis?
Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!
How bad is it?
How much?
It's not really--
We're 125 million dollars in debt?
This picture--
Then you explain it to me?!
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
You needn't use that language with me
I wanted it
There's a different between want and
You will not walk out on me
You are repellant when you drink.
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
I will not have this in my home.
Thank you for your time
Sir, I-
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
Keep filming.
We're using-
Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture
You drink at 10 am, do you?
No -- no -- I mean--
He personally asked you to?
Hearst?
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
Can I talk to Hearst?
What are movies about, Orson?
Forget it-
Telling stories.
Nope.
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
Like a bug.
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
Manolete?!
Who the hell's Manolete?
The great Spanish bullfighter
The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!
Yes.
Please don't say this.
So speaks the court jester.
Fuck you
I expected more from you.
Let me out.
Listen to me-
So, who is he? We have to know him.
Why her?
It's 350 pages long.
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
Craig is one syllable
Uh huh.
I want you back
I'm sorry.
Hedy Lamarr?
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
Shit
Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
To do what?
That's for me to decide.
You talked to New York?
Yes
Yes
CITIZEN KANE
Pardon?
Please don't ask me to do this.
For the title
This is an abomination There's no music and--
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
You're not still mad at me, I hope
Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
I think you better sit down
It was fun, wasn't it?
It was the best, kid
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
Orson, you wanna take five?
How 'bout a real drink?
We done?
Oh, no--
Yes!
He's Christ?
Let's go, Jake, wake up!
Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
They wanna talk to you.
Hey champ!
Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
Aside from everything else, your family all right?
Believe what you want.
This looks done.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
Where you going at this hour?
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
And where you goin'?
What's wrong?
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
Yeah. Do me a favor.
Sure. What is it?
Hit me in the face.
You want me to do what?
Jack, I got no gloves.
Harder.  Take the towel off.
Jack! Enough!
Answer me when I talk to you.
Who's that?
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
Huh?
You wasn't with her?
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
Do you see her yet?
You want the title shot?
Say what you're gonna say.
You want the title shot or not?
Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
Stick out your hands, Jake.
C'mon, Joey.
Except fall down like a normal person.
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
Screw you, Jack.
What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
Why didn't you tell me about it?
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
No, I just told you what happened.
Whatever you touched, that's good now.
Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
What do you mean, "you"?
What?
But you said "you."
Whadda ya mean?
Did you ever fuck my wife?
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.
What time is it?
Nine o'clock.
At night?
How many pounds I gotta lose?
He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.
You don't talk very much.
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
It feels real good.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Should I hit it?
Can you see it?
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
Jake...
You said never to touch you before a fight.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
Take off my pants.
Jake...
I like the gym smell.
Now, touch me...  ...here.
Joey's right. Janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking...
Who asked you?
But, Jake, I was just...
Who asked you?
I was just...
What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
I'm not interested in him.
You're not interested in him?
Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
What?
You asleep?
Yeah.
Huh?
What did I say?
That he's got a pretty face.
I never noticed his face.
But Jake... I didn't say anything...
I went out.
Where you been all day?
I took the kids to my sister's.
I called. You weren't there.
What'd you see?
I went to the movies.
What'd you see?
"Father of the Bride."
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.
You did?
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
Jake --
No, not that.
Then what?
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
Why don't you just call him?
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
I'm leaving you Jake.
Are you drunk?
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
Hi, Tommy. How are you?
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
Never felt better.
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
How's the weight? Ok?
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
All right, I'll try. See you later.
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
This is the baby sitter.
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
He has it. Thank you.
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
Jefferies?
Name me a better photographer.
Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
His wife took a trip.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
I think they missed their chance with her.
She never left the apartment --
-- until yesterday morning.
What time?
I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
Feel a little foolish?
Who said they left then?
Who left -- where?
How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
Did you ever own a saw?
But I'm not a killer!
This is Doyle, Jeff.
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
Congratulations, Jeff.
For what?
For getting rid of that cast.
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
Gunnison?
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
It's me.
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
Hello.
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
I can't. The police have it by now.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
I predicted it.
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
You've got a hormone deficiency.
I knew it!
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
She expects me to marry her.
That's normal.
I don't want to.
She's just not the girl for me.
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
What about this morning? Any developments?
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
A Federal offense.
Huh?
I'm just going to get the name of their truck!
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
Thank heaven that's over!
I wonder.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
What are you two talking about?
Got a shovel?
There's probably one in the basement.
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
Smart girl.
Smart? She'll be arrested!
What do you need money for?
One hundred and twenty-seven.
How much do you think you'll need?
Hello.
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
Not yet, Jeff.
You haven't even heard from him?
It is something really important, Jeff?
Goodnight, you idiot.
How's your leg?
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
And your stomach?
Empty as a football.
And you love life?
Anything else bothering you?
The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
Something big going on somewhere?
Big enough?
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
What a day I've had!
Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
You can't buy that kind of publicity.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
I wish there was one I wanted.
Make the one you want.
You mean leave the magazine?
Yes.
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever I have a few minutes after lunch.
You don't think either one of us could ever change?
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
You mean "goodnight."
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
Don't you ever have any problems?
I have one now.
So do I.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
What do you think?
You'd better before you catch the disease!
Maybe she died.
Lisa, please!
It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
What's the apartment house number?
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
To get on home.
I wonder where he's going now?
I don't know.
Something on your mind, Lisa?
It doesn't make sense to me.
What doesn't?
Women aren't that unpredictable.
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
We have all -- what?
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
I have the whole weekend off.
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
From his landlord -- once a month.
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
I do?
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
I hate funny exit lines.
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
I'll rephrase the question.
Is he cleaning house?
Wasn't that close?
Shut up. I'm all right.
L. B. Jefferies.
What's that?
A new disease.
Friend of yours?
I'm glad they let you out.
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
Feel okay?
What's happening?
You know something?
What?
Hey, he's real abstract and different.
Meaning me?
What?
Machismo?
Where can we meet?
Just him.
Jim Stark.
Hi.
Sure.  It's fine.
Yeah.
I like you, you know?
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
We heard firing.  He get anybody? You alone?
How'd he get in?
Smashed the front door.
Any other entrance?
You see any cops?
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
I think I should go home.
No.  We're going to bring him down.
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
What time is it?
Hang loose.  We got all night.
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
Tell him why we moved here.
Hold it, Jim.
Mother--
So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
You thought I was Mom?
And you dropped it?
Yeah!  Shh!
You awake?
Is there some kind of trick answer?
How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
Will you let him tell it!
I don't think so--
Except yourself!
Will you wait a minute?
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.
Excuse us a minute?
Have some cigars.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
You sure?
He's just loaded, honey.
Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
Frank?  I'm frightened.
He's home.  I heard the car.
See?  It stopped.
Who's there?  Anyone there?
Is he there?
John Crawford?
Yes, sir.
Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
Where did you get the gun?
Come back tomorrow.
Hi.
Hi there.
You remember me?
No.  I don't think so--
Boy!
You shouldn't monkey with him.
What's your name!
Jim.  What's yours?
You scared?
I just don't want trouble.
I'm here.
Are you really going to meet them?
Who knows.  Plato?
What?
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
Jim!
Who's that!
It's me!
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
They're looking for you!--
Judy.
Hey where'd you go?
I'm here.  Shut up.
Come out come out wherever you are!
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?
What?
There's only one key.
We'll take it!
Man, you're schizoid!
Isn't he schizoid?
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
I came here before.
You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!
Plato?
I've got a gun.
That's swell.  How are you?
No.  At dawn.
Can I keep it?
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
Why?
They like you.  Okay?
Who's that?
Just a guard.
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
I'm sorry.
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
'Bye, Mom.
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
What's that got to do with it?
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
Get lost.
Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
Leave me alone.
No.
He called me chicken.
And your folks didn't understand?
They never do.
What a zoo!
Pretty mixed up?
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Hi.  I saw you before.
Bully for you.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
Now that's true!
Who lives?
Won't mother be proud.
Where's Dawson High School?
You going there?
Yeah--why--
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
The kids take me.
A what?
Goodbye!  See you!
It doesn't matter to them.
You were looking for me, weren't you?
You still pretty upset?
Why?
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
Why did you do that?
I felt like it.
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
You can trust me, Judy.
Well--we're newlyweds.
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
You can't talk underwater!
Ever been in a place like this before?
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
I don't know.
Hi.
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
You don't need to do that.
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
What?
You smell like baby powder.
So do you.
No!
Is he your friend?
Yes.  My best friend.
Hi, Plato!
Judy--we're ready for you now.
He hates me.
What?
He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
I'll never get close to anybody.
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
She's being called for.
You said you'd call my father.
We were romantic then too--
Are you and Mom home tonight?
Good evening.
Didn't you forget something?
I was talking to Dad.
I guess I just don't understand anything.
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
Must have a way with stationery.
Gabriel, let him go --
Read a lot about you, Nick.
What are you doing here?!
Gabriel!
A man of some travels.
Is this him!?
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
He wants the money.
He wants... your "sister"...
To all those cons...
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
Toys for... adults?
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
Gotta be ten degrees out there.
Radio said negative five.
I don't think it's negative five.
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
No, hey, I like your coat --
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
No --
One more. Smile. One more.
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
You need a COAT!
Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
You forget where I work?
Beauty and fragrances.
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
We could live it up and --
I'll see what I can do.
NO!
You motherfucker.
Nick, no --
You sold him out.
Nick, I love you --
Get the hell off of me!
He'll kill you.
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
Nick, please, it's me --
You told him about Nick's letters.
No, Nick, no --
You're in on this.
Gabriel!
He working for them on this one?
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
Get your own room, Ashley.
Nick...
That guy knows you?
We get to the bridge, we're all right!
We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
Don't say my name...
I love you, Nick...
They'll have guns.
I don't know...
He wants to see your map.
I'm almost done.
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
They all are. Football's on.
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!
You... you... YOU --
I saved your life.
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
But I never said Rudy.
You said it a million times!
No, you can't --
You're not Nick Mason...
I shared his cell!
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
Wish I had a brother like you.
Where's she work?
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
What's her middle name?
Bam Bam.
What'd they call her in college?
What college.
Be more specific.
A station wagon in Canada.
What's her greatest fear?
Her brother.
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
You knew the place --
I don't know.
The hell you don't.
I did.
This isn't the Tomahawk.
We walked the place for a week.
They won't recognize me.
Why not.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
Bring back some memories, Nick?
Rather be back in the Mountain?
Might as well be.
Do I get a country-western name?
You got one hour.
Got something to say to me, Nick?
What'd you tell that casino manager?
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
Six men means six guns.
No way.
I'm no threat without a gun.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
You gotta be kidding me.
Can't be attracting attention, right?
Ash?
...so where is he?
I can't go back to Vegas...
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
What about the Powwow Safe?
Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas the season...
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
Cancer-sucker.
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
Thanks, sister. How are ya.
Fuckin' freezing.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
Five years. Since it opened.
How long ago was your makeover?
Having romance problems, Romeo?
How do we take them out?
You gotta get someone upstairs.
Here's my present to you, truck drivers --
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
You knew there were guns in here!
Monsters in the gelatin...
It's a roach, guy --
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!
Haven't thought about it.
Ain't there yet.
Three days, man.
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
I'm just talking.
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Don't move, Rudy!
GUARD! GUARD!
Alamo...
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
GUARD!!!
Ash... Ashley...
No, man! No, no, no!
Tell Ashley... I...
YOU TELL HER!
NO!!!
...for Christmas...
I... sorry, Mister...
That was my king!
POP! That was My card!
But... I had a five...
Switch seats with me.
There is no other table --
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
Start talkin
That's what it looks like!
Map is kinda dirty, Monster...
Alone at last.
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
How ya doin', Toothpick?
You ain't dying, he is.
I'll call somebody.
Where was she from, Compton?
The motherfucker killed Vic.
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.
Daddy, did ya see that?
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
What? Nobody set anybody up.
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
Who, Mr. White?
Did the two of you talk?
Me and Mr. White?
Yeah.
A little.
What about?
The Brewers.
Didja use the commode story?
What's this?
But what is this?
I'm sorry.
It's a change.
Sure.
Who's your parole officer?
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
Mr. Blue's dead?
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
Sorry, it's my book now.
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
What for?
What's the cut, poppa?
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
Don't ask me that.
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
I know.
You do?
Your name's Freddy something.
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
What're you talkin' about?
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
Follow you where?
Down to my car.
Why?
For what, the cops?
You didn't ask.
I'm okay.
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
C'mon, throw in a buck.
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
I don't believe in it.
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
Want a smoke?
That's not correct.
A few cops.
No real people?
Uh-uh, just cops.
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
How can you be so sure?
I got the diamonds.
Where?
I got 'em, all right?
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
So, is he dead or what?
He ain't dead.
So what is it?
Well, he knows a little about me.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
Is that supposed to be funny?
I told ya he'd be pissed.
Not these guys.
Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
Who shot who?
What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
It doesn't matter who they are.
And this is Helen Carter.
Yes, ma'am.
As far as -- Sonora?
Our kind of women?
And this is Helen Carter.
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
There's a nice boy.
Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
They're stragglin'.
So that was why she tried to run away.
Hold on.
We can't stay here!
I'll make the soap myself.
But the rest is right.
He knows his alphabet.
Are we leaving?
You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
Maybe it's better that way.
Tell me, darling.
What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
All my clothes --
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
I found their surrey --
I -- lost something.
Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
How does she draw?
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
What was he in jail for?
In a fight?
Yes.
At the ranch maybe?
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
Where'd they go?
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
Finished, son?
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
I didn't stop to think, Clay.
All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
Is that the only reason you came back?
Sure. What other reason would there be?
How's that?
All right, you didn't know.
I can't take her with me.
You're not bein' quite fair.
All right, you didn't know.
I can't take her with me.
You're not bein' quite fair.
I said I didn't care.
Don't act so -- crazy.
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
Stop it -- stop it.
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
You got no business snoopin' around --
What is it?
Just a thing I was workin' on.
Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
That sure smells good.
What's the matter -- restless?
Yes, people make me restless.
Even women?
There aren't any women here.
And you're all alone.
Suppose I take a look.
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
Goodbye and thanks.
I tried my best, but these things take time.
And we're running out of that.
How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
He certainly could. About a month.
You're not giving up?
Maybe I better start working on him.
Go on. Have another try at him.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
Everybody knows --
Clay Phillips.
How far up the trail?
We got to get movin'.
Because there's a man I want to see.
We got company. Female company.
Why, yes. They're all I need...
What are you doin' --
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
I sure would.
You're so nice.
Good night, Miss Wells.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
Aren't we stayin'?
That's the end of the line.
And that's tough, isn't it?
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
No.
You were supposed to be reading words.
She was only teasin'.
Oh, sure.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
I think he wants me.
No, I won't let you do it.
Hey, Brenda.
Me, too. 101?
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
My favorite memory was when we --
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Really? That's amazing.
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
It's coming!
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
Cindy, what's going on?
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
Ray, have you been here all this time?
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
No, stay.
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
He's right. I should go first.
So, I see you're really into spooks.
No. I never date outside my race.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
Sure. We can practice talking.
Dude, somebody's on the rag.
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Where the hell are we?
It looks like the furnace.
He's here.
Can you feel that?
Feel that?
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
There's something I really want to share with you.
I know, but I've been thinking --
Listen to me I --
Listen to me I --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
Then what are we going to do?
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
What should we get?
I don't care. You pick.
Are you okay?
Okay, I get the point.
So, whatever happened to her?
Let her go, Cin.
It's the sequel.
How about these buns?
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
I'm Cindy.
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
Stop! --
This can't be happening?
Noooo!!!
What the hell are you doing?
What are we gonna do?
Father!
My child, you're alive!
Yes, we made it!
My child you are the only survivor.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
So, do you think you made it into the class?
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
Yo! That jacket is tight.
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
Aww, the little bird died.
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
That was a great idea, Shorty.
Hey, y'all! What's going on?
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.
I take it you're not mad at me.
I don't like this, this...
I finished all the interviews.
Let me see the files.
Let me help you.
Here you go, Professor.
I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
In about fifteen minutes.
Right. What about condoms?
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
Professor, I think you should see this.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
The image there.
Professor, we need to talk.
Hello Dwight.
What are you working on?
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
She's right. We should stick together.
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
Alright... I might need your help.
A little bit... Give me your belt.
You're not wearing a belt.
You mean to tell me we're dead!
Uh... I'm Father McFeely
It's okay. I understand.
Would you like to see the girl?
Yes.
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
No thanks.
Father, I think you should rest.
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
Yo son, check this out.
Sorry, y'all. My bad.
I woke up naked, too.
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
What does it say?
It says, "Ray."
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
"Fucked me."
"Ray!"
"Fucked me."
"Ray!"
BLOOD FEAST!
Hi, Mom.
Oh, boy! 
Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.
Did you hear?
Mrs. Sutphin?
Mother? 
0h, shit!
You don't think...
...Jenner... Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson. 3511 Clark Avenue!
Bring her home... I guess.
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
Here we go again.
Hi!
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her!  Should she be the next victim?
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?
Carl's a jerk!
No comment!
Sorry, ma'am.
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
Why?
Because it's the rules!
Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
Chip, honey?
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
I'm so happy I could shit.
CHIP!!
In here, Mom...
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
You mean for TV or print?
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
That's nice.
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
Goodnight, honey.
We can be real quiet...
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
Oohhhh, Eugene!
Shhhh..
Oooohhhh.
Don't wake the kids...
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house. 
Contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
"P" as in...
Objection! Argumentative!
Hello.
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
I beg your pardon?
What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
MOTHERFUCKER!!
It's not fair!!
Dottie! Watch what you're doing!
Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
So you do drink?
Socially... I'll have a beer.
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
Who wants fruit salad?
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... 
And who may I ask is Carl?
He killed people, Mom.
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
Yes... but... I didn't...
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
Mrs... Sutphin?
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
He's a good boy.
What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
Man, that one made me puke!
You forgot something...
Are we leaving?
SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
Murder, honey.
What was that?
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
What's he know?
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
Yes, ma'am, it is.
I'll give you fifty cents.
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
You think my sister is there?
You can't tell.
I don't like this.
You scared?
Yes.
Let's get out of here.
It's only a little way, Mr. August.
We can't stand here all night.
Drink.
Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
I've come from Jacqueline. She needs money.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
She could use a hundred dollars.
I'll give you a check.
I haven't got that much in cash.
How much have you got?
But tell me --
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
Why, Mary --
Hello, Frances.
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
She's a pretty good sort.
Do you know what this is, Frances?
What did she want?
I did her hair.
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
And that was all?
No. She asked about the trademark.
What did she want to know?
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
Thank you.. .goodnight.
But you do believe me?
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
The people at the restaurant?
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -
 What have you done about Irving August?
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.
I know  I shouldn't have told you
Do you think he knows about this?
Let her know what?
She'll have to know some time.
Who are you?
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
And then?
I don't know.
You'll be all right?
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
I have been at the library.
Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
I had begun to write again -that's whet I was doing when you came in.
It's because of Jacqueline  I can't go on looking for her --
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
And the other was Judd?
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
Following me to find Jacqueline?
And this poetry  like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
Wait - there is that other favor.
Tell me where Jacqueline is - we've got to find her.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
Yes. When I tell you.
Would they hurt her?
I haven't said anything of the sort.
But you would like to know where she is?
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
Is it about Jacqueline?
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
I'm afraid not.
Yes.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
I'll be out in a minute.
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
She's not been here for a long time.
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
That makes it all the more difficult 
Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
But she told him, Frances. She told him about us.
I have taken care of Mary. I've spoken to her. She's going back to school.
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell -
Ann?
Yes?
That was quick.
False alarm.
Television?
Yes.
No. Why?
Oh, uh-huh.
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
Nine years.
This food is excellent.
Mother, father, sister.
Sister older or younger?
I don't know.
What's the first?
Would you mind?
No.
So what about kids?
You're what?
My therapist said that --
You're in therapy?
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
You had sex with you therapist?
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
Hi!
Are you in the middle of something?
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
What are these?
Who's Donna?
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
You went out with her?
Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.
Yes.
No.
What... what are these interviews about?
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
About sex?
Yes.
What about sex?
Everything about sex.
You just ask them questions?
Yes.
And they just answer them?
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
I don't... why... why do you do this?
I'm sorry this came up.
This is just... so...
Maybe you want to go.
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
You know?
Yes.
How did you know?
She said it on her tape.
Do you think that's such a good idea?
Don't you want to make one?
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
What will you do when the money runs out?
It won't. Are you ready?
Tell me your name.
Tell me your name.
Do you talk to him?
When we're making love?
Yes.
Sometimes. Afterward.
Is he going to see this?
I guess not.
So you do fantasize?
Yes.
About who?
I fantasized about you.
About me?
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
No.
On tape?
No.
You said you weren't always impotent.
That's correct.
So you have had sex.
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
So you lied to her?
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
Interesting analogy.
I'm babbling.
God, I m so mad at him!!
If you were in love with me, would you?
I'm not in love with you.
But if you were?
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
I can't.
Why not?
I've told you.
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
Who? Elizabeth?
But you're planning to be?
Not entirely.
Like maybe a big part?
Don't do that.
Why not?
I want to touch you.
John?
Yes. I just got busy.
Who'd you have lunch with?
Something wrong?
But I'm not.
I'm not either!!
Where did you go when you left here?
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
Goddam right.
Bastard...
You son of a bitch!!
I have thought about it, yes.
God damn you!!
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
What do you mean?
Did you masturbate?
God, no.
So it was recently that you tried this.
Is he still at your house?
No, he left last week.
Did you find him attractive?
What do you mean, like physically?
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
I hate my sister.
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
He doesn't have a phone.
But he won't.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
Will you stop? Jesus.
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
No, I didn't.
No, it's nothing like that.
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
Well, what, then?
I don't want to talk about it.
Then why'd you call me?
He just asked me questions.
Questions about sex.
Yes, I did.
Cynthia!
What!?
Why did you do that?
But why did you want to?
He wouldn't do that.
You don't know that for sure.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
Did he touch you?
In front of him, Ann, yes.
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
I don't want to discuss it.
Here it is.
What is it?
It's a sun dress.
It looks like a tablecloth.
I was just trying to --
So what's my share of the dress?
Thank you.
Bye.
I wish you'd get an answering machine.
There's a phone here.
Who are you?
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
Do I know you?
You want me to leave?
Nope.
How did you find me?
Oh, okay. I think I get it.
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
Doing what?
Talking.
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
I just want to ask you questions.
And that's all?
Would anybody else see the tape?
How do we start?
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
And you ask questions, right?
Yes.
No.
Do I sit or stand?
Whichever you prefer.
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
What did he say?
Would you like me to take my pants off?
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Do you think I'm pretty?
Yes.
Prettier than Ann?
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
Is that what he tells you?
Hello.
No.
No? Not even one more?
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
I can't talk you into it?
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
So make an exception.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
I've got to get back to the office.
Who said I was jealous?
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
No, I mean doing it at my house.
Afraid of getting caught?
I'm intrigued.
John?
Hello.
Cynthia. John.
Not today. I've got other plans.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
How about inviting me over to dinner?
John Millaney.
I want to see you.
When?
Hello.
Nothing wrong with trying.
What's so stupid about it?
I like the way he dresses.
I wish you hadn't done that.
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
I just... Ann is very...
It won't. I trust him.
Look, are we going to do it or not?
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
Who?
God, you... you're mean.
I know. Will you please leave now?
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
Plenty of room for two people.
It'll just be me.
Student?
No.  You said three-fifty?
Plus first and last month deposit.
Will you lease month-to-month?
Not for three-fifty.
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
Really. How'd it go?
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
I like having the car, the car is important.
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
Where are the tapes, Graham?
Give me your keys.
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
IBM.
May I ask who's calling?
John Millaney.
Mr. Millaney?
Mr. Millaney?
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
He said immediately.
Hi.
No, nothing.
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
Kiss, kiss?
Anything wrong?
No. I don't think so.
Well? Supper at my place?
OK. But late.
But where are you going?
Can I call you at the office?
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
Want me to breathe deeply?
Didn't seem worried about them.
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
Gonna cut me open?
Yes?
That you, Rog?
I don't get it.
He didn't make it.
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.

I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
What?
You got it!
You got it!
I know, I know, it's just...
Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
How did you come by this scenario?
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
SPONSOR!!!
Dentonvale has been sold.
Out of self comes selflessness.
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Yes, Betty.
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
Care to indulge?
Indulge?
President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT

Mental instability?
He was adopted you know.
Oh, Harry.  What are we going to do?
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
Could you tell us a little about it?
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
Could I do that later?
But they only think they're happy.
I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad.
Oh my poor baby.
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
You shouldn't have said that.
Why?
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?

Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
And none of them worked?
Isn't she lovely?
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
We love you, Baby.
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
It's Christine.  Hey you.
Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
Well, then put him at the singles table.
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
Why are you being so defensive?
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
Bye.
I love you.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
Are you there? Miles?
So I guess that's it.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
My condolences.
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
Highliner.
Glass or bottle?
Bottle.
You got it.
You okay, Miles?
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
They're just leftovers.
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Stephanie.
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
Good. How're you?
Great. You look great.  You both do.
I'm thinking about the duck breast.
What happened to you guys?
Hi.
Highliner, please.
No, I'm an actor.
Anything I'd know?
That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
I am one of those guys.
No, we're paying for the wine.
I can't help the traffic.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
Don't open that now. It's warm.
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
How old's she going to be?
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
Let me call Christine.
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
What do you smell?
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
That's what you do with every one.
You know, you could work in a wine store.
Hey Jack, hurry up!
It's not even a mile.
If that's what feels right.
It does. Feels right.
Then it's a good thing.
Yeah. Tight.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
You know her?
Sure I know Maya.
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
And she likes Pinot.
She works for tips!
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
Have you no shame?
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Nice, huh?
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
She what?  When?
About a month ago. Six weeks.
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
Get the trunk.
We're on.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Pull yourself together, man.
Where were you?
Bathroom.
Oh, boy.
She's been leaving messages here too.
You should call her.
I will.  See ya!
Right now.
What'd Christine say?
Yep.
Where is Stephanie?
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
What?
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
What? Of course I like Christine.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
Can you give me some room here?
Nice shot.
What do you think's going on?
Could be anything.
Obsessively.
What is it?
Fucker hit into us.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
Is it the money thing?
Is what the money thing?
We're on.
What exactly are we going to do?
You have to tell me --
What?
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
Do you like them?
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
Let me use your phone.
Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
Huh. Let me think.
What's it look like to you?
You know what I'm thinking?
Fucking chick's married.
We gotta go back.
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
So what's the plan?
The plan is... you go.
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
Hey, Jack. Jack.
Yep. Quite a day.
Come on, let me drive.
I'm fine. You rest.
What's wrong?
What the fuck!
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
You broke some.
Whatever. Sorry.
Well. That about does it.
Why don't you come in?
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
Love you, man.
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
You want to join us?
I finished it.
What are you drinking?
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Oh yeah? How is it?
Nice. Very nice.
Twelve months in oak.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
I'm having the salmon.
Are you all right?
Hey.
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
How long have you been into wine?
What was the bottle that did it?
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
Yeah, weird. But great.
What's the title?
"The Day After Yesterday."
Oh. You mean... today?
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Yeah? Like what?
Bathroom over there?
Good. So did I.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
I had class.
Well, nice to see you now.
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
About two-thirty.
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Oh, Maya. No.
Hello?
Victoria! How the hell are you?
Ken.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.
That was big of him.
That's great.
So what's happening with your book?
Not me. I'm not drinking.
You quit drinking?
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
How much skin and stem contact?
About a year.
French or American?
Both.
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
Sir, what are you doing?
I told you I need a drink.
So what do you think?
Oops. Sorry.
See you, Miles. You take care.
You talked to Wendy?
Miles, when are you going to get married again?
Only for pee or poop.
It makes me feel better.
Does she ever answer back?
No.
There's dust in it.
A hair.
Daddy.
I think it's contaminated.
My ballet recital.
The same windows.
I don't want you to die.
I'm scared.
Does it hurt?
I don't feel much.
...I will.
...Tell Graham --
And tell Merrill to swing away.
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
Explain, act crazy?
Curse and stuff.
I'm not going to curse.
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Just make noises then.
I cursed.
It was very dark.
It was very dark.
This guy got on the roof in like a second.
Morgan, be careful.
Yes.
How can you say that?
Yes.
What time is it?
Where are you going?
Should we turn off the lights?
This is going to do nothing.
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
He was only a year and half old.
We won't be able to get out of there.
Merrill --
Merrill!
They're distracting us?
I can feel air.
Me too.
It's getting stronger.
That's good enough for me.
Don't touch him.
Graham.
Yes.
It needs batteries.
These are D's; I need double A's.
It's still making the noises. It's broken.
I'm getting out now.
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
Bimboo?
Dad.
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
Where are we going to sleep?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Stop crying!
They'll read our minds!
Did someone save me?
It's the strangest thing Father.
Don't call me Father.
The footprints.
What about them?
Second thing this week I can't explain.
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
He definitely wasn't a midget.
Okay.  So he was tall?
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
She's not in an ambulance Father.
Is that him?
Don't do it!
What book!
Emmett! Am I glad to see you!
All I did was kiss a girl.
No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
What friend is that?
I think we lost 'em.
Emmett.
I didn't know you were out.
Sounds good.
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
...Gotta go...
Where are we?
You'll never make it.
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
I almost didn't.
McKendrick's men got him.
Gotta go.
The Parkers seem like nice folks.
They've been kind to me.
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
Are you all right?
This is a brutal land.
You must have known that before you came.
I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
You're not Baxter?
My name is Emmett.
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
Jefferson City?
Where's Turley?
Going to Turley, was it?
What's Turley like?
It's a town...
They got a saloon there?
I expect.
Women?
Doesn't look quite fair.
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
I understand.
No hard feelings.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
You haven't got any money.
I'll see you around.
You might make a farmer yet.
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
The other guy drew first.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
We didn't get that far.
What now?
Where's your brother?
This a friend of yours?
He is now.
Get out of here, Jake.
All I did was kiss the girl.
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
New record.
What are you talking about?
I'm done talking. Get out.
You can't do this.
What's all this then?
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
Now let's talk about you chaps.
The jury saw it differently.
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
It's none of your business.
Rae, all we got is each other.
Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
Rae, I need help.
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
What makes you think I could?
Why would they stop you?
Why are they doing this, Mal?
Yeah, it's working out real good.
What about his brother?
I heard that too.
Hello, Cobb.
It's been a while.
You've got a legitimate job.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
You got a place to stay?
What brings you into my saloon?
Nothing like that will happen between us.
I took out thirteen dollars.
It is that.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
What is it you want from me?
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
I'm going to have to look into this.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
Stella.
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
And I know what I'm talking about.
You like a good saloon?
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
Who's the owner?
What's this?
That's the good stuff.
You really are a gambler.
Where's the dog now?
What is it that I can't figure?
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
How about you?
I wouldn't worry about that.
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
I'm glad we talked.
So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
Where is she?
Good to see you too, Elaine.
Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
Almost right.
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.
There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... "instrument".
She'll drive herself.
Hair and make-up?
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
What about it?
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Even the fall from the plane?
Even the fall from the plane.
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
Everyone you know is lying.
-- You can't go in there!
So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.
Viktor, you should have said something.
She doesn't want pity.
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
My two favorite girls.
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
As a matter-of-fact I am.
When is she coming over?
About now.  Would you like a drink?
Is Simone back to earth yet?
Impossible.
I just read somewhere --
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?
Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you.
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
Hello?
Where are you?
Thank Simone for the tickets.
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.
So you did meet her?
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a liability.
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
Of course.
You look so, so...
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
What?... What did you say?
Do what you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Yes, call me Simone.
You're with me to be close to her?
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
You can't.
Why not?
There's... a wall between you --
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
Is she here?
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
I'm sorry.
You have to see her.
I've seen them all before.
Not like this --
Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
-- We call them "vactors".
I need flesh and --
You do?
"Straw God" changed my life.
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a minute?  What brings you here tonight?
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
Hi, Dad.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
Hi, Dad.
She still with Kent?
You know, I... don't know.
Is she here tonight?
Can't you stop that?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
I do.
How?
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
Okay, Dad.
If anyone asks about Simone --
-- I know, I don't know anything.
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
One thing bothered me.
Good-night, Daddy.
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
I do okay.  How about you?
Really?  Too bad.
Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
I love you, Lainey.
Why didn't she thank you?
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
About you and mom?
Do I know you?
Nice boat, Taransky.
It's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
You love her, don't you, Max?
Don't you?
Is it a jamming device?
Why?
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Dark?
Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
My God, you've got one?
Mr. Sayer...
It's a hotel.
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
Taller, Viktor.
Would you like me to read?
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
Good.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
Simone, are you there?
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
A star is...
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
The only real truth is in the work.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
Wow. They called you their son.
--My God.
Why did you leave me?
Goodnight, Malcolm.
Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.
All your soldiers speak Latin?
I forgot your name.
Dr. Crowe.
You use needles?
No.
I'm going to see you again, right?
Where should I look then, Cole?
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
Know what?
You said the "s" word.
What about Mrs. Marschal?
...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
What'd you write?
Words.
What kind of words?
That isn't magic.
I didn't know you were funny.
Dr. Crowe.
What makes you think that?
Cats?
Can I ask you then?
What do you want more than anything?
I don't know.
I told you what I want.
I have to.
When?
Dr. Crowe?
Yes.
Something happened, didn't it?
Yes, it did.
No, we're not.
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
I wish I were somewhere else.
Don't go home, okay?
Really?
And you know what else?
What?
They're right here.
What are you thinking, Momma?
Lots of things.
You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
I'd give anything to have been there.
Yeah.
Someone got hurt.
They did?
A lady. She died.
You can see her?
Where is she?
They scare me too sometimes.
They?
You see ghosts, Cole?
They want me to do things for them.
What are you thinking, Momma?
...I don't know.
She wanted me to tell you--
Yes, Cole?
I don't know how else to look--
How did you--?
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
S-ssstop that!
S-ssssstop it!
Stuttering--
...He doesn't get invited places.
Chuck E. who?
Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.
Maybe you don't want to remember.
What are you talking about?
Chicken blood on the crops.
Oh yeah? Why's that?
Could take a little while, though.
What's a "little while?"
Nope.
Get off his case sweetie.
Fuck you.
Bitch.
Slut.
Witch.
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
Bitch.
I happen to be a professional.
Hi.
...Hi.
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
Aha. The Lovers.
Looks like the alternator.
Dammit, Carl!!!!
Carl, what are you doing?
Sounds familiar.
I could. You sucked.
Hey. Fuck you.
Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
Nike specials. Two hundred bucks.
"Peggy-Sue" --
Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!
Curt Cobain.
Well, there goes our record deal.
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.
So... what does it do?
Should we be doing this, dude?
"Old Macdonald... had --"
"With a hack-hack here --"
He means moon shining.
How... was she "called?"
This is his room... isn't it?
You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
Sure. What do you want to know.
-- It's not me!
It's time to make amends.
Throw me one.
-- And keep your eyes on the road.
Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
Down boy.
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here I come!
What the fuck you talking about, man?
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
Chicken sandwich?
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
About what?
Name something.
Then why go back now?
What about Jeremiah?
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
You wouldn't understand.
What are --
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
Suzie... No.
No Mac, please... I --
Mac... let's get out of here.
Get out of here.
...no... Mac... p-please...
What is it?!!
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
Like what?
Like your guitar break.
-- Where have you two been?
Carl.
Someone better tell Mac.
Shit.
Bill, we need to talk!
That's not funny.
Sorry.
What you up to?
Grant, where'd you go?
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
That wasn't a good night, no.
You took Bill.
It's my nature.
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
He's a fucking Martian?!
What the hell are we going to do?!
Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
Are you nodding?
I got to leave my post.
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
Who's the lucky fella?
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
Where's the old half--Mexican?
Sure thing, killer.
Flip.
I never danced in a towel before.
My present?
You're my princess, aren't you?
What are you doing?
I'll get if for you.
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
Grant, no!
I loved you. I loved --
Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
When one sees you they all see you.
Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
Get your hands off my daughter!
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
Last year, this was a new rig.
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
You got my barley pop?
Why're you driving so fast?
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
But you could get killed, right?
An existentialist.
A what?
So tell me about yourself.
Having fun.
Is this fun?
Driving?
Driving, talking to me...
They're both a challenge.
You have a great profile.
Seriously?!?
Guess what?
I give up.
Can I ask you something?
You know, you're not a bad driver.
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
Well?
Hey...
See ya, Kate.
What the hell are you doing?!?
By stealing my car?
Mississippi's the other way!
Let's hit it.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
An unmarked police car.
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
I'm proud of you.
Kate...
-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
What kind of a guy is he?
Why are you stopping?
Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
Well, thanks for the lift.
He's just exhausted.
What are you thinking?
See ya, Bandit.
Yes.
But you'll do it?
What's your pleasure?
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
Order up!
Cledus.
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
No.
Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
How long's this gonna take?
Also boring.
What are you doin' now?
Bandit?
Yeah?
Why are we doing this?
Liquid gold.
Hit the brakes!
Let's get the hell outta here.
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
We still on schedule?
I hate to say I told you so.
Save it. We got a long haul.
Bandit I, do you copy?
You can't swear on these.
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
Bandit?
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
Do I have a choice?
What's your twenty?
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
I'm at marker eight-five.
I ran into complications.
I hate to say it...
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
We're gone.
Never mind. It's nothing.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
Now what?
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
Just fine. What's the weather like?
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
Bandit II?
You're coming up to the scale house.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
Breaker. Breaker.
Go head on, breaker.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Breaker. Breaker.
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
Have any trouble getting here?
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
This is Bandit I. Over.
Shut up, Fred.
I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
Yes, ma'am.
Bandit two, you read me?
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
Now, you just find him, son.
Five thou.
That crazy sumbitch made it.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
Is your security team armed?
Of course. Yes.
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
How bad?
No.
Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
Did he give you his name?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
You shot me and murdered my friends.
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
Mmm-hmm.
But there were more of you?
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
...I forgive you Darwin.
Are you on a land line?
I've got concerns.
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
I'm here, where's the car?
D'you talk to'm?
What'd you say?
I said I got his machine.
Do you want me to say I did it?
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
...I'm sorry...
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
I am. Yeah.
Without peer?
Fifty grand gouge. South shore hayseeds, this is why I never play Tahoe, or redneck Reno...
FUCK YOU!
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
Where's Israel?
What are you doing here?
My debrief --
-- will be handled back in --
I can't discuss --
-- You can and you will.
...Does he know?
...So you made another deal?
You're trying to save Sparazza?
No... We're trying to save Heller.
...So you knew all this and yet y--
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Yeah... Sid?
You got clicks, anything?
Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
That's the punchline, y'ready?
Shoot.
A million flat.
No shit.
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Yeah... Sid?
Right, you got clicks, anything?
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
I'm working on it.
-- never in a million girl --
True?
Like a mafucka.
What were you doin' here anyway?
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
What!?
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
What's wrong?
Gibarian.
You're not Gibarian...
No?  Who am I, then?
What happened to Gibarian?
Didn't you talk to Snow?
Where's his body?
In the lab.  With her, probably.
No.  There's no behavior modification.
Yes.
You killed her!
She'll come back.
You fucking bastard...
What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
He's dead.
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
He'll let me in.
Why, who did you see?
My wife.
Probably.
I wish you'd told me.
Kelvin, you awake?
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
Perhaps it did.
They come when you sleep.
What happened?
What plan?
Her oxygen would have run out.
Oh, God.  I'm awake.
I need to see Snow.
I'll go with you.
Don't.
I don't know.  I can't be alone.
What are they?
To calm your anxiety.
We're taking a flight?
Not a very happy poem.
You didn't look very happy.
I wasn't.
And tonight?
You want to fuck her?
Let's go home.
I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
What do you remember?
Is it intelligent?
Then it's God, right?
It's something.
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
What happened to us, exactly?
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
Yes.  Yes.
What's wrong.
Sartorius.
But we fought.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
You... she said I didn't love her.
Was she right?
No.  I love you.
You don't want me.
But that's what happened before.
Do you?
What's wrong?
Gibarian.  He was here.
You said he was dead.
What's happening to us?
How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
Rheya --
I'm disgusting.
No.
You should have told me.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
Neither did I.
You never said you wanted one.
Chris --
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
I want you here.
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
Is that really what you want?
I want to stop taking those pills.
What are you taking?
What does it want?
Where did you go before?
He won't do it.
Why do you say that?
Followed by non-human manifestations.
Snow, get up here, now.
Claire!
They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
You didn't like him?
It's terrific Win.
I've never seen anyone killed before.
Right.  That's true.
Can we go then?
I'm supposed to call in.
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
You live in Manhattan?
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
Are you nervous?
Put it on my account, please.
You can touch me, I won't bite.
Hey!  There are crazy people here.
Let's get a drink.
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Sooner, the better.
He said he'd kill me.
Claire?
Urdu and Hindi.
Didn't do very well, did you?
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
So, this could be your last night, huh?
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
So it was "love".
No dog.
But "nice".
What about Neil?
What's to like?
Tell it like it is.
You could do better.
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
Good night, Mike.
Claire?
What do you want?
Open the door, will you?
Stop, will you?!
Let go!
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
They called here after you left...
I don't know you...
Not exactly.
What do you want to do?
Oh God, that's great!
Oh that thing in Queens.
Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
What a memory.
It wouldn't work.
I'd miss my life...
How long you going away for?
"For"...?
Claire!
Everyone's all right...?
So.
You still going away?
I don't know...
You don't have to, now.
I'll miss you, Mike.
I like your coat.
Say goodbye, Mike.
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
You're planning to speak?
Not if you don't want me to.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
... just saying you should think twice about it...
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
Keep what handy?
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
Tommy...!
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
Mike?
What?
My ass if falling.
Your what...?
My ass is falling.  It is.
You got no idea...
I can still use a gun.
I think television's a dangerous thing.
Hey.  The neighbors.
Oh, some shit.
What shit, honey?
She's got to identify him.
I think -- she's crazy.
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
Bought it.
It's not your taste.
She took you shopping for a tie?
I had to follow her to a store.
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
Ellie, it was a formal party...
Coming to bed?
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
Did you hear what I said?
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
What was that?
I'm sorry.
What did you do tonight?
I watched TV.
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.
Ellie...
Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as good a job.
But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
Koontz!  I need you guys!
Not Koontz.
Wasn't your fault.
Tell me I'm dreamin'.
Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman.
Ever shot anyone?
Yes.
Are you in charge here?
I asked for the man in charge...
You're here 'til what time?
You should'a brought the girl.
Hold it...!
Why should she come in?
Let my kid go.
Watch your step!
What're we having?
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
How do you know where the gun is?
God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!
Nice threads Dad.
How are things going, pal?
Okay, I guess.
How about dinner tonight?
Mom and I got plans.
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
She's taking singing lessons.
Shooting.
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
I don't think she can sing, either.
Well, look who's dressing for success.
And Flash isn't?
Peter-- you took this picture?
What, want a glass?
So, uh... how's college goin'?
Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
Remember Little League?
I know.
I was there.
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
Flash, get lost.
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
What's in there?
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
Jesus Christ.
You get mugged or something?
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Now tell me you love me.
Lemme down, bugface!
Are you okay?
Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Can't focus...
Would you cool it already?
Frmpph-yrr.
What's this? A cockaroach?
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
How about tomorrow?
You're making my life difficult.
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
An even five I throw in the jacket.
Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
He knew.
What if you get hurt?
Good morning, Liz.
How very dull, Peter Parker.
I-- uh--
Uh is a good start.
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
I hate the Platonic idea of you.
I hate people with alliterative names.
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
God, Flash can be such a jerk.
But you like that in a man?
What are you doing this weekend?
I've gotta study.
Sit down and stop being such a child.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
Do you mind if I come too?
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
Peter?
You sure about all this?
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
Yeah, Roz.
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
It's Friday night...
The record--
What the hell is that?
Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
A match made in heaven.
Peter, you're bleeding.
It's fine.  Tell me what--
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
Mr. Parker.
Peter, what can I do for you?
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
Your dog ate it.
Actually, I got this spider bite
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -
Luck.  The right place at the right time.
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
Why? It is a wrestling match, or
Where'd you get the clown suit?
Like it?
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?
Bonkers.
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
Up here, Docky Ocky!
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
What's wrong with him?
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
Jawohl.
Jawohl.
Is you all little Adolfs?
We made a deal with Barrack One.
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
Come on!
Roger.
Coming up.
There's only one pair left.
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
And maybe a little something else?
Have a cigar.
Put me down for ten, you louse.
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
How much more do we have to take from him?
Then we're all in on it?
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
What some brandy?
You won't get off that cheap.
Let's blow, Chauncey.
I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
What is your number?
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
It is.
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Interesting.
Say, Schulz --
Jawohl?
What is this? This is water?
It's a mouse trap.
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
I'll kill you, Harry -- so help me!
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
You can say that again!
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
Let me go! Let me go!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
You want Betty Grable!
Let me go!
What's the award?
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Me? What if she don't want me?
You're teasing me again!
No, Animal.
Easy, Animal! Easy!
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal?
Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
So what? There's other women!
You'll fix me up!
To the Brick Kremlin!
She'll never forgive me!
What do those broads say?
What do they always say?
That's what I wanna hear.
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
Grable, not Gable!
Do Grable.
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
I'll open mine now.
Let me alone.
You're crying, Animal.
Let me do it, Hoffy.
You want to go?
Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.
Yes, sir.
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --
It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is, he's sure batting a thousand.
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
What about Schulz?
We've all done a poor job of it.
Stay out of it, Sefton.
Says who?
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
What's the matter, boys? Is my slip showing?
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
You starting that again?
How do they know?
You told them, Hoffy.
You did!
You could use a new one yourself.
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
Nothing for Kuzawa?
Shapiro. Shapiro.
When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
Ach so!
No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
What time?
Schulz, you're off your nut!
Give me the radio.
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
Ich weiss alles.
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
Who's the guy, Schulz?
I do not want those cigarettes.
I'll make it five hundred!
Talk what? I do not know anything!
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
This is me in Cincinnati.
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
From a chicken, bug-wit.
Is it all right if we smell it?
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.
Have a nice time over there?
So you're stuck with me, eh?
Toh-pak-cha=8A 
The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
It's working.
Target their Bridge.
This is its current position.
Population?
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
I get it. I get it.
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
We're within range, sir.
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
Soran?
All of us.
Where is he now?
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
Can I?
Yes, where would you go?
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
No, no. Thank you.
We don't have a tractor beam.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
That's right.
Close to retirement?
I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death.  Scotty?
A photon torpedo?
Keep her together until I get back.
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
Is there a problem?
No, sir.
Understood. That will be all.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
That's a pretty big margin of error.
Captain, are you all right?
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
You must think I'm quite the madman.
We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
Transwarp at your command, Sir!
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
Put me on the hailing frequency.
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
You did great, Bones... Just great.
Response?
What did you see, Chekov?
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
Aye sir, coding now.
Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
I don't believe it...
Hello, sir. It's David.
David!... What went wrong?
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
Underground deposit?
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
I'll handle that later.
.          .. Spock's tube...
What is it?
Later. Let's go...
Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
That may be difficult...
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
Not exactly.
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
This planet is aging in surges.
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
Sir...?
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
How many more?
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
The Genesis planet is gone.
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
My God...
I know you... Do I not?
You would have done the same for me.
Yes, yes, Spock...
On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.
... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
Count on our help, sir.
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?
I think it's an energy form, sir...
... A cloaking device?
About a dozen officers and men.
What about surface life signs...?
Close... There --
We are clear and free to navigate.
The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
No, sir, no response.
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
Gentlemen. Good evening.
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Welcome aboard, Admiral.
Where's Doctor McCoy?
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.

There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
No.
But, why?
Genesis, I want it.
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
... He spoke of your friendship.
... The needs of the many outweigh...
... The needs of the few...
... Or the one.
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
What I have done, I had to do.
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
Share this with no one.
Success, my lord.
I ordered no interruptions.
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
Range: 3000 Kellicams.
Firing range, sir.
1,000 Kellicams, closing!
500 Kellicams!
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
You amaze me, Commander.
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
You're not going in there -- !
Physician, heal thyself.
That's all you have to say?
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
Say thank you.
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
And who am I hiding from?
Shore leave, Admiral.
What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Now that's what I call a meal.
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?
... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --
The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
Jim... read me? Can you read me?
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
... Can't read you... repeat...
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
... taking Genesis away from us...
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy.
David --
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
Are you sure these are the coordinates?
You're crazy -- !
I saw it -- !
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
But the child --
He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?
Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
Where's Dr. Marcus --
Why didn't you tell me?
It's a long story.
It's the Genesis Wave!
How soon --
We encoded four minutes --
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
I don't mean to intrude.
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
Let go -- he can't -- !
What are you looking at?
The Admiral's son.
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
Let them eat static.
Sir -- our shields are dropping!
They won't --
Departing dark side, Regula.
Yours... is... the superior...
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
Aye, sir.
We'll be going to warp speed --
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
Just barely, sir.
I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.
Uhura. Can't you augment?
She's not responding...
Try the emergency channels...
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Mr. Scott on discrete.
On screen.
... No response, sir.
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Give the word, Admiral.
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
Meaning you can't even beam us back?
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
And who is this?
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
Is the word given?
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
Carol Marcus --
The power of creation --
What's she doing here?
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
They knew just where to hit us.
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Not enough against their shields.
The prefix code?
Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's  inside the station.
... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
What IS working around here?
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
Spock!
The ship -- out of danger?
... the good of the few...
In my quarters, Uhura.
Permission to speak candidly, sir?
And why not?
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
You earned it.
I did not think so.
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
Yes.
This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.
Khan!
Reliant's command...
Indeterminate life signs.
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
Hold your course. Look sharp...
Mr. Saavik, all stop.
Cease fire. Look sharp.
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
Time from my mark...
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Time!
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
Understood, sir.
Admiral on the bridge!
Stop engines.
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
I can't get power, sir!
Admiral on the bridge --
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
He's not what I expected, Sir.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
All moorings are clear, Captain.
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
Certainly...
You lied.
I do not understand the final question...
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
Where must you go?
To Earth. To offer testimony.
Humans make illogical decisions...
Heard there was some excitement.
How're you doing?
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
No!  No... What did you have in mind...?
You sure this is such a bright idea?
It'll come back to him.
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
-- That's the general idea.
An experimental device, doctor.
Wake up, man, wake up!
Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.
Hi... Busy?
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
That is what I said, Doctor.
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
... Best shot...?
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
You're saying... It is a compliment.
We're just -- observing.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please...
The top of what?
Name?
No, <u>my</u> name.
I do not know your name.
You play games with me and you're through
Go ahead. Stun me.
Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
Shields, Mr. Chekov.
No choice now, Scotty!
Ah, well done, team 2.
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.
Can you protect us?
I suppose they told you that...?
So you were at Berkeley.
You sure you won't change your mind?
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
We don't want to be any trouble.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
They're gonna hafta take their chances.
Do you trust me?
Just lucky, I guess.
You're upset about losing the whales.
... You're very perceptive.
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
Where could you take them?
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
What's that?
Wanna try it from the top?
... Who are you?
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
All right. The truth?
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
Here... In the park?
Steady, now. We need your help.
Kirk. They're gone.
If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
Oh my God, we're too late!
Permission to come aboard.
Permission granted.
Thank you, Admiral.
Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
Mr. Spock, your computations?
In progress, Admiral.
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
What is our target in time?
You've programmed that from memory...?
How do you know this...?
Spock...
I cannot tell a lie.
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
The tank will be finished by morning...
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
Admiral. Full power is restored.
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
They did, Admiral.
Spock: Condition report!
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
Warp two... three...
Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
... Aye sir...?
Ready sir.
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Three-one-zero, aye!
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
I have no control, sir!
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
What is it?
Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
Uhura!... Where!
Bearing!
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
Estimate range, ship to whales!
I can't, sir -- Nothing!
Scotty, how long is this bay?
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.
Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
Full power, sir.
Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
The whales...?!
No power to the bay doors.
It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
I am well, Admiral.
We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
Professor Scott, if you'll --
Well, that's different.
I notice you're still working with polymers.
Hello? Computer...?
Just use the keyboard...
Hi.
Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
But not you.
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
... an offlander?
Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...
Mother and son. You arranged this...?
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
I understand.
Don't you ever get tired?
Really?
Chase me!
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
Androids... don't have...fun.
No... I want to stay with you...
Can he breathe under water?
Data doesn't breathe.
Won't he rust?
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
Will he live?
She's stabilizing.
Is it safe to move her?
Hello, Data...
Captain, Geordi...?
Yes... that looks like them.
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
I'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation, Captain...
Will the structure hold if we blast through?
Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
I'll order Riker to turn around.
It is not over.
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
Understood.
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
May I talk to you alone?
They... are in opposite directions, sir...
We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.
The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
I don't believe it happened that way.
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
Implants bothering you?
A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
Will that stop the tear?
You got me, Commander.
I don't think they believe us.
The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
Commander, I'm showing two Son'a ships on an intercept course.
I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...
We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
They're powering their forward weapons array.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
Who is it?
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
You must be planning on doing some hunting.
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
Would you like something to eat?
Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.
I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way...
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
One. It's Ru'afo.
... Population three hundred million...
What are they interested in...?
Wine, women and song.
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
What you're doing to my neck...
But it's comfortable.
Why don't you try sitting up?
Or you could try lying down.
... I believe you...
Augh.
Initiate launch sequence.
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
Absolutely.
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
There must be some good people... even in this time.
He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
Not yet.
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
How long has he been unconscious?
Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
I do not know what you are referring to.
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
Isn't it better like this...?
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
Can you configure it?
I believe so.
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
I have helm control.
What year is it?
Who are you?
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
I told you, there's no --
What did you do to the batteries?
This must be it.
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.
No... the door's too thick.
Altitude fifty kilometers...
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
ATR setting...
Active.
Main bus...
Ready.
Jean-Luc Picard.
Great name. French?
Yes.
Where are you from most recently?
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
You seem to have an answer for everything.
Something wrong with that?
What do you want?
The invasion plans.
There is no invasion...
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
"Money." So you can get dome money...
What?
You're lying.
Were the two of you... involved?
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
Friends from Cornell...
Some.
You're leaving, aren't you?
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
That's impossible.
Incoming transmission from the Borg.
Life signs?
Track their weapons fire.
Port battery, ready sir!
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
Target locked!
Report.
We're still in Earth orbit.
Looks like they damaged the silo...
Return to our own time?
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
Unless you'd like to stay.
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
What are they doing?
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
Agreed. Options?
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
Are you alright?
Report!
We've lost Bridge control!
Emergency override!
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
They're bypassing Engineering...
Worf to Bridge.
Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
Worf? Is something wrong?
What the hell happened down there, Worf?
Mr. President.
I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
I believe the operation is over.
You may need assistance, doctor...
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
Spock, that was actually funny.
Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
Or not to be -
What the Hell's going on?
Thanks...
We're not finished.
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
What is it with you, anyway?
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
If they're even looking for us...
Damned clever if you ask me...
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
This is fun...
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
We were until your torpedoes!
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
Stand...?
I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
They'll make it look like an accident...
They'll respect him now...
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
Would you care to go topside?
My God, what happened here?
You feign ignorance?
He's a DOCTOR!
He just tried to save him!
I checked the data banks, yes.
And what did they tell you?
Are those your words?
Yes.
Spoken by you?
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
Yes.
For insubordination.
Where is Mr. Sulu?
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
Just the size of my head -
Torpedo room--?
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
From Starfleet?
She's here - somewhere.
Shields. Battle stations.
They're preparing to fire.
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet?
Aye, sir.
An INCIDENT?
Do we report this, sir?
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
I've heard of chameloids - "Shapeshifters" - I thought you were mythical.
Your friends are late...
Isn't it about time you became something else?
What took you so long?
Kill him! He's the one!!
He's got it.
How did you know...?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
How much time's left of your sentence?
Except us.
I know how to get outside the shield.
Stand down your weapons.
This is incredible -
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
Kronos, sir?
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
I always wanted to try that.
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
I hope you're happy.
Sir?
Just the prototype.
Sulu!
You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
When does this conference start?
According to my information, today.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
They're dying.
Never been this close.
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
What is it?
I am uncertain.
What the -
The peace conference.
I was blind. I couldn't see past the death of my son. I couldn't trust.
But I am not human. I am only -
Close enough to beam down?
Control tower, reading, Sir.
Captain --
Gorkon's own man??
Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...
You must have faith.
Her own father...?
Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
A lie?
If you are logical.
Direct hit -
Trouble?
Sir?
You having hearing problems, mister?
According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
What is it?
Praxis?
At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -
It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
A computer canna lie, sir.
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
That could take hours!
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time.
Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...
I don't think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.
Fuzzy face is gone.
Do you know who I am?
Can you remember our father?
No.
Why?
Because you are dangerous.
I do not understand.
For how long?
Indefinitely.
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
Beverly, come in.
Not tonight, I have work here.
So... To happy endings.
Now, you make a toast.
To new worlds...
He is very observant.
Data!
A bit less florid, Data.
A weapon.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
Do you think this is a wise course of action?
Ready, Captain.
Of you?
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
We are losing dorsal shields.
We are being hailed.
Negative.
You have a red shirt.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
It appears to be...  ... an arm.
It's you.
May I have this dance?
Do you have a moment, sir?
I'm going to miss you.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
How can you be certain?
Imzadi. This is so good.

What do we know about the planet?
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
Sir?
Deanna, on my mark.
How long until he can fire?
I'll take care of it, sir.
New Praetor?
Understood.

Not with the Romulans.
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
So, human... you've met your better self!
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
I won't do it.
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
To find the head, sir?
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
No!
Captain!
We're being hailed.
Sir, we're being hailed.
Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.
What's this?
It's working.
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
Not very chatty.
He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.
Strength in numbers?
Praetor Shinzon. Were not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
And the Senate supports you?
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
It's not quite the face you remember.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
You don't trust me.
Looking up at the stars.
After you, Praetor.
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
With a full head of hair.
In time, Jean Luc.
Why am I here?
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
Long ago.
I don't know.
That's your life... not mine.
Please.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
What about Picard?
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
So theyve got him up and running.
He's a very unusual android.
My God...
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Intruder alert!
Are we prepared?
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
The bond is broken.
Find her again.
No -- this is wasting time.
It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.
How long?
What?!
Praetor...
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
They're holding position.
And?
But surely...
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
I have a purpose.
Benny, God, take it easy...
Don't you think you should call a backup?
Gate three. It's boarding now.
Thank you.
What can I do for you folks?
Sure.
I'll have to run your card off now.
We're only going to be here a few hours...
I understand.
I make maps.
Eh... yes.
Do you have children?
What do you think of America?
No!!! No!!!
Where did you stop last?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Where did you stop last?
Stay right there...
What was your last stop?
Elmo's...
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
It's real, George.
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.
Contain it and get back to me.
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
When can we expect containment?
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
It's taken on a disguise.
The extraterrestrial now looks like this.
We don't know what else to do. We need results.
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
Shermin...
What's all this for?
That's the chance we have to take.
Then you're going to have to do it without me.
What?
Mrs. Haydn...
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
Please...
What?
Ah... no...
Steering wheel.
Steering wheel.
Gear shift.
Dashboard.
What?!
Eh... police.
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
Good.
Which way?
What?
What?
Pancakes.
What?
Money.
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
Smile.
Smile... good?
What?!
Minneapolis.
Minneapolis... good.
No gas.
No gas.
Gas good?
Closed?
I am Jenny Haydn.
Gas.
No gas.
Who?
Shit.
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
Shit... shit... what shit?
In your pocket, please...
You. Mouth closed.
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
Money.
What is...  ...Coke?
A drink.
I...
You want to try it?
I want to try it.
What?
It was yellow.
I will see it next time.
Why are you going here? What is here?
I do not understand.
Sun...
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
Is that a baby?
A baby is a new person?
Eh... yes...
Do you have a baby?
But I must go here.
The driver will...
You want this ticket?
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Can I have the gun?
Jennyhaydn.
Goodbye.
What?
What happened?
No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
Yes?
What is hell?
It's bad.
What are you doing?
Are you my friend?
Yes.
Nobody knows.
Why?
I like this music.
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
I do not want to.
I am not a good singer.
That was beautiful.
You liked my singing?
Are you angry at me?
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
Where are you going?
I must meet my ship.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
I feel better if I move.
Asshole!!
Where did you learn that?
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
I can't stay on this planet.
No one's traveling in this weather.
You promised you would get me to my ship.
What are you saying?
You can stop. I will go on alone.
You are cold.
You're damn right I am.
What?
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
What for?
I want to get money for you and the baby.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
The cook again?
What will you say about us?
Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
How long will it take you to get home?
There.
Well...
What do I do now?
Tell the baby about me.
I will.
Help me!!
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
Call the police!!
You sure this is your car?
My grandmother's rich.
Slow down, slow down.
I told you I'm looking for someone.
They after you?
Is it for real?
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
Tell him I'm not here.
They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
This has always been my favorite time of day.
No, sir. Radar.
Twenty-eight years.
To the same woman?
How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
It was a man though... right?
Where are you going?
I don't understand.
I told you...
Is there a reward in this?
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
No problem.
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
I made my choice, Lenny.
Fuck you.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
You can't just... kill him.
I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
Cut it out, Tran.
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
Faith, call me, okay?
You talked to Iris?  When?
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
He has his uses too.
We should talk alone.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
I understand.  No, I'm not.
What?  Right Here?
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
Yeah.  No, not really.
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
He records himself raping and killing her--
But this is a bad one.
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
He's been cooked-off
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
You just did.
No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Who was just here?
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
Nero.
Strickland.
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
Your sex life?
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
Yeah, but that was for love.
What's his name?
What the fuck are you doing?
Are we having a bad night?
Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
So am I.  Just trying to get by.
No, you're just trying to get off.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
Forget her.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
What's that?  Present from Faith?
My God, Lenny.  What is it?
Black.  Jack.
And gives it to you.
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
Is this great fabric or what?
No more, Lenny.
But that doesn't add, does it.
No it doesn't.
That's where it gets a little strange.
Whatup Lenny?
You better keep a low profile for a while.
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Those two guys were cops.
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
Well, look at the plus side.
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
He's totally cut off from the outer world.
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
You see Tran?
Alright.  We're going up.
That's the original.  There are no copies.
Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
See you downtown.
Right.  That explains it.
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
Was this him?
Um... he was older.
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
No, sir.
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
Who knows.
Agent Mackelway.
What's the bad news?
You heard?
You have the body?
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
Jesus.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
Yeah.
Whole country or just hereabouts?
My God.
Not bad, huh?
You're a... you're sick.
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
I've been looking for you.
How did you know he was a construction worker?
You have the photo from the diner?
He said it was a clue?
Maybe cause he's smart.
What?
We have another one.
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
What are you doing?
Who?
Speck. Harold Speck.
From the grave?
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
How do you feel, Agent
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
I'll take it into consideration.
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
I don't believe this.
We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
Why did you go to Chicago?
I was visiting an old college friend.
I was looking for a pattern.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
I didn't use Low's name.
There was talk of a file photo.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
How long have you been downtown?
You work with Koessler?
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
That information's being withheld from the media.
Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
Yes I do.
Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
The other reason?
And one other thing.
What's that?
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
Because you asked him to, stupid.
There are Agency regulations about this.
It's a no-no.
I know.
Does Koessler ask about me?
He's called a couple times.
What did you tell him?
Just routine stuff.
Not about coming to see Daitz?
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
The tattoo?
Sue Ann Hanson.
Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
That's true.
Then there's the other issue.
And nobody else can do that?
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
Hello?
Jaime? Where are you?
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
Start killing people for real?
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
You were right. He found me.
You okay?
Yeah, of course.
Low calls him Suspect Zero.
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
What happened?
Agent...
Unlock these cuffs.
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
How did you know Speck was a killer?
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
I don't carry it with me.
You? You went by the book?
Is he dead?
[Reality very risky.]
[Lionheart, what happened?]
Lead the way, Murman.
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
I want to help you.
[What does the file say?]
I want to go live with you.
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
So you're the new meat?
What did you do to end up here?
I believe it's in my file, sir.
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Koessler?
Speck is dead.
Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.
I don't think you understand.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
It's over for you.
You have to put things in perspective.
You've been through worse.
You're right. I know.
Ever since I've known you.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
Are you calling Her?
You should call your Grandmother.
Don't do it, Mike.
How are you ladies doing this evening?
What do you drive?
What kind of car do you drive?
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
You're a comedian?
Yeah.
I'd say about two weeks.
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
Well, thank you...?
Nikki.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Mike.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Like the quiche?
Yes. Like the quiche.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
Just like that?
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
How was it hard?
Tell me about it...
You too?
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
It does.
Like what?
Anything?
Charles! What's up, man?
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
...not until you book it...
...and even then...
They're out of Glenlivet.
Hi.
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
You haven't told then, huh?
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
Let me just check on my boy.
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
Oh my God.
The poor thing. Six years?
...And she's with someone else.
A couple of high rollers like you?
Could you believe it?
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
What do you guys do?
You have to lay it on the table.
You want this in black chips.
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
Well, who represents you back east?
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
Why not?
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
Sorry, it's just that...
You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
Well... This is it.
Listen. I had a great time.
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
You're a comedian?
Yeah. And an actor.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
Well, I should be getting...
...It's really getting late.
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
...The red piece of shit over there...
Hello?
Hi, Mike?
Are you on the other line?
Yeah, hold on.
I can call back...
...Six months.
How are you doing?
Fine... I guess. You?
Good.  I think about things.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What kind of things?
You know, us.
I thought you met someone else.
Really?
I miss you, Mike.
Right.
Right.
Well that sucks.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
There's the rub.
I don't think I'm gonna take it.
It's a gig.
I mean, I need the money.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today?
Oh no?
I didn't mention her once today.
You want to hit the town tonight?
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
I'll give you an eight. 
What'd you get?
Sounds more like Aids...
Kinda money, huh?
I'll get a Dewars rocks... 
Ah, there's the rub...
I just tested for one...
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
What's that guy's name? Sue?
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
I got to at least try once.
You haven't been drinking, have you?
You want to talk about it?
Uuuuugh!
Oh boy.
I'm such an asshole.
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
Well, that's dumb.
What's dumb about it?
You little bitch!
You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.
It's kinda money, actually.
Make someone bleed.
What's he do?
Who threw this party, anyway?
How's it going for you two?
Not well.
Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.
Good for you, man. He's being smart.
Don't call me ever again.
Are you ready to order?
Hello?
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
VEGAS.
What Vegas?
We're going to Vegas.
When?
Tonight, baby.
I can't lose more than a hundred.
Wait.
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Vegas, baby!
Vegas.
Wake up, baby.
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
They're all skanks.
Cut that shit out.
She smiled baby.
That's not cool.
Did she, or did she not smile?
It doesn't matter...
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
You think they're watching?
Double down.
I know, but...
Yeah? Well obviously not always!
...Well, you know, not counting the first table.
Thanks for clarifying that.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
Let's just leave.
Let's go.
Mikey's the big winner.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
That was so demeaning...
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
Did she, or did she not smile.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
I know she's coming back.
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
Oh... a Dorothy.
No!
No! Not the camera guy!
What?
I gotta use the phone.
No, baby. You're money.
She didn't like me, anyway.
She thought you were money.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
Michelle went for you, right.
That was different.
He drives a carriage.
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
This version doesn't have fighting?
No.
You guys are such assholes.
What time's this party tonight?
Who? Rob?
Yeah. You met him once.
...the Copa, in New York...
How you guys doing?
It's on.
Which one?
What are you doing?
She didn't see.
We got the digits, baby.
Please, don't mess with me right now...
A day.
It's not like that...
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
Bitch... You little bitch!
Because he's a bitch.
...against the computer.
They're a finesse team...
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
What a surprise...
No.
No.
Yes she did.
That was pretty cold, dude.
It's on.
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
...honestly...
...you're money...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
...Tomorrow, then a day.
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
It's on...
It is on.
The bear's got his claws back.
Be smart about it.
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
...Okay, two...
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
Good.  He never doubted you.
I ask for Justice.
The Court gave you justice.
An eye for an eye!
Be my friend.
What's the matter, Carlo?
You're staying home.  You're not going out.
The food is on the table.
I'm not hungry yet.
Eat it, it's on the table.
Ba Fa Goulle.
You heard about your father?
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
Outside.
You think we'll go for that last place?
Is it necessary?
He's his own boss, and very competent.
When did he call?
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
Yes.
You mean Tattaglia.
Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
What was this for?
For bravery.
And this?
For killing a man.
What miracles you do for strangers.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
And now, what do you choose to do?
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
No, I wanted other things for you.
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
Yes.
You want him to stay in this country.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
I know.
Where are you going?
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
You tell us about America.
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
I know about what you mean!
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
Mike!  The party starting!
Who are those girls?
Mike!
What about Luca?  Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca.  That worries me.
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
That's easy to say; it's not your father.
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
Jesus, I don't know...
Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
What was that?
Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
How will they come at you?
I've never seen anything like it.
Michael, what are those men doing?
They're waiting to see my father.
Who is he?
You really want to know?
Yes.  Tell me.
You like spaghetti?
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Then Luca turned to the other man...
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
I told you you wouldn't like him.
How do you do.
Michael, what are you doing?
Michael?
I'm thinking about it.
Hello.  Kay?
How is your father?
I LOVE YOU.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Can you say it?
Huh?
I can't...
Please say it.
I don't think so either.  I better go.
Don't you want dinner first?
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
Don't ask me.
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
Until the old man tells me different.
All right, Sonny.  All right.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Where are you going?
To the city.
Mikey, you look beautiful!
We're going to New Jersey?
I do renounce him.
And all his works?
Do you wish to be baptized?
Let us fill up our Regimes.
He talked to you?
You think I scam?
Yeah.
Do you recognize my voice?
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
Is that good?
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
Uncanny!
Hi Tom.
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
I'll come down.
Okay, darling.
You'd say if you mind?
No, I like him.
Marge, you like everybody.
Shut up.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
I hope it wasn't cheap.
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
Say again?
You know, a primer.
I'm intruding.
Can you mix a martini?
I'm never going back!
You like jazz!
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
Sure. I love Venice.
You're breaking my ribs!
I played piano in a few places.
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
Do you have any brothers?
I didn't mean with you in it.
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
I thought you'd missed the train.
Freddie drove me back in his car.
Is Freddie here?
I'm prepared to take the blame.
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
That's good.
I've got plans!
Ripley's plans.
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
What?
I wanted to tell you my plan.
How?
You love me and you're not marrying me.
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
What are you doing?
Marge-maintenance.
Dickie?
Who is it?
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
Tom. How are you? You look well.
I'm well, thank you.
Far cry from New York.
No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.
I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
I never said that!
Frances?
Hello Marge.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
He hates being confronted.
Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
Marge, when did you get here?
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
Dickie did it.
Hello Marge!
Look at me what?
Very.
Did Dickie's Dad go?
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
I found Dickie's rings.
What?
You've got Dickie's rings.
I don't believe you.
No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley.
Is this you?
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
What's your secret?
I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith Randall.
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
Which is?
Randall.
How did you know that?
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
I know.
Let's go.
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
What?
Just kidding. Are you alone?
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
So -- are you travelling under R?
Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
A ragione. A ragione. 
Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
Will we see you later?
I can't later.
Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one.
What did he say?
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
Not guilty.
Are you okay?
It's okay.
Tom, are you okay?
You try. You try talking to her.
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
Hello. What are you up to?
All kinds of things. Making plans.
Was that Meredith?
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
Or Tom and Peter even.
Well that would be even better gossip.
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
Peter, I... I...
You're such a liar...
Dickie Greenleaf?
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
Can we go up? Do you mind?
Of course. What happened to your face?
I really don't want to see anybody.
Even your fiancée...?
Even her.
What about Thomas Ripley?
November, I thought.
November 7th is my information.
I don't remember the exact date.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
A few days ago.
31 people.
It is a little coarse, yes.
You got a .44 Magnum?
That's an expensive gun.
You like ball games?
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
You want to canvass?
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
Well, we're all working tonight.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
Yes?
My name is Travis.
I can believe that.
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
You must be rich.
It keeps ya busy.
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
Oh. Who was that again?
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
What are you doing?
Damn.
Where are you going?
I'm leaving.
These are not the kind of movies I go to.
This is sort of high class...
I mean porno movies.
Well... mostly...
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
But... Betsy...
What about the record?
Hello, Travis.
I see where Palantine got the nomination.
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
Travis?
You forgot "sexy".
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
Just what?
Have you been noticing anything strange?
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
How long has he been there?
Try holding the match like this.
This is gotta be a game, right?
Ouch!
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
Is he Italian?
You sure he's not Italian?
With the other hand, right?
Betsy, come over here a moment.
What is it? I'm busy.
What is your name? My name is Travis.
Awh, come off it, Pal.
That's fine.
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
Yeah.
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
For a fee.
Where.
You carry a piece? You need one?
Hello.
You looking for some action?
Why you hang around with them greasers?
A girl needs protection.
What's your name?
That ain't much of a name.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
I don't like my real name.
What's your real name?
Iris.
That's a nice name.
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
I musta been stoned.
Do they drug you?
You can do it in my mouth.
Don't you want to go?
I can leave anytime I want.
Well, I tried.
Can I see you again?
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
Well, you want to or not?
Where?
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
You a narc?
God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
You just gonna leave 'em?
What should I do? Call the cops?
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
Sure you don't want to come with me?
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
Nice talking to you, Travis.
No trouble with the Hack Bureau?
No Sir.
Got your license?
I can't sleep nights.
There's porno theatres for that.
You want to work uptown nights?
How's your driving record?
Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
Physical? Criminal?
Also clean.
Age?
Twenty-six.
Education?
Some. Here and there.
You moonlightin?
No, I want long shifts.
No.
Well then check back tomorrow.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
You would, huh?
Your name Sport?
Anything you say, officer.
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
Shit.
I'm no cop.
I'm hip.
Hey, Sport. How are things?
What's going on?
I'm here to see Iris.
Travis.
What's the action around?
Wiz?
Well, I just, you know...
Things got ya down?
Yeah.
I know.
Had a close one.
Hey!  Now there's some good news.
Spit it out.
It's me sir.
He says he's leaving the island sir.
Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
I'm a field agent.
Well yes I suppose ...
You suppose?
Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder...
Limp dick?
What, vou?
What are you doing?
Mason.  Mason?
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
Hi.
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
What about you, Delly?
You'll stand by me?
Dad?
I think  it's worse  now.
You mean,  me?
Me too.
You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.
You first.
How'd they get it inside?
So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
And why not?
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
We were in love... weren't we?
What was that?
Nothing.  
Do you have the...
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
Well, there's got to be a way...
When did you start smoking?
Exactly.  And he got good.
Now, did you remember that, or...
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
Your dancing's very good.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
I... I need a drink of water.
Only one in town.  Get in, son.
Here we are.
Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
Are you saying that he's...
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
No.  But...
What's that?
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
Harry, son.  Harry.
Nine and-a-half years ago.
Wait'll you see the inside!
That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her soul.
They couldn't wait to see you.
Who... are they?
Oh.  What... what time is it?
Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here?
"February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
Ernie.
I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up.
You bet.
Beautiful, wasn't it?
Dad, I...
Ha!
Jesus...
The film broke...
I'm here.
Did you... did you...
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
Anybody take it?
A few.
Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
The G-man?
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
Here, one of mine.
What is it?
Call me... Ishmael?
... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me.
That's where you live.
Evening, Luke.
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
You kids off to the dance?
Aren't you coming?
You think he's drunk somewhere?
What's his rent?
Huh?
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
I was decorated.
I know.  A Purple Heart.
You can't testify.
The FBI can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong.
Cigarette?
When'd you quit smoking?
Not any more.
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
When was that?
That was beautiful.
I taught you that.
Sit.  Play with me.
Is there a young Tim?
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
Please, sit.
The customers?  I don't know...
Oh.
It's about me.
What happened?
What exactly did you hear?
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
I suppose.  Thanks.
You hungry, son?
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
I already have.
My girlfriend.  If she still is...
No.  Absolutely not.
Miss Hayworth?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
No. Just a few hours.
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
I was wondering...
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
Would you like some brandy?
I think so.
How do you like our little hamlet?
Where are you from originally, Annie?
I guess you knew that, anyway.
Then why did she object to you?
Because she was afraid.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
You get straight to the point, don't you?
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
Do you think I should go?
That's up to you.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Is anyone there?
Yes, I did.
Mother!
No!
They haven't harmed anyone.
Miss Daniels?
Is smoking fun?
Oh, I suppose so.
Could I have a puff?
I don't think your mother would like that.
I know.
Don't you like us?
Darling, of course I do!
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
Mitch, let's turn back.
What?
The little Brenner girl.
Lois!
It's Alice, ain't it?
No, it's Lois!
Good morning.
I wonder if you could help me.
Do you know him?
Yep.
Where does he live?
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Right across the bay there.
See where I'm pointing?
Yes?
And the white house?
That's where the Brenners live.
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
The two kids?
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
Mmmm.
Thank you.
What name?
Daniels.
Yep?
The little girl's name.
The little Brenner girl?
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
How much for the phone calls?
I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
What happened?
You cut yourself outside, Miss?
Gulls!
No. Here's fine. 
A what?
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
You did say birds?
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
Whose side are you on?
Yes, very.
And certainly pretty.
How long have you known her?
I told you. We met yesterday.
Yes.
No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
Mother?
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
I got them all, Mother.
When do you think they'll come?
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
That's a chance we have to take.
Maybe we ought to leave.
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
Mitch...
Mother, get a rope!
Oh, my God, look at her!
I can handle it.
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
You're doing fine.
They're gone. The same pattern.
But they'll be back.
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
They won't be.
We'll worry about that when we get there.
I started to say... inside...
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
What?
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
Would you like me to go for her?
I couldn't ask you to.
I don't mind, really.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
That's the last of it.
Did you close the door?
Shhhh. Shhhh.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
He was killed last night. By birds.
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
Is that for Mitch Brenner?
Yes.
He's not home.
Well, where did he go?
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
Lovebirds.
Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds... 
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Are they moulting now?
Some of them are.
How can you tell?
What did you say?
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
But how... how do you know my name?
Ahhh, but I know you.
How?
We met in court.
We never met in court or anyplace else.
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
What kind of law?
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
Why... 
Yes?
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
Yes.
How do you know Annie?
We... we went to school together. College.
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
What did it say?
Yes, but...
You are, aren't you?
I'm sure.
Seven o'clock then.
Why did he shoot her?
What?
Oh, yes.
Will I be seeing you again?
How does Mother know what I like to do?
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.
You were lying.
I wrote the letter.
But you tore it up.
Yes.
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
I told you what happened in Rome!
Do you expect me to believe...?
It is for me.
But not for me.
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
You have a job?
I have several jobs.
What do you do?
Helping travelers.
And Fridays? What do you do then?
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
What'll it say?
You'll think me very bold, sir.
Are you all right?
Last night? What do you mean?
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
Do you want some mustard with this?
Some cream?
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
It's an uprising.
Of birds?
What it was, probably...
It's so damn quiet out there.
It was like that yesterday.
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
Melanie, Melanie...
I'm frightened, Mitch.
Melanie...
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
I think it's safe to get out now.
Don't let's take any chances.
The town looks clear.
The bay doesn't.
Do you want to try your father again? 
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Have we still got power?
Where are they heading?
Inland.
Santa Rosa?
When will they stop?
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
What time is it?
Almost two a.m.
You must be exhausted.
The power.
Mitch...
We'd better light some of those lamps.
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
Hello, Miss Daniels.
There we are!
That... that... who was that?
Have you got a pencil?
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
What were the crows after at the school?
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
For what purpose?
And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
Help how? What do you want to do?
We need them.
Not if they're starting a war.
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
Then let's go. Now!
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?  Are you coming?
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
I fear he may have to.
You asked to see me, ma'am?
I want you to help my little girl.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
Ask this one favor --
You have his promise, then?
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
Dr. MacFarlane --
I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
Well --
Gray killed her.
I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it.
She's unconscious.
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
No.
What?
Where shall we put it? In the back?
This is not a woman!
Are you a doctor, too?
Why, yes.
Aye, but I still wonder how much.
I thought this was a school day.
You'll not need that again, Georgina.
He'll not leave the grave -- not since Wednesday last when we buried the lad.
Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of Edinburgh.
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
I am the best man for the job.
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
The nerve centers -- the brain --
But what makes a thought start?
What are you going here? Have I not told you --
I've ordered nothing from you.
I take no gifts from you.
This is a gift you'll not return.
Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
I've drunk enough tonight.
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
I presume you shall.  This won't be my last visit here.
What did you hear?
Can anyone hear what we say?
You say you've come here on your own account?  No one knows you are here?
I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
"The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair.  The villain Burke, the meager Hare --"
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
Nearly a year.
Any attacks of pain since?
Yes, Doctor.
How long ago?
And why not?  He's a good lad -- bright and able.
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
Crony indeed!
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
You're not going to Gray.
I hate that picture.
Where are they? Last chance.
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
Tell her... we'll get him.
Check and mate.
Two down. Two to go.
You think I'm crazy.
What do they do that they had to kill her?
I was hoping you'd find out.
Where is it? This place?
I think we should get some support?
That was a fucking hollow point!
Think maybe knives do?
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
Sssshhh. She's resting.
You lied at my trial.
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
Wrong. Answer.
What did they give you?
What Scar? What fucking scar?
Fucking Zombie.
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
You're him. Corvis.
I was a friend of your sister's.
Daisy. How did you know?
I told you, I knew your sister.
You killed that cop Dutton.
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
This tree. Here's where it happened.
... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
So you're going to kill him?
It's ok, it's ok...
It's not. I can't take it.
... it connects you to me...
Yeah, we do.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
They botched the execution.
How about sign of a big black bird?
Just don't believe everything you see.
Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
You mean Alex.
I do. Every day.
What's with your friend there?
But you, you've had them.
You want me to walk a straight line?
I want you... to bend over.
Look, can I just call a cab?
Why are there so many?
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
Erin!
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
It still doesn't mean...
I think I dropped an earring.
You're in with them.
It's not what you think.
You killed her!
Stay away from me! Stay away!
I don't believe you.
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
I leave that in your hands.
What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
Such power exists?
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Hi Mom!
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
He gave these to you?
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Are you an FBI man?
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.
I thought that was only for bombs.
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
You think they'll ever find him?
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
You're just kidding, aren't you?
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
What does that mean?
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
All right.
Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
I don't believe it.
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
About five months -- your months.
You must have come a long way.
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.
I can judge only by what I see.
I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
It was a wonderful day.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
Hello--
I will be in just a minute.
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
Is it real?
I wonder if we ought to--
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
I don't know how to thank you.
Everyone seems so-- 
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
I want to know what he told you last night.
What happened?
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
It must be twelve-thirty.
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
Where is the meeting going to be?
"Klaatu barada nikto."
Hello.
I -- I thought you were--
You mean he has the power of life and death?
He'll have you -- and Tom.
No. That's all finished.
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
You sure about that?
Would you like to sell it?
No -- no, thanks.
The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
But I suppose you know the answer.
No -- I'm afraid not.
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
How do you like Santa Carla?
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
Can't stand light?
Yeah.
Why not?
We don't ride with vampires.
Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!
They're gaining on us!
Well... we blew Plan A.
Time to activate Plan B.
All together?
Okay.  Where's Nosferatu?
The Prince of Darkness.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
They're looking at us.
Did you see that sucker burn?!
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
Two down and two to go.
<u>Four</u> to go.
Death to all vampires!
Maximum body-count.
We are awesome monster-bashers!
The meanest!
We still going?
Honda 250, huh?
That's right.
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
We were gonna grab some food.
Don't!  Stop!
I'm my own man.
What's going' on?
Where is she?!
Hey, take it easy.
What is this, David?
Where you going?
For a ride.
With him?
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
You can't kill me, Star.
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
He's not glowing.
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
What's that smell!?
Oh, no...
What?
What happens in tow and a half hours?
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
Smells good.  When do we eat?
I told Max eight o'clock.
'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
... And stay outta here.
Thanks, Grandpa...
Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
Good!
Are we havin' fun or what?
Did we have a date tonight?
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
Hi... I'm Laddie.
It was a dream, Star.
You didn't tell David?
You like Michael.
I like Michael.
Still mad at me?
For what.
He looks dead.
He's just a deep sleeper.
I'll hitch.
Michael, are you still in bed?
Okay?
I'm tired now.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
Michael!...
We're getting close...
Ocean air!
Tell them to get something to eat.
I thought we were poor.
Help me, Mom.  Help.
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Lights out, Sam.
What's wrong?  Tell me.
Where's Michael?
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan.  The Frog Brothers.
Nanook, stop breathin' on me.
Oh, no.  Now what?
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
Ohmygod...
-- a job.
Not impressed, are you?
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
This looks terrific, Lucy.
Max!  What's wrong?
Does it burn?
Are you following me?
Well... yeah.  Sure.
Okay.  Talk.
What's your name?
Star.
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
Me, too.
I'm Michael.
Let's go see them.
I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.
When?
Why not?
Because I love you...
David's looking for me... I have to go.
You've got to put this on.
Huh?
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
It's gone.  I feel it!
What!?  He <u>can</u> and I <u>can't</u>?!  No fair!!
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
This room is mine.
I was here first.
Where are we going?
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
What would that make Mom?
Did you spill something?
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
Mom's home?...
I'm making you a sandwich.
What happened, Michael!?
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
Who are you calling?
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
What do you want from us?
Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.
Maybe dinner.
Dogs don't eat each other.
Where these tracks headed?
That night?
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
... It could have gotten to somebody...
Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
How you doin', old boy?
Watch Clark.
Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.
Somebody broke in.
Childs!!
We got to burn 'em.
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
Let's open it.
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
You catch anything he was saying?
I said where?  Where'd you go?!
Was dark... find a light...
Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!
It's shorted out or something!
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
The dogs?
MacReady!
Look, I'm just guessing...
Where's the other half?
What we going to do?!
Torch them!!
But...
MacReady!
What?
Garry's missing!
What clothes?
Then I'll have to kill you.
We should have jumped his ass.
Load of bullshit.
I think so.
Maybe we shouldn't.
Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
Anything?
Well, who's got access to it?
Would that test have worked?
Now hold him.
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
And if anyone tries to wake me...
I guess you're okay.
Nothing we can do about that.
In this weather?
Goes on like that quite awhile.  What do you gentlemen make of it?
A couple of hours.
When was the last time you used it?
I'm getting worried about you.  You ought to have a checkup.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
After all this mess then.
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
How far's that?
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
How many in their party?
Right.  Why not?
Hey, man...!
Put that down!
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
We're on fire!
Don't let up, Childs!
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
Looks good.
How long's it been?
What's...
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
How's that Thing get to the dogs?  I though we stopped it in time.
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
Somebody definitely messed with it.
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
What kind of test?
Tie up Clark, too.
Where were the flashlights?
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
Where was he trying to go?
What about Childs?
Get back!!
The generator!
Calm down and get in your position.
Maybe it ain't coming.
Then we go after him.
Get your gear on.
So what do you make of it?
You know damn well what we both make of it.
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
We should sleep in shifts.
What's happened?!
MacReady, that you?
It's the generator I think!  No power.
MacReady...?
He's one of them.
You hear that?
It must have been hard, leaving your work.
Now how did you get hurt?
I had an accident.
What do you do on the towers?
On the towers?
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
And everyone looks like us?
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
... Well, you wanted to see it.
This is it?
Yes.  Just about here.
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
Sir... have you a name?
Morlocks --
You know of them?
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
But you escaped.
I was lucky.  The others weren't.
When was his mother taken?
Last night.
Send him away.
My God... I saw this.
It frightens you.
Yes...
So, do we go on?
Yes.
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
This is the way in?
Machines?
Yes.
Vox?
What's it all for?
The air... the power.
Why did they built it?
No...
This has to end.
End...?
What's your name?
No, we created the Morlocks.
And what of the Eloi?
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
That was a foolish thing to do.
I'm tired of running.
And why not?
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
May I help you?
Got here as soon as I could.
Dance with me...
You know I can't.
You promised me flowers.
Sorry... I was distracted.
Well there's something new.
Talk away, Professor.
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
Admiration?  My my.
I mean... well... affection.
You know, the moment is rather dying here.
Got here as soon as I could.
Dance with me...
You know I can't.
Alex, what is it?
Holding you... again.
All right...
Let's walk through the park...
No... let's walk through the city.
Alex, what is it?
Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
My God...
You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
Heavens, look at that now!
Alex... people are staring.
Let them.
Do you know you were humming?
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
Tonight's the night?
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
Oh?
You wouldn't believe me.
Why don't you come to our house instead?
You won't say that in a week.
Good night, David.
This... was my home.
Did you hear me, lad?
Yes.
Is there a lot of illness?
His curiosity is amazing.
Your husband is dead?
You're not from beyond the valley.
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
How long ago?
Why?
Why not?
You seem fascinated by the stars.
You can see so many here.
Good night, then.
Yes!
We all have that dream.
All of you?
Every night.
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
This is magnificent...
Thank you.
And this is your "work"?
The mud carriers.
I can see Kalen's point.
What's it all for?
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
It must have been safe.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
You lost someone.
Yes.
Is it?
So you can use it now?
Yes... I suppose so.
Kalen...
Mara...?
Mara -- what -- ?!
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
Do you have it?!
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
Oh, I'm already swooning.
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
Here?
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
May I get you some --
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
Might I ask why?
"Eloi"?
What are your people called?
He said he traveled for two months.
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
My father has gone to a better place.
We have to go after them, find where -- !
What do you mean?!
They've gone to a better place.
You know that's not true.
Then it's time to change that --
My fowl have polluted the yard.
How did you get hurt?
What did you do at night?
We'll see about that.
I want to see your home.  Will you take me?
Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
No, you're safe --
You ok?
Then don't.
But... what about Starks?
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
We never should have done this to him...
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
He's recovering on the third floor.
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
In where?
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
And what's that?
My business?
Becker, how do you sleep at night?
You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
Do I know you from somewhere?
Did you know my father?
My father used to talk about you.
I thought you said you never knew your father.
What should they be looking for?
Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
Sure.
I need to get this letter to someone.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
Mom, he just fixed our car.
Why?
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
You two ok?
Your mom take anything before this happened?
Yeah, but I don't know what.
[Beat] What's your name?
But I like it I guess.
I think I can remember what's on them.
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
I looked it up.
It's December 25th, 1993 today.
But no one knew until after...
[Beat] You bled to death.
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
I don't believe a thing she just said.
I have no idea.
How long do we have?
They're not.
What? What are you thinking?
Then why isn't there anyone around?
They've got lives to be grateful for.
Where are we going?
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
Then, where are you going?
I've been ok.
Good. How's your mom?
How you doin'?
And if I didn't want to come?
I guess I'd ask you why.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
Why, what would you do?
I could try to...make it stop.
No. I don't want it to.
My God you look exactly like him.
I never knew my father. Did you?
How'd he get it?
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
What do you mean?
You have no idea what's going on.
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
It doesn't look all that different.
Because I don't have time.
And how do you know that?
How...how do you know?
Who...who kills me?
I'm not gonna let that happen.
You still don't believe me, do you?
I do believe you...
I tried to kill my wife.
It's gonna be sticky.
You ever been to jail?
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
Can you drive?
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
I'm not sure.
You don't have anywhere to stay?
Well, where are you from?
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
Of course you don't know.
Well, how'd you get here?
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
You want a drink?
This is pretty good. Considering...
Yup. That's me.
You like it?
[Beat] I do it.
Well, good for you.
[Beat] Why?
You don't think that's crazy?
This is a great song.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
Hon.
Uh-huh.
Hon?
'Bye, honey.  I won't wait up.
Darryl.
What?
Honey?
Why?
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
In the leg.
Who's the nut?
Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law?
I've been better.
You girls are in some hot water.
We're both fine.
Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
I have no problem with that.
Armed robber.
A .38.
Good God.
Oh shit.
What's wrong?
Stop.
What for?
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
Louise, is that you?
Well, I guess I'd better...
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
That sounds nice.
Oh.  I... where's Louise?
What did ya do?
You're a bank robber?
Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in the world are you doin' here?
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
I always knew that.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
I am funny.  I'm real funny.
Do you love me?
You're in Oklahoma?!
Tell me now.
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
Hello...
Who is it?
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?
Is this your car?
In the back?
Front.
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
What time are you gonna pick me up?
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
Okay.  I will, too.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
How come he let you go?
'Cause I didn't ask him.
How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
Oh my God.
Get the car.
Shit!  I... I, which way?
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
Just what is that supposed to mean?
It means shut up, Thelma.
I'm cash poor.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
What do you mean?
Give me the keys.
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
Will I be?
I wish we could've brought him with us.
He's got a lot to be proud of.
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
I didn't ask him to come!  It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase.
What happened to your hair?
What's wrong with you?
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.
Drive!  Drive away!
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
Holy shit.
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
You're disturbed.
Try to.
Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that?
Thelma.
I want you to call Darryl.
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
It won't work.
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.
Just past Boise City.
Now what?
You mean now or before?
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.
What?
Nothing.  It's not funny.
What?!
Harlan.
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
Thelma!
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
What?
Sorry!
Ready?
You do?
Yeah, you want it?
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
You know why.  You already said.
Louise?
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
Me too.  I feel awake.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
We can change our names.
Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look! See if that's him!
Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
What?
We've gone insane.
How far are we from Mexico?
About two hundred and fifty miles.
Shit!
What?!
What?!  What d'you think?!
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
You're a good friend.
You too, sweetie, the best.
Louise!
Where?!
What in the hell is it?!
Isn't it beautiful?!!
God!  It looks like the Army!
Now what?
We're not giving up, Thelma.
Then let's not get caught.
What are you talkin' about?
Go.
You're a good friend.
We been seein' you all along the way.
What?  What are you talkin' about?
You women are crazy!
I'm not apologizing for shit!
Say you're sorry.
Hi!
Hi there!  You alright?
We're fine!  How are you?
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
Well, uh, can you tell us his name?
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
You sent that?
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
Gay? He said you were gay?
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
Nah.
Never?
Whatever happened to Mary?
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
I mean since then.
I don't know.
Yeah, right.
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
Hey, look on the bright side --
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Wait a second, I never told you that.
Mary's a babe!
Huh? But why did Healy?
No You mean...?
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
Well then you've got to call her, man.
How the hell did you get here anyway?
Well? What are you waiting for?
Got cash.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Check.
Hm?
You know, clean the pipes.
Why's that?
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
Bob, do you remember Mary?
Who?
A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Take it easy, that's Bill.
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Here, just have one of these then.
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
Hello...? Sully...?  Sully, that you?
Who the fuck is it to you?
The sawbones?
Oh yeah.
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
You own a home there?
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
Same here again.
Don't you want to know my name?
I already know it, Mary.
How'd you know that?
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
Some buildings I'm working on.
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
-- He's in a cage?!
Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now?
Fine. Fine.
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
That...? Vestibule.
And it doesn't cramp your style?
Mary ah, forget it.
Come on, what were you going to say?
Urrggghh...
All you want is a phone number?
Well, I know you're busy...
I don't buy it.
No.
She's blackmailing you, right?
You want her dead, don't you?
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
I think your life's about to change.
So she's married?
Nope. Never been.
Huh?
Four kids, three different guys.
What are you doing?
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
Hey, hey, hey!
You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?
What do you mean 'why'?
Do what?
Turn her over to a stalker.
Oh Christ... poor dog.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Harvard?
You bet.
Did you study under Kim Greene?
Among others.
Kim and I are close friends!
Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
You know, I really should take your card.
I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
How'd you manage that one?
That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
How many is that?
Ho-ly shit.
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
You little fuck.
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
Oh. Well I am.
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
It means you're too hard on guys.
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
So who's the lucky guy?
What's a mook?
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
I'm buying bananas tonight.
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
Holy shit...
Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
Pat does projects all over the world.
Oh yeah. Fine.
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
No, it's an old football injury.
Huh?
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
Hi, Ted.
Are you all right?
Ted, are you okay?
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
By the way, how's he doing?
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Hey.
You look great.
What's that?
Sure.
What are you?
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
So you're a writer?
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
That you put a murderer on my trail?
Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.
Please leave.
Mary, come on...
Go!
What what are you doing here?
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
Get over here.
Really?
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you doing?!
I, uh... I got it stuck.
Is it the frank or the beans?
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
Teddy, hon, are you okay?  OH HEAVENS TO PETE!
What do you mean?
No, no, please!
Ho there.
Hey.
So what's up?
Okay.  So is that a yes or a no?
Franks and beans!
How are you doing, Warren?
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
See you, Warren.
See you, Warren.
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
Tomorrow...
Good.
Well, I'm not.
Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
Oh, still sore about this.
Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.
Where've you been? We've been trying to find you all morning.
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
Slow down. Smell that?
Yeah?
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
What's it about?
Then they should speak up.
That is correct.
And the second condition?
John. How much time?
Still heading for Cuba.
How's my favorite President?
Busy. But you've got his heart.
I want an hour with him.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
Secretary of Defense...
Hey, sport. You winning?
Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.
What about you? Where are you going?
I was eating that.
No you weren't.
Still think Cuba isn't important?
Should be here any minute.
Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
I don't care. Cancel it.
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support.
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
Bob. Bet you had a late night.
Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Just a second, Mr. President.
Hey.
Yeah.
I thought we were staying on the reservation.
FBI? What you investigatin'?
A murder. On the reservation.
What's this about?
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
It ain't Geronimo.
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
What journey?
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
This is a restricted area.
I did.
Who the fuck is he?
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
No. That's Ray here. Ray...
Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
Couldn't sleep.
Maisy Blue Legs place?
How'd you know?
I got one up on ya.
Let's see it.
That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
Her oil pan is shot.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
Thanks, Cooch.
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
Tread matches. It's the car.
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
Why?
You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
Ray...
I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
What are you --
What?!
Bullshit.
-- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
What did he say?
What was he saying?
Why should I tell you.
And...
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
Red Deer Table, Ray.
Take care of yourself, Walter.
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
Cuz I'm a skin?
Cuz you're a cop.
Not no more.
Still after Jimmy?
You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
Crow Horse, listen --
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
Well, it was just a dream, I --
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
What do you mean?
Sorry.
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones.
What's that?
Ray. Ray, don't let go now, Man. Ray...
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?
You're the Indian FBI.
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
X22. Read.
I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
Come back?
Ray. X22.
X21. Come back.
What are you doing on the reservation?
Ray...
Do you want a coffee?
I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
No way. No fuckin' way.
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
Well, it is. It is that, too.
That's a big comfort to me.
I could be, too.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
I thought he'd never leave.
Everybody's got to be somewhere.
It would have been really embarrassing!
Why not?
I saw one.
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
Where did you see that?
Yes, ma'am.
Where were you?
Two miles.
The what?
It never came up.
No.
What would you say, too fast...too quick...
And far too aggressive.
I'm special.
Yes. I'll give you that!
Lieutenant...
Evan... or Maverick.
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
Uh hum.
How about anything, anything you want to do.
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
What about the plane?
Used to what?
I'm different.
Let's make it at eight.
Make what?
Why'd you do that?
It dies. We live.
You're an animal.
That's true. What are you?
No!
It's not suffering anymore.
You ever think about killing another human being?
It's just as I thought.
You're totally insane.
Come on.
Where?
And now?
And now I want you.
You always get what you want?
I want it understood.
Food...and you...my F-14!
In that order?
Well no...inverse order.
Danger?
. Yeah!
Doesn't it ever bother you?
Just good luck.
Where'd you get it.
I'm fine.
This is it, then.
That's not what I hear.
I was flying...my responsibility.
That's what you get flight pay for.
You don't have to do this.
Do what, show you a good time?
No.
I want it back.
You don't believe that.
What do you do when you come here?
What kind of games?
Want to play the game?
Goose is dead.
True.
Now?
Off me or off you?
That's three.
One more.
Looks like a tie.
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
I know exactly what you mean.
Well?
I live here, remember?
Yes sir. I do, Sir.
Yes sir.
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
F-14's sir.
Tomcats?
Lieutenant... Is there... a Russian attack?
Yes, Sergeant?
Remember one thing.
Can't shake him.
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
MAVERICK.
YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
Let's hope you're right!
What is he doing?
That's missile lock!
He better be kidding!
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
This is crazy!
What is?
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
What?  What is it?
Were upside down!
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
I'm pulling up.
We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down.
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
What are you doing?
Okay, okay.
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
Yawing right.
I know!
Rudder's left, stick's forward.
I've got it -- hold on!
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
What are you talking about, we gotta go!
Gotta go, man.
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
You go. I'm staying with it.
Is there something I should know?
Just relax.
Is it the plane?
The plane is fine.
You're not supposed to...
But I have to!
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
Well what?
What do you want?
What do I want?
What do you want?
Well, I don't know. That depends.
Like what?
Did what?
The list is long, but distinguished.
So's my Johnson.
So I've heard.
Who's your pilot?
No shit. The Iceman....
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
How was it?
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
You ever done this before?
We did it!
Come on, we're next.
Something bothering you?
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
What what are you doing? We're cover!
I'm pinned to the panel.
3000 feet. I'll do it.
1000.
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
I was a victim of circumstance.
What'd you do?
Hear about Ice?
What now?
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH.
ON THE NOSE?
I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD TONE ON IT.
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
I guess I owe you one.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
You saved our lives. You did it!
Figured it out yet?
Figured out what?
Who is the best.
Nope.
I think I can work it out on my own.
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
Just below ten thousand.
I don't know what to tell you, Skip.
I've seen this before.
So have I.
Who's the hell is that?
I...FORGOT SOMETHING.
What the hell you doing?
You won?!!!
It was bad.
Morning, Coogan.
Was going.  Now you are.
Yes sir..
Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
Yes sir.
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
Then why are you here?
For the same reason you are.
How do you feel?
All right.
No bother.
Or....
Or you can quit.
I'm nothing like him.
You may not think so, but you are.
I never heard that.
Not something they tell dependents.
What's wrong with this one?
Where's yours?
Over there man.
Welcome to Mars.
What to the rebels want?
So, where to?
The Last Resort.
First time on Mars?
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
Lemme ask you a question.  Ever fuck a mutant?
Need a ride?
And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
But maybe you can change all that.
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.
How'd you find me?
Thank you.
Get it, please.
Well, my boy, you're a hero.
So why am I still alive?
Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet.
What the fuck is going on down there?!
If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
He had help.  From our side, sir.
I know that.
Stop fighting and get out.
Bob?
What is it?
I'm with an very important client.
Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Why not?
Good evening...  Doug.  I'm Dr. Lull.
So, been married long?
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
Blonde, brunette, redhead?
Brunette.
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
Sleazy...and demure.
Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.
Amazing.  Where are we?
Suppose I do...then what?
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
Not since you lost him.
Quaid!  That's Quaid!
Pull them out.
Where's Kuato?
What, aliens?
You tell me.
Shit!
They found us!  Everybody out!
Rekall?
They sell fake memories.
Oh, Rekall.
I don't know.  Maybe.
What trip?
You went to Rekall, remember?
What are you, my father?
Let me buy you a drink.
Harry, what the hell is this?
Come on, let's go have that drink.
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Where?
Are you saying she liked it?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
Where is he?
Shit!
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
I've got a weak signal over there.
He's not at ground level.
I've got a lock!  There!
Look at this shit.
I'm sorry.  Would you please rephrase the question.
How did I get in this taxi?!
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
Would you please repeat the destination?
The fare is eighteen credits, please.
Quit while you're ahead.
Is that better?
The brunette.  The one you told me about.
Who is she?
Nobody.
It's not funny, Doug.  You dream about her every night.
...You mean it?
Yeah, sweetheart?
Let's do it.
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
And you believe him?
Well...What do you say?
What are you doing?
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
You went to those brain butchers?!
What did they do to you?  Tell me!
--I got a trip to Mars.
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
Not talk!  I said TALK!!
I'm not your wife.
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
It was implanted by the Agency.
And falling in love?
I didn't know you were so kinky.
I suppose you're not here either.
Doug...Bob McClane.
Nice to meet you.
Mars.
As real as any memory in your head.
I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!
I don't remember you.
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
Hauser left me a note.
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
Why would I lie to you?
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
I think you better leave.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
I thought you didn't like me.
Now what?
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
Not bad, for a hooker.
I don't need Kuato for that.
Are you all right?  Are you still you?
Where are you going?!
The reactor.
Where's this "reactor" come from?
Aliens built it.
You sure about this?
Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.
Or a big mother slug maybe?
You guys all set?
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
Yeah, like they got a plan...
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
Yeah, still got one poking around.
How much you think?
What the hell is that, anyway?
Cannon fuse.
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
Knock it off, Burt!
A beauty, isn't it?  We bought three of them for the rec room.
That's fine.  We've got some new things to teach them.
She's got my vote.
BACK OFF, BURT...!
Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French.
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
Oh my God.
He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!
We're not going over there, right?
So...now what?
Howdy, Rhonda.
You're really leaving, huh?
You didn't cook breakfast?
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.
You're gonna get us hung up.
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
So long, cactus!
Jeez, look at that guy.
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Reckon he hated Perfection more than us?  You suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
Jesus!  I don't <u>believe</u> this!
You're hung up again.
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
Fifteen lousy bucks.
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
We'll take your word for it.
God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
Well, folks, what's the plan?
Don't he have a home to go to?
You're right, don't matter where they come from.
I'm gonna kick his ass!
Shut it up!  Shut the little bastard up!
Its tires are flat...
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
<u>I'm</u> making the run to the Cat.
Like hell you are.
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
Watch your ass, shithead.
Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
They're...they're trying to make us move!
What the hell are you doing?!!
Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!
Yeah...but no ties.
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
Well, I brung her something I know she likes.
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
Hi, guys, what you been up to?
Burt!  Heather!
We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
The con...!  Oh my God.
Well, what's wrong with it?
You sure this is where it was?
Come on.  Get away from it!
Twenty.
Darn it!
Think it's still following us?
Ready?
What's it doing?
What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
It worked!  There they go!
I brought it... to the coroner.
You're fishing. You don't know shit.
...we had to lick his boots clean.
That-a-boy. Hospital.
Or this -- is this a significant difference?
Forensic ballistics isn't an exact science, is it?
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
Ms. Vin's sister.
I have to talk to your brother.
Gimme back my bottle.
Don't hurt him.
Where's the nearest hospital?
-- With objection!
Your Honor, that's not fair -- !
Objection.
You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable.
"Art's Supplies" is founded on trust, Mister --
I can describe it.
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
How can you remember that?
Not the whole time, of course. I --
We had a description of the suspect.
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
No. No...
Right. You're right.
I specialize, Roger...
...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense?
We're taking the other case.
What other case?
When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?
That DD-5.
What, the lunatic who --
They're just frightened, fucked-up losers that prison fucked up worse.
I didn't ask for a closing argument.
Eddie Dowd.
1530 Rivington Street.
So what're we gonna do?
I'm not that desperate.
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
Eddie -- it's Art Esparza!
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
-- What?
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
...For ten years, now.
They're Chinamen who speak English. We call them informants.
Murder witness.
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
I haven't thanked you for your work, Kitty. You're doing good work.
I haven't paid you.
Got any booze in the house?
You don't drink "booze".
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.
My mother find you?
That's right.
Want to tell me what went down here?
Racist asshole came at me.
Exactly what happened then?
I killed the motherfucker.
But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
But why?
Maybe... because someone's afraid.
Afraid of what?
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
-- About what?
About Chinatown. What went down.
What went down?
You tell me, man.
No. You tell me, Shu.
How can I tell you what I don't know!
No.
...I'm dying out there.
It was self-defense.
-- How could I help you?
'lo, Cecil.
No, s-sir.
I'd l-like to answer the question.
Edward T. Dowd.
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.
In those days, they often worked as a team.
-- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
Shouldn't one of us...?
What do you want?
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
Look. Mister --
Five years.
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
For control of the prison drug trade?
Yeah, we do some of that.
"Name, rank and serial," Mr. Ortega. Let's not hide behind the Fifth.
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
Shu's the only one I know of...
And why was an exception made?
The phone company was broken up.
A woman.
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
I want you to kill for me.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
Here he comes.
What was?
The stuff we got last night.
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
That's not the way to Cliff's trailer. I told you.
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
Well, where are you going?
I am going over here.
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
You try that you little monkey.
Congratulations. I heard about that.
HE'S GONE.
Teresa Banks.
Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?
I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
And no one found the ring?
Where is the ring?
Someone else has it now.
That would indicate that it's the future.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
Where's Hap?
He's dead -- good and dead.
Sorry to hear it.
Any friends?
Did she ever mention any friends?
How come Jack let's you work here?
No.
That was really something.  That dancing girl.  What did it mean?
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
Sort of shorthand.
Shorthand. Really?
We're heading into a difficult situation.
Lil was wearing a sour face.
What did Gordon's tie mean?
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
It's late, Sam.
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
She lived alone.
You better dust this place, Sam.
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
You didn't do your homework?
When?
The usual, 9:15.
He probably wanted to drive over.
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
Maybe.
Oh god, Laura.
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Maybe I better start our homework.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Donna, are you my best friend?
Do you want to talk?
If I can smoke it.
You want a muffin?
Goodbye, Muffin.
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
Where are the Cookies?
You mean Fred and Ginger?
What are you doing?
No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.
No, you should forget about last night.
You're not mad at me?
What can I tell you?
How did the car get back here?
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
Why do you do it, Laura?
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
What'll it be?
Fill 'er up.
You got it.
Nice night.
You missed somethin', Ed.
I did? I didn't see anything.
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
But Bob isn't real.
No... No...
I'm not.
Did you make me a tape?
No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.
I am The Muffin.
Right on time, baby.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
We're on our way, Baby.
Why? It does.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
We were supposed to be together.
How can I be together if I'm not together?
I've got to see you.
Not now.
What about tonight?
I can't tonight.
What the hell is wrong with you?
What do you mean?
You know it and I know it.
Everything, but everything.
Oh, Laura.
You always hurt the ones you love.
What?
When he finds out.
What?
You want to see...
Boating?
No.
Hiking?
No.
Eating?
You'd think so.
Sex?
You're getting warmer.
What are you afraid of? What people think?
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
I understand.
Can I take the car?
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
Laura.
I hate asparagus.
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
Good night, Mom.
Hi, honey, how's Donna?
Fine.
School?
Let me see.
Who was that?
A friend from school.
We're late to get to your mother.
Are you sure you're okay?
Dad?
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
I always thought you knew it was me.
Leland, what are you doing?
Did you get this from your lover?
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
Who am I?
I don't know.
What's wrong?
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
I'm kind of busy, Norma.
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
You're right. There's no one here.
There's no one here.
Mr. Abraham...
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
What did he find?
How good's your intelligence?
Four cases in three years...
The man's an ambulance chaser...
How did you settle on the amount?
We thought it was just.
You thought it was just.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
And no one will know the truth.
What are you doing here?
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
...yes. Get her on the phone...
...he wants to testify...?
It looks that way.
To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
This is going to drive the ante up.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
I wouldn't do it.
You would not...?
Yes.
Just now...
That's not my handwriting.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
I thought I would need it.
Just as you are, Sir...
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
No.
Neurology?
No.
Orthopedics?
I'm just an M.D.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I know of him.
How is that?
What book is that?
Meth... Methodology and Technique...
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
How old are you?
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
I did.
Ed Concannon.
Objection, we've...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Mr. Concannon...?
Nothing further, your Honor.
No further questions.
No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Yes.
Say it.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
Anything special about the case?
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
Well, many reasons, actually...
Tell me one?
That's right.
And what did your team do...
You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
I completely understand...
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
I didn't do too well for you.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
The Doctors were not negligent.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
She getting good care over there?
'Code Blue'...
I. Yes. It is.
And you wrote that...
Dr. Gruber...
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
Yes.
Her doctors killed her.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
Hi.
How old is he?
Who told you that?
Mrs...
Mrs. Simmonds.
Kathy Price...
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
Yes.
One hour.
I did.
A single hour.
Yessir. I'm sorry.
Why is that?
What is it?
Thank you for seeing me.
I need an extension for my case.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
Ready, your Honor.
Nothing further, your Honor...
I object, your Honor...
Overruled...
D'you find an apartment?
I changed my life today. What did you do?
Why?
The TV didn't work.
What Hotel are you staying at?
And what are you? A cop?
I'm a lawyer.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Really. How wonderful for you.
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
Maybe what?
What...?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
I've got to work...
Do you want me to go...?
Why don't you get some rest?
Do you think it's my fault?
You're talking like a drunk.
And it's over...?
Well, then what are you doing here?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Is there going to be a later...?
Joe...  Joe...
Is it over?
What are you going to do?
Thank you.
Continental Casualty...
Mr. Galvin's...
Hello, I'm calling from...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
From the magazine?
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
How come you're calling me from...?
This is Miss Costello...?
Yes. Price...
Pardon?
Kathy Price.
We find that your subscription lapsed...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
I've got nothing to say to you.
You know what happened.
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
I didn't do it, Mister.
Who are you protecting, then?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
Then why don't you testify?
It's locked.
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
...You saw her?
Dr. Gruber.
He's not in, Sir.
Well, well, well. Huh?
It's a long road that has no turning.
Come on. Let's get a drink.
Are you out of your mind...?
Mick. Mick. Mick...
Right.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
You got a good memory, Franky.
Jimmy? Bushmills.  Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
What happened, Joey...?
I can't talk now.
Yeah? How's our new witness?
You use their witness.
Are you with me... are you awake...?
Yeah. I'm awake.
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
Uh... the admitting nurse...
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
The broad has disappeared...
What the hell are you doing here?
What are you doing in New York...?
She told me.
She did?
I just saw her.
In New York?
Dr. Towler...
Yes, that's correct.
Yes.
...of the procedures...
As I've said we had some more...
What happened in those three...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
What happened in those three minutes...?
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Yes.
How'm I doing so far?
Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.
It's an enemy sneak attack.  Let's get outta here!
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
We'd be in all the papers!
Hey, there - open up!
Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
Hey, you!  Better get outa here!
I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...
You look kinda lost yourself.
Is that it over there?
Did you see it come down?
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
Did it do you any good?
What's he like?
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
Can you handle one of these?
Is that... machine...?
It's gone now.
Don't you live at home?
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
How long was I out?
Nothing there now.
It was...  ...one of them!
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
Colonel - shooting's no good!
That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.
D.O. to number three..come in.
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
Must be somebody in there.
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
Maybe these are not men - not like us.
What'll we say to 'em?
Which means he's having nightmares again?
He's very excited about it.
You mean that was a...
So I don't know about horror.
Come on.  Kids love horror.
And I...I've got other things happening.
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
I don't follow.
One of mom's cups got broken.
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
You get any sleep last night?
Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
Guess so.
Heather?
What's up?
He's had some sort of...episode.
Like what?
Like Freddy.
I'll be there in three hours.
No.
Diabetes?
I want my kid out of here now!
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
No way he's going anywhere.  He's been well sedated.
no.
Someone's coming.
Rex saved me.
This is going to give you nightmares.
Tomorrow night.
Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
He's on his way.
In my bed.
Do you have to die to see God?
Why does God let there be bad things?
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
Home.
Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
Dylan, where's the man?
What...what is that?
You okay?
Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
Darker.  More...evil?
You didn't jump in.
Freddy, for all I know.
John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
I know how Chase really died.
What are you talking about?
Fred Krueger did it.
Heather Langenkamp?
I want to see the body.
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
The car's no there yet?
I'm sorry, I can't.
Listen, dammit.
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
Heather, what is it?
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
It can be captured, sometimes.
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know?
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
Can I get you something to drink?
Black's fine.
Did we lose anybody?
That low passed through last night. May be a little bumpy out there.
Looks like weather.
He would have loved this.
He knows.
You sound so sure.
You may not like what you hear.
Why did we begin this?
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
What are they doing?
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
Everyone aboard young Bill?
Yes, Sir.
Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?
Well, that's all part of it.
Carry on.
Why didn't you drop any sail?
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
How old are you, son?
It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!
Make us proud.
Albatross?
She isn't that old.
Where you going?
Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
Believe what?
You okay?
Ninety-six.
Congratulations.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Feels different doesn't it?
What was that?
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
I thought this was your dream come true.
That's not why he's sending me.
Why then.
Hey, shut up will ya?
Why'd you do it?
What's the difference?
Can we talk?
Well that's just typical isn't it?
Listen man, I think I have a problem.
We all have problems.
Do you have your ticket?
Yes.
Passport?
Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.
What the hell is going on?
How ya doing?
Fine.
I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
Do what?
Where are you from any way?
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
Who told you that?
My dad.
Jesus, you never told them?
What are they doing?
I can't go in there.
Ah... Northeast... sir.
Northeast sir!
Yes, sir.
You all right?
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
What's on your mind?
Can't do it.
Why do you think I'm sending him home?
The Dolphin was a symptom.
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
Chicken is a fool's game captain.
So is violating international law.
But you invited is aboard.
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
And, of course, we are.
What is it we can do for you today?
What's wrong, you don't like steak?
I should be eating with the crew.
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
I can take care of myself.
It has nothing to do with him.
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
You do?
What?!  What's happening?!!
Son-of-a-bitch.
What's that?
Jesus.  She's got guns.
Me, too.
Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.
What's your problem?
Don't ever call me stupid.
If you've got "a broad" available I'll take her.
How would you know?
Trust me donut.  I know.
They tell you that?
It matters to me.
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
Tie it off!!
We've got a problem.
Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress.
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.
You're the one who doesn't care, Phil.
It hurts too much to care.
About yourself?
How long you been standing there?
What are we supposed to talk about?
You've gotta be kidding?
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
No way Phil.  Not like this.
No.
I'm not gonna kill it.
Swing up, son.
What?
What's it going to be?
I'm sorry...
What are you blubbering about?
Are you hating this?!  Are you!
What makes you so sure it was one?
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
They are much more than that, sir.
I understand.
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
And you didn't do anything about it?
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
Easy for you to say.
Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
I can dig this music... But not that singer.
This be it?
Y'all take American Express?
What's Cao Ben?
How old are you?
Hey, pretty woman... Sailor here?
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
I'm from all over.
Need a hand?
How 'bout a beer?
That'd be fine, Bobby.
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
Sorry to hear it.
You black?
No.
You an indian?
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
Ready for another?
When did you talk to Lula?
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
...But DAMN man... This better go smooth.
What's she doin' here?
Why should it?
That's right... Take one of these.
Nice of you to drop by.
Told ya I would. You still riled?
Ain't never had no girl pull a blade on me.
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
You heard from Reggie?
Used to.
What'd you say?
That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up...
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
Mostly black though in that boogie place.
What's the name of it?
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
No... She's fine. Back home.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
You hitched yet?
No big buildings like in New Orleans.
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
That is my permiso.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
The Good Witch...
...Asshole.
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?
Hasta siempre.
Gotta admit, you guys are -  two in four dozen.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
Who was that?... Who know's your here?
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
That bastard Pucinski...
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
I'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.
You won't of missed much.
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
Why we sittin' here, mama?
I'm scared, mama.
Hey baby...
I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Sailor?
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.
You mean like pedal pushers?
You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.
Come look at this.
Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it!
What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
You got me, peanut.
I really do think it's the best night of my life.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
Who do?
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
Just part of life on the road, peanut.
You ready for this?
How much we got left, honey?
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
Yeah, I'm here.
There's worse places, honey.
If you say so.
I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
What's that?
Oh God, Sailor.
One bad car accident...
Let's get ahold a' her quick.
Sailor?
That you, Sail, honey?
You sick?
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Yeah?
Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
And Bobby too, I hear...
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
Oughta make 'em happy.
So where'd you say you was?
Sail?
Uh-huh?
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
What could I be up to, Lula?
That was in Vietnam.
He's the kind liked it.
You must be my son.
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
How can you say that, Sailor?
LULA!!!!
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
Just a place.
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
You're comin' home, precious. Santos' gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Course I am, mama.
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
What if I asked you not to?
Wouldn't make any difference.
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
That's not why I called.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
Have it your way... But you want it.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
Take care of him?
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
Get rid of him?
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
Simple? Kill him? How?
That's your business... I don't care how.
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Santos...
Shoot him.
Yes.
Where? In the leg?
No.
Where?
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
Yes.
Through the forehead?
See! I knew you had it all under control.
Put your shoulders back.
You got nice tits.
That's just another part of the price to pay.
Santos... Where's J-J-Johnnie?
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
By who?
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
You really are one dumb asshole.
I know... I remember.
Well?...
I ain't heard of nothin'.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
You snore.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
Thank you.
Tripp!
Emily?
Your wife.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
She's a transvestite.
She's still a transvestite.
Mm.
I thought you were tinkering.
You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??
Trip??
She left me. Crabs.
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
He has a book.
I know. He started it Fall semester.
So. Is he any good?
No. Not yet he isn't.
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
That was good.
Tripp.
Yes.
What's this guy's problem?
Wait here. I'll be right back.
Tripp?!
You stay there.
Kidnapped? By who?
His parents.
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
It's a little late to call Admissions.
Which is?
So modest.
Crabtree.
Shut up, James.
Who do you think it is?
The Chancellor's here? Now?
So -- what do we do now?
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
Want some help with that?
So whose car is it?
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
Such as.
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
Kind of a sign, you're saying.
The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.
Do you know he won't expel him?
You driving this car?
It's mine.
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
You must be mistaken.
I passed out.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
How long have you been having them?
The last month maybe.
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
I've been trying to finish a book...
She told you about...
Her dog, yes.
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
Better luck next time.
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
No. There's no one here.
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Who's got a gun?
Who the hell is that?
Sure.
Sara? Hi. It's Grady.
You're in Kinship?
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
Goodbye, Grady.
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
Sounds like a good one.
It's colder in there.
I'll miss my bus.
Is that really it?
Go ahead.
Really?
They're glass. The buttons.
It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
I had to. Didn't I?
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
Whose tuba is that anyway?
Can I ask you something about her?
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
Thank you.
Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
Want me to get that?
He didn't give his name.
Who?
The guy on the phone.
What'd you tell him?
Afraid so.
That's a big book you're writing.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
Washed up?
Professor Tripp?
How's that?
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
So where have you been staying?
Who?
Isn't this...?
I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.
She seemed to take it pretty well.
Humboldt County?
Glaucoma?
Colon cancer.
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
Outside Scranton.
What kind of dancer?
Kinship.
Kinship. And what's here?
The one that left you?
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
How can you tell?
Jealous? Of me?
You're lying.
Want a bite?
What would you call them then?
It's because you don't eat.
I eat.
When?
Where you going?
I'm not going, with them.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
And we both thank you for that, but we're... we're... fine.
Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
Professor Tripp...?
Thanks for that. He all right?
I think so... What about you?
Me? Sure. Why?
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.
Hey.
Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
He cribbed that from Borges.
That good, huh?
Professor Tripp.
I got the message you called.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
You go first.
All right. This morning --
I'm sure.
Emily left me this morning.
Is that Cristaile?
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
Is the thing -- is it over?
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
Who's gun is that?
Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
Pow.
You got me.
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
I heard.
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
Really? That was fast.
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
About the baby.
Who's that sitting in your car?
James Leer.
What's he doing out there?
Inside.
And the jacket?
Are you sure you parked it there?
I think I might have.
And what do you think you might have said?
He told you.
He told me.
And what did you say?
I lost it all.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
I know.
Ouch. How many?
Did you tell Walter?
Does he still love you?
You don't deserve me, you know.
Why yes. How did you know?
That's a nice greenhouse.
Who's he barking at now?
I need a ride.
I'm not sure that's possible.
Listen, Antonia --
He's writing his name in water.
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
Who's this ?
Grady?
It's three-thirty, Grady.
This is important.
Oh?
I... I...
What is it, Grady?
I'm in love with your wife.
Excuse me?
Is it good?
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
Who's that guy?
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
Yo, Traxler.
Do you get high, Sam?
Holy shit. Are you serious?
As a heart attack.
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
What made you pull out that old thing?
I was thinking of you.
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
Where you stand?
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
A jockey? You mean, like --
No, the dog.
I might have his number on campus.
Are you riding with me, James?
There's so many...
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
You want to keep him happy.
Don't need to think fast to handle beer.
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
Foreman now.
No shit.
Five years.
Hey, is that a school?
Something wrong with that?
I was just thinking of... the noise.
One hundred and twenty feet.
How is she?
Annette? She's good... tense.
When can I see her?
I'm working on it.
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
What are you doing?
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.
What party?
No thanks.
I've got some good news.
What's that?
Aren't you glad?
When?
Soon.
Next week? The week after?
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
You don't have to tell me this.
I'm just talking, man.
Carlos, I never raped a woman.
Sure.
Nothing.
Ask me. Ask me anything.
What do you mean?
What are you looking at?
Birds.
There's a million birds here.
They're starlings.
Is that right?
I don't like starlings.
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
A solitary vireo. I like that one.
Their sound is quite musical.
How does it sound?
It's hard to describe.
I can't.
I'd love to hear it.
Something like that.
You should hear the bird.
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
I have to go.
Do you come here often?
My daddy likes me home before dark.
What are you writing in that book?
Don't you have friends?
I'm not pretty.
Hiya, Walter.
What's up?
You don't know?
I have no idea.
I think you do.
I haven't broken any laws.
I would.
Got something to hide?
Doesn't everybody?
I could get a search warrant.
Cherry?
Okay?
Too much sun.
You walked home.
Fairy tales?
Do you believe in them?
The one with the ax?
What?
You don't know?
I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
I wasn't feeling well.
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
What's with the boxes?
You're a cop. Figure it out.
I'd say you're moving.
The passionate one?
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
I count my blessings.
So. How are you adjusting?
And your new apartment?
Apartment's okay.
Are you taking your medication?
It gives me headaches.
But you are taking it?
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?
I'd keep away from him.
Have you seen Walter?
People have the right to know.
Yeah, like the bird.
I'm twelve.
Walter.
Do you have many friends?
It sounds like you were banished.
Robin?
No thank you.
Are you sure?
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
Does he?
What's her name?
I can't.
But will he... ?
Your daddy will always love you.
I know because... it's just something I know.
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
Walter?
No.
I don't mind.
You should go home.
Can't I stay a little longer?
It's getting dark. Go home.
And how's your job?
I said the job is okay.
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
You seem a little hostile today.
A diary?
That's right.
No way.
I don't understand.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
Of course.
It was just an idea.
Reflect.
That's right.
You think reflection is good.
It's very good, indeed.
Try it.
No fucking way.
How's the journal?
I'm still thinking about it.
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name.
How do you feel about that?
Then why are you talking about this?
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
I'm not that crazy.
Why do you think you're here?
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
Is that what you are angry about?
How long is this going to take?
We have a few more minutes.
I mean, when will I be normal.
Will I ever be normal?
I couldn't say.
You couldn't say.
I'm afraid not.
I suppose it's however society defines it.
How do you define it?
They usually tell me.
How do they know?
What is your idea of being normal?
Fuck you, Rosen!
I know --
You don't know!
I don't know.
What did you think would happen?
I don't know.
What did you want to happen?
Is this the first one?
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
I want to talk about it now.
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
You're very late.
Sorry.
Please don't do it again.
When did it all start?
I don't know.
That's not a helpful answer.
To relax.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
I don't see --
Who do you see?
Not so fast.
Where are you?
How old are you and your sister?
And what are you doing?
What the hell are you doing there?
Don't ever do that again.
I don't like nobody behind my back!
This is garbage!
You felt pleasure.
Did you get an erection?
I was six years old!
It was a small house.
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
How do you feel about that?
What?
Are you okay?
Want a ride?
I'm all right.
What picture?
I'm talking about you.
Me?
What's weird about that?
Most women wouldn't choose it.
You're quiet at work.
Neither do you.
You never spoke to me before.
Are you?
Southern light.
Is that a school?
K through sixth.
Doesn't it get noisy?
What about bears?
What about them?
They could eat you.
What?
I'm not easily shocked.
I get that impression.
So... what's your dark secret?
Why do you want to know?
So?
So, you're not a dyke.
Hey, that was... intense.
You're still here.
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
You think I have a problem?
Do you?
It's been a while since...
Tell me about it.
Maybe later.
How about in the morning.
The morning?
I thought I'd stay the night.
Did I say something wrong?
I suffer from insomnia.
Hey, there.
Why do you want to know?
The worst?
So, what did you do?
I molested little girls.
Molested little girls?
You're not joking.
What did you do to them?
It's not what you think.
I never hurt them. Never.
Why don't you just go now, okay?
What?
Get your kicks somewhere else.
Hey, I'm not --
Depraved? My mistake.
You don't really --
I've changed.
Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...
Their power. They seduce me.
They seduce you?
I was always the one seduced.
You really believe that?
No. That's what I used to tell myself.
And what do you tell yourself now?
You know, this is crazy.
What?
Being here, with me.
What odds?
I got poked around... here and there.
All three -- in chronological order.
You must hate your brothers.
I love my brothers.
You never asked them about it?
Are you serious?
Not ever?
What?
I'm not scared.
Neither am I.
We should live together.
Live together.
It's a bad idea.
I've got problems.
Guess that makes you pretty special.
What's this?
Thank you.
Don't be scared, Walter.
I'm not scared.
Don't do that.
Do what?
Sneak up behind me like that.
What's your fucking problem?
What's going on?
Do you want to talk about it?
You okay?
Yeah.
I heard they were filthy birds.
Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.
She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
You done impressing yourself, ace?
How you guys doing?
You got it?!  You got it?
Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
Lord Almighty.
Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.
I can't believe you let them do this!
Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
You never did like being called that, did you?
You wanna know what I think?
I think you were worried about me.
I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
What are you still wearing that for?
I haven't worn mine in months.
Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
But what did he see that made him panic?
What do you think he saw?
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
I think it likes you.
He's jammed the mechanism.
Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
You totaled it, huh?
Well, that's that.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
You see where it's coming in?
Son of a bitch!
How?
I don't know how!
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
Oh God, Lins... I--
Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?
'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
Hello, Brigman.
We'll go in through that large breach.
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
Did you find Wilhite?
Virgil?
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
Got it. Over.
Is that it?  Is this right?
He's convulsing!
'Fish'?
We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.
Quiet!  Quiet!
SHIT!
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
Cab One, radiation readings?
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
How many are there?
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
Uh, oh...
Hey!
Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
Would we see the flash?
But your friend is waiting downstairs.
How are you?
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
But where are you going?
You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.
Which one shall I wear?
This one is gorgeous.
I'm certainly not going to swim across.
And how long will you be away?
And have you any other truths to tell me?
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
What is that one over there called?
Well?
Well, what?
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
More so than the shark?
I have a feeling that you're not used to being alone.
Don't be so humble.
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
Are you feeling better?
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
Yes, very much so.
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Yes.
Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.
And what about you?
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
But why am I so infatuated with you?
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
Then I'll see you later.
Sandro ...What's the matter?
No, Sandro... Please...
Why?
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
Aren't you going to change?
Sandro, I'm not coming down.
Why?
Good night, my love.
I love you.
Tell me once more.
Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
I would say he's pretty depraved.
Have you ever been in love?
What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
You say that just to flatter me.
I'm not coming.
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
What do you mean by sensible?
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
Who are you talking to?
Please, you come too...
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.
Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?
It's as smooth and slick as oil.
At one time the Aeolian isles were all volcanoes.
I'll stay here also.
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift?
But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
First let the poor thing have something to eat.
Ettore...
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
Where is she going?
Giulia...
Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman.
And where do you find the models?
Why don't you try?
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
We have a radio like this, too.
Anything new develop?
And do you remember where she got off?
Are you the owner of this place?
No. The owners are in Australia.
Whose boat is that?
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
And how come you're up so early?
Did you manage to find good rooms?
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Why have we stopped?
You've made some mistake there with the bushes... that's why you can't finish it.
Zuria?
Yes. Until proven otherwise.
I would like to ask you something.
She costs a hundred thousand lire.
You really must do me this one favor.
He talked to you Himself?
No.
Through someone else?
Yes.
Who?
I can't say.
Why?
She'd punish me.
One of the other Sisters?
Because I'm getting fat.
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
Agnes...
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
He loves you the way you are.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
Who told you this?
I'm not hungry.
You've got to eat something Agnes.
Of God.
I'm being punished.
Why?
I don't know.
Yes Mother.
We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
Yes, Mother.
It's not that... it's not that...
What do you mean?
It's not my time of month.
For what?
You have a lovely voice.
No I don't.
I just heard you.
That wasn't me.
No I'm not.
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
What would you like to talk about.
I don't know.
Anything... may I sit down?
First thing that comes to your mind?
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Have you ever loved anyone?
Yes.
Who?
Everyone.
Well, who in particular?
Right now?
Uh huh.
Who?
Oh, there are so many.
Oh, yes!
Oh, I know he does.
You've been alone together?
Often?
At least once a week.
Oh, yes.
Where do you meet?
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
Would you like to talk about it?
Why should they?
No. I was sick.
How were you sick?
Something I ate.
Did it hurt?
Yes.
Where?
Down... there.
And what did you do?
I went to my room.
And what happened?
I got sicker.
Where did the baby come from?
The baby they made up.
Is that where they say it came from... ?
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Where'd it come from before that?
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
I... I don't understand.
Agnes, how are babies born?
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
What do you mean?
Anything?
What's your real name?
Martha Louise Livingston.
Are you married?
No.
Would you like to be?
Not at the moment, no.
Do you have any children?
No.
Would you like some?
I can't have them any more.
Why not?
I've stopped menstruating
Why do you smoke?
Does it bother you?
One.
Do you know a Marie?
No... do you?
Why should I?
Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
How did she know that?
Somebody told her.
Who?
I don't know.
Agnes...
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
No.
Do you?
Do you believe she really saw them?
Why not?  Mmm?
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
I could never be a mother.
Why not?
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
A mistake... it was a mistake...
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
I was a mistake.
What the child?
Everything... I don't have children.
I'm not sick.
And you're unhappy.
Answer me!  You never answer me.
What did you do?
I'm always bad.
No...
You can tell me.
I can't.
She's dead isn't she?
She can't hurt you any more.
She can.
How?
She...
Yes?
... makes me...
She tells you you're ugly?
Yes.
And that you're stupid?
Yes.
That you're a mistake?
Oh, yes.
And then...
No I'm not.
Are you pretty?
Yes.
Agnes, you're stupid.
No I'm not.
Are you intelligent?
Yes I am.
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.
I really love you.
As much as Mother Miriam does?
Yes.
Who am I?
Doctor Livingston.
And why am I here?
I'm frightened.
Of what?
How did you have a baby?
It came out of me.
Why?
Because I was afraid.
Why were you afraid?
Because I wasn't worthy.
To be a mother?
Yes.
Did anyone else know about the baby?
I can't tell you that.
Will she be angry?
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
And then what happened?
We went to chapel for vespers.
What is it?
Someone's following me.
Who?
What else?
A wastepaper basket.
What do you think it's there for?
For me to get sick in.
Are you ill?
What do you feel?
What do you do?
Which one?
I don't know which one 
Go away, I don't want you here.
Is someone in the room with you?
She said Michael.
Yes.
Who?
How did she know about him?
She'd seen him too.
So she sent you?
Are you frightened?
Not your fault...
Agnes who did you see?
I hate him...
Of course you do. Who was it?
I hate him.
God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
It was alive wasn't it?
What did you do?
I put her to sleep.
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
???
What?
Eve, she strangled a baby!
Marty, what are you doing here?
Something they... that they overlooked.
I don't know.
What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
All I want is one more week.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
I'll have a decision by next week.
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
You have proof?
When?
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
It's your favourite...
Who are you?
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
Who are you?
Oh that one there, in the corner.
Yes.
Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
Who told you this?
Do you still go to church?
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
You can call me Sister.
You were a smoker?
Two packs a day.
I can beat that.
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
Is that normal?
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
Who was the father?
I haven't a clue.
What man had access to her?
None as far as I know.
Was there a priest?
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
Could there have been anyone else?
And you didn't try to find out who?
What's your opinion?
I believe Agnes is different.
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
So, someone else could have done it.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
It's possible isn't it?
That's absurd!
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
Shortly after she came to us.
And you weren't shocked?
And what happened?
This was before her pregnancy?
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
You hate us don't you?
What?
Nuns... you hate nuns.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
Then help her.
There's another choice.
What?
Aquittal.
When would Agnes have conceived the child?
Oh, some time in January.
Yes.
There's nothing here.
Was the child full term?
Oh, Dear God...
What is it?
The sheets...
You lied to me
About what?
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
Yes.
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
Do you know what she did to her?
I don't think I care to know.
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
Because I didn't know... 
And my permission?
We'll see about that.
Don't deny it!
I haven't decided yet.
The woman's health is at stake.
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
Bullshit!
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
Would you like one?  Huh?
I'm out of prac...  ... practice. 
All right?
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Hand rolled.
Even Christ would partake socially.
Saint Peter?
Pipe!
Right...
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
Yes I do.
Do you want to become one?
Become?  One is born a saint.
Listen to her singing.
I'd like to begin.
Begin what?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
May I be present?
Of course.
Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
For the Church?
For Agnes.
The father!
Who is he?
Why must he be anybody?
My God, you're as crazy as...
How  ?
Don't be ridiculous.
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
I'm concerned about her health.
This is permission to take her apart.
Where is she?
I have a few more questions to ask her.
Who knew she was pregnant?
Why do you insist upon pressing...
Was it you?
Is it because she's a nun?
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
For what?  An abortion?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Too late for what?
The baby?
She didn't want any help.
Before or after you killed the child?
I left it with her and I went for help.
That's enough.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
She can't remember.
Oh, don't do this!
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
Lay them down.
Eh?
Lay them down.
They're yours.
They are?
Bet you're only eight and a half.
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
I bet you're  -- sixteen!
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
Are you now?
Yeah, I've blown school out.
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
Oh, it's all right.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Why aren't you at work?
I'm a deserter, too.
What about all these letters?
Yeah.
The police station.
You don't think...
Leave them drums alone.
Spoil sport!
Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
Ever seen one of these before?
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
I see you go to the night court.
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
Me? Why?
I don't snore.
You do - repeatedly.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
Of course I can.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
Grotty?
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
Get him out of here!!
That's not your Grandfather.
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
A butcher?
Gerron.
Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
Sure. .
What's up?
Ringo!
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
We do.
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
Well ... come on.
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
Should I say it?
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
What are we waiting for?
Morning!  Who's that little old man?
It's Paul's grandfather.
No, I didn't you did ...
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
Go away! You've spoilt it.
Are you supposed to be here?
I've got you worried, haven't I?
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
How'd you guess?
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Is it ... is it, really?
Are you pulling my leg?
Something like that.
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
Aye, I knew you were.
The big hammer?
But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
But that's not like a real person at all.
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
Yes.
See you.
Books are good!
Parading's better!
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
A book!
You're only right.
Where are you off to?
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
Oh, they seem all right to me.
What are you doing?
Lip reading.
What are they saying?
Would you two like a cup of tea?
Hello, Grandfather!
Hello.
And we're looking after him, are we?
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Why do you always use your left hand?
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
No, that's his other one.
Clean though, isn't he?
Is that yours?
What are you doing there?
What little old man?
That little old man.
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
Give 'em a pull.
Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
Behave...
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
What's old got to do with it?
You needn't bother.
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
No.
Now get on with it.
We were going to do it.
Let's have you.
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
You wouldn't!
They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.
Hi Norm!
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
Tonight? We can't make it ...
Hello.
No, not me.
Oh you are, I know you are.
No, I'm not.
You are.
I'm not, no.
My eyes are lighter.
Oh yes.
And my nose...
Aye, but you know him well.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
That's what you tell me.
What have you heard?
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
You're a window rattler, son.
It'll only get you into trouble.
He's betrayed the class.
Oh, leave off!!!
Temper! Temper!
That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
Well!
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
Don't exaggerate.
I've got the stuff. Come here.
Where's my grandfather?
None for me, then?
What do you think are you're up to?
Look after him.
Do I have to raise me voice?
It's not my fault.
Well, you stick to that story, son.
I'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller than you.
Who?
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Down the ... er ...
Oh, down the ... er ...?
Yeah, down the ... er ...
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
But John hasn't got any.
What?
How's that?
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
Eh, what's all this?
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
I'll set John on you!
Oh, a little savage, is he?
So you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.
Oh... God... am I cold...
I feel like shit...
Locked.
Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
... I don't know...
Where's Irth?
I don't recognize that constellation.
I got it.  Oh boy.
Can you get it a little closer?
Any rotation?
Yeah.  Two hours.
Is it solid?
It's... basalt.  Rock.
Close enough to walk to!
I'll go first.
Just machinery.
What is it?
Maybe we can get in by the top.
You want to try?
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
How do you feel, Dell?
Wretched.  What happened to me?
Breathe deeply.
Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
A transmission?
I have recorded the transmission.
Computer, what language was that?
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
How long to fix?
Hard to say.
Well, get started.
Hello, Faust!
<u>He</u> died.
Okay.
What happened to the lights?
What happened?  Where's Sandy?
Dead.
What the hell's going on?
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
Oh -- God -- oh --
Oh, no.  Oh, no.
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
And when will you be ready to do that?
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
It's really on there tight.
Hey, guess what?
What?
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
Right. 
Where did it come from?
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
God, that smoke's poisonous!
But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
It's over, Hunter.
Hey now, what is this?
There.  Should be coming through about there.
I'll do it.  The rest of you continue.
How's Broussard?
He's running a fever.
Still unconscious?
Sounds like a rough one.
We've got six hours left.
Oh my God.
<u>How</u>?
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.
Now what's wrong?
I've completely lost their signal.
Can you get them back?
No.
What do you mean, no?
How many?
I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.
Look at that.
What's happening up here?
This is horrible.
What common objects?
Don't count on it.
We can use the flamethrower.
Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?
That way.
What's wrong?
It's close, real close.
Air lock?
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
No, it's coming.
<u>What is it</u>?
It won't come -- it's stuck.
It's stopped?
No, thank God... just missed him.
Is it still dripping?
We're going home.  We're in hyperspace.
The commander normally has first publication rights.
We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
Are they close?
They're on the next level up.
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
That tube must be depositing it in him.
We do know that.
Where are we?
Oh my God.
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
What the hell happened?
10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Good!  Moisture content?
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Any microorganisms?
Not a one.  It's dead.
Anything else?
Okay, Chaz, I hear you.  I've got you on my board.
Martin, uh, we've found it.
But?
Find anything we missed?
Still worried?
This ship is full of cat hair.
Hey, can you guys hear me?
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
Take us up.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
Where are you?
Food-storage room!
What's it doing, having a seizure?
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
Two down, four to go.
What's that supposed to mean?
Can you make out any pattern in all that?
Which presumably means...
All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
Kill me...
That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
I'll get you out of there.
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
What can I do?
Better?
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
It's a rhino.
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?
Let's get back and call this in.
Nice howitzer you've got there.
Minh...
Seal everything now!
What's happening?
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
How many of them are there?
Give or take.
Where is she?
I found it...
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.
Picking up velocity.
It's too late!
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
Has anybody talked to them?
Not yet.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
De Vries?
Something spooking the rhinos?
Hey, Guttierez?
What?
Whoa, wait a minute...
What?
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?
Forget it, man.
Alright, okay.  Look...
What?
But I'm going first...
Careful of that edging there...
Hold it, hold it...
What's wrong?
Wait.  Lost it.
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
It's alright, it's cool...
Is this the suit?
They knocked out the external feeds.
Okay, we're in business.
Okay, I'm out of here!
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
Four.
And before that?
Six month stint on Datus.
Only six?
What is that?
Seltzer?
Yeah.  Somebody won.
I've found Ackland!
Think I spoke too soon...
That's the wrong way!
Hurry it up.
I... I can't!
You have to...
How's it going?
You should hit the sack, too.
What time's sundown?
'Bout five minutes.
Give me a yell is something happens.
How do you know my name?
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
And what is your name?
Phoebe.
Phoebe?
May I come in?
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.
Eddie...
I'm about to go into the shower, I won't be able to hear you...
You take charge.
Hungry?
Just like that, eh?
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
Aren't you?
All paved with diamonds and gold?
You know me better than that.
Paved with what, then?
What time?
You could sleep, too, couldn't you?
Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
We're?
So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the Theater, after all...
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
You have no right to say such things!
... and Karen.
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
What do you take me for?
I never intended you to be.
What have you got to do with it?
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
I can't believe my ears...
You're too short for that gesture. Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.
She was a liar, she was a liar!
Then say so.
I won't play tonight.  I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...
I don't suppose there's a drink left...
You can have one at Max's.
I don't think I'm going.
Why not?
No, it's not.  It's for this.
It's the same thing, isn't it?
That isn't a waiter, my dear. That's a butler.
Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler," can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler...
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
Answer me this. What makes a man become a producer?
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
She was magnificent.
Then you've heard too.
I was there. An eyewitness.
Margo.
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
We have that in common.
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
Miss Caswell got lucky too late. The audition is over.
Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
Eve! My understudy...
Didn't you know?
Of course I knew.
How... how was Miss Caswell?
Frankly, I don't remember.
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
Bill!
Huh?
You've already met.
Where?
Right here. A minute ago.
Good luck, genius...
Nothing?
Only in some ways. You're prettier...
Oh well...  ... look through the wigs, maybe it got caught-
Can't keep his eyes off my legs.
She's quite a girl, that what's-her name...
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
Take care of yourself out there...
Bill...
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
And cut that out right now.
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
Knit me a muffler.
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
Then you're crazy.
A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
Many happy returns of the day...
I get a party, don't I?
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
Yeah... I will.
How is Eve? Okay?
I love you...
Happy little housewife...
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
I thought you were going to be late-
When I'm guest of honor?
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
For instance what?
Thank you.
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
It's all over.
What's all over?
What fire and music?
Who?
The kid. Junior.
I must have frightened her away.
I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
Don't mix your metaphors.
I mix what I like.
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
I will not calm down!
Don't calm down.
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
It's obvious you're not a woman.
Well, I am.
I'll say.
Margo, let's make peace.
Then what would be enough?  If we were married?
Bill...  ... where are you going? To find Eve?
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
It's only for the license. There's a three-day wait - blood tests, things like that...
I understand she is now the understudy in there.
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
Never try to outguess Margo.
Groom.
A cowboy.
A married lady.
Hello, what's your name?
Why?
I just wondered.
Just wondered what?
Why.
Why you have to go out there.
I don't have to. I want to.
Is it the money?
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
It's only one picture deal.
I read George Jean Nathan every week.
Also Addison deWitt.
Thanks for your help... good luck.
Is that what you want me to be?
Don't run away, Bill.
From what would I be running?
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
When I told you what every young actress should know.
- and for you.
You're quite a girl.
Lemme fix you a drink.
What did you expect - live sables?
Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-
It was Fort Sumter they fired on-
You need new girdles.
Buy some.
The same size?
How do you do, my dear.
I'm sure you must have things to do in the bathroom, Birdie dear.
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
Kill the people.  Got your key?
Adorable. We now got everything a dressing room needs except a basketball hoop.
Behind in your dues? How much?
Birdie-
You don't like Eve, do you?
An answer.
Why not?
Now you want an argument.
She works hard.
Night an' day.
She's loyal and efficient-
Like an agent with one client.
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.
Late for what?
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
Who are you?
Miss Harrington...
What are you doing here?
You were just looking around...
What for?
You probably won't believe me.
Probably not.
It was for my report.
Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.
The maid'll fix it in the morning.
Subway.
How long does it take?
It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.
That's the door.
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
Oh, no...
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
I thought you'd forgotten about me.
Hello, Miss Channing.
If I only knew how...
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
Good night, Eve. I hope I see you again soon-
Not just that way. As a friend...
Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.
Mrs. Richards.
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
I think she would cheer.
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
Of course.
You won't forget it?
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
May I have your coat?
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
We're having lunch with a movie talent scout.
They certainly don't waste much time.
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
I don't intend to be.
There can't be very much-
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
Eve... don't cry.
But the raves about your performance-
He's not my friend. You were my friends...
I think I know...
If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
Addison wants me to play it.
Congratulations, Eve.
Hello, Miss Harrington.
No, thank you.  Yes. I've seen every performance.
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
The curtains. I made them myself.
While you're cleaning up, I'll take this to the wardrobe mistress-
Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
If you'd like.
The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
Good evening, Mr. deWitt.
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
You've what?
She's just outside the door.
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
How much time have we?
How far to the station?
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical-
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
Do you want it on?
It doesn't matter.
Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
What about Bill?
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
Not to you. Not to Bill.
With tears?
I remember.
How was the concert?
Coming?
Eve.
I'm beginning to catch up.
You've got to admit it would be a novelty.
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
Well of all-
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
- well? What happened?
What's so funny?
Who is it? What's it all about?
Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?
I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
How's the new one coming?
The play? All right, I guess...
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
How do you mean?
Don't be evasive.
Margo, you haven't got any age.
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
You'd have been proud of her.
I'm sure.
She was a revelation...
To you, too?
You've been talking to that venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt-
Karen and I just don't want an accident-
I have no intention of having an accident!
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.
You know, she probably means well, after all...
That depends.
I mean really, deeply angry...
I don't think I could be.
Call, what call?
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
I placed...?
"Liebestraum."
I just played it.
Play it again.
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
Margo. You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...
When's the audition?
Anything to help you out, Max.
All you got to do is name it.
Promise.
I promise.
Are you breaking the contract?
I didn't hear you.
I said I'm a dying man!
What the hell were you doing rewriting my story--
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
--it was fine the way it was--
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
--mine's better--
--no way--
What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
Carl?
Yeah?
It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
All right, what do we know?
--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
Hey?
--what do you think?--
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
What's that?
Goddamnit--
--see?--
--I'm trying--
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
I don't get it... this really was my turf...
This is terrific work, if you like rejection.
Facts or theory?
I hate both parties.
Republican?
Sure.
Who'd you vote for?
When?
'68.
Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
--we will--
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
You want me to be the bastard.
--The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin--
Goddamnit--
--shit--
--we gotta top the Times--
--shit, who do we know?--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
He'll give us a sworn statement.
I think that's him.
Who?
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
Woodward?
You overslept?
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
--what time is it?
Night.
I'll never get out of here in time.
Hi, it's me. I'm still here.
I'm so glad.
Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?
Donald Segretti?
You can't.
I know where Dwight works.
Do you feel much about the things you did?
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
I didn't.
Chapin did contact you then?
Sure--off the record.
Absolutely--
I think.
Give me your checkbook then.
I thought you had to get to Miami.
There's always a later plane.
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
You've really got to go.
So tell me about the Times article.
What do you want to know?
And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
--then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
But they both worked at the White House?
I will not talk about the other two.
I really can't talk now--
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
Just tell me his title.
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
We can't talk inside either?
--I'm not here.
Look, I told you inside--
What I don't understand is how you got here.
They are not my clients.
Are you implying you don't believe me?
I have nothing more to say.
You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
Where?  What do you mean, where?
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
...you're definitely doing a story...?
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
Who?--be specific. How high up?
There were more then.
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
Your name, please.
James McCord.
Security consultant.
Where?
Government. Recently retired.
Where in government?
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
Where?
I think so.
I couldn't say.
But it's possible.
I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
What'd you get on W.House?
--who you got?--
Anyone but Bernstein.
Howard--
--remember Toronto, Harry.
--has any of them got an ax?--
--no--
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
--which Young?
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
A boy or a girl?
The what to what?
You work there, Miss Abbott.
Sorry.
No, it was good.
Good work, Ostreicher.
Thanks coach.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
Great evening, isn't it?
What did you just say?
Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for letting us have a great party.
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
All right, I got some scotch.
So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
This is your plan, Finch?
This.  Right now.
Of course, Finch.  What?
What are we gonna hear?
What do you suppose they're saying?
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Just go!
Why is this?
You're gonna shit your pants!
Not bad, Chris.
Um...Chris --
You can call me Oz.
You can call me Ostreicher.
What's your middle name?
Forget it.
Nice car.
I'm glad you think so.
I wasn't making fun of you.
Why are you doing this?
How did you know I was here?
Stifler told me.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
Uh...my dad's the manager.
What?
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
I know.  Salt and pepper?
So we're gonna be close next year?
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
What about the game?!
I'm not playing.
You're missing the game for us?!
Oz, it's okay, I know.
Yeah right.
You mean...and orgasm?
You got it, stud.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
No you haven't.
Do you?
Of course.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Did you guys hook up or something?
Are you kidding?  No.
Don't you love my sexy body?!
You're so big!
Fuck me!  Yes!
And you said...
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
There's our man.
You can crash at Stifler's?
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
Gotta go.
Ow, what the hell?
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
Right.  That gives us...
I have no idea.  Finch showers in a bathing suit.
Hey, where's Finch?
Please, God.  Let this be it.
Holy shit.
How do you know that?
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
Back out?  You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid.  You afraid or something?
Yeah, sure.
You're not...busy?
Dad!  I know!
Do you know about the clitoris?
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Son.  This lady's here for you.
What was your name again?
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
Don't you want me to?
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
You guys got the Latin homework?
Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
I still think you're okay.
I'll just say that we had a great night together.
After getting laid?
What's up, fellas?
You've got something going?
Yes.
No...you...go...ahead.
So you need to change, right?
Well...uh...
Shame on you!
You mean like, <u>strip</u> strip?
Uh...
Move with the music.
Jim...
Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
God dammit, Stifler!
Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?
Kevin, this is serious!
Let me know.
Vicky, wait.
I think "shithead" really says it.
Oh...ungghhhhh!
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
I think you're so right, Kevin.
You want to do it?
Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
See -- this is the nicest room.
You comfortable?
Yeah, are you?
You sure you're comfortable?
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Yeah.
Me too.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
I don't know.  How do you?
Victoria...I love you.
That was a great night.
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
You called me to ask me how to get laid?
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
Does it tell me how to get laid?
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
Qualify for what?
You ever hear of something called The Bible?
Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
Feeling better, Oz?
I'm such a loser.
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
So does your tongue cramp up?
What reputation?
...Guess what?
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
NOVA!!
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
Keep it down, dude.
You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
Our last game is this Saturday.
Here, babe.
Really?
Merde! Just missed!
Just like sex with my wife.
The key is don't look down.
Also like sex with my wife.
Either way works for us...
God. How can you eat like that?
Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.
Who gives a shit? I've had it up to here with arrogant Frenchmen.
Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
Sure. I can follow that.
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
Salots! Shitfucker!
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting.
Andy! Holy shit!
What about your glasses?
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
Hello?
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
I know. He told me.
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
Holy mother of God...
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
We don't both have to die.
I know where he'll go.
Didn't even have to ask.
God. I can't believe it.
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
Well, they are French.
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
Okay. Be careful.
Oh God. Shit...
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
You on drugs? Huh?
Pull over! Now!
In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Enculé d'Americain.
Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
Or else what? You'll kill me?
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
Do you think I'm an idiot?
Another step and he's dead!
Ha. Some wonder drug...
You recognize her?
We know you were with her.
He was a good man. Now his wife is a widow.
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
Andy...
It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.
Andy? Andy is that you?
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
Alright. Let me write a letter.
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -
Now!
Merde.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
Why were you so late tonight
I was showing Sonya something . . .
What were you showing her?
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
Hurry, Grandmama!
Are you running away?
Where is your home, Anya?
I have to go now, before it gets light.
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
Is everyone all right?
Did I tell you that?
No! I look ridiculous!
Come out! I can do alterations.
You'll laugh.
I shant!
Yes, your highness.
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
Ouch!  That really hurt!
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
Why do you want to go to Paris?
By pulling my hair?!
Come on up!
Just what do you think you're doing?!
Forged papers! Now, what?!
Come on!
You must enjoy causing me pain!
It's the best fork of all
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
Oh! I'm sorry...
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
Dmitri?
Don't let me go!
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
Dmitri didn't want the money?
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
And this is my future. This is who I am!
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
Trust me, it's her!
Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
I'm getting a chest cold..
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
He's her?
She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
What do we do now?
See? The Princess is under there ...
How is our current financial status?
The "Odessa Dunk"?
But it's not	the money, Vlad.
I'll show you!
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
You are the boy ...
Promise me she'll have her home.
She does.
And tell me that she's happy.
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
I had nothing to do with it!
You gave the orders!
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
Fellas... you know-Jesus! Come on!
This guy's on television! Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?
This guy's on television.
Can I have your autograph?
Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
Hey!
What?
Who's on television?
Singer!
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
It's an important issue.
Who are you?
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
What do you mean, next?
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
Allison.
Well, why not?
Yeah, Earl Warren?
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
I missed my therapy. I overslept.
How can you possibly oversleep?
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
That movie makes me feel guilty.
Alvy, I...
What-what-what-what's the matter?
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
Don't give it to me. Don't!
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
Well, no... not just, not only.
Hi. Hi, hi.
Uh... you-you wanna lift?
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
Me? Oh, downtown!
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
Oh - you're an actress.
No, Chippewa Falls.
Right!  Where?
Wisconsin.
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
For yuh.
All right.
I'll getcha a piece.
Oh, right.
Nice car.
Don't be funny.
You want your tennis stuff?
Huh? Oh... yeah.
Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...
Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall?
Yeah, I know.
Well...
Well... thank you again.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You sure?
No, I got time.
Oh, you see an analyst?
Sylvia Plath.
Oh, yeah.
Neat?
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.
No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
Fifteen years, huh?
Fifteen years, yeah.
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
No, so help me.
I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
Yeah!
Yeah?
Hey, listen, listen.
What?
Gimme a kiss.
Oh, all right.
Okay.
Okay?
We can digest our-
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
As Balzac said...
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
Good? I was-
Hey?
Yeah?
big subject with me, yeah.
M'hm.
Those are the two categories...
Look, look at that guy.
Look at these guys.
You see, like you and I...
You- Do you love me?
Do I love you?
That's the key question.
Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
Don't you think I do?
Of course.
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
Yeah, I know it's small.
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
Really?
I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Are yuh?
You followed me. I can't believe it!
I didn't follow you!
Well, what is your definition of following?
Following is different. I was spying.
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
David? You call your teacher David?
M'hm.
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
Sinatra?
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
Will it change your wife?
Will it change my life?
Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
David! David! I can't believe this!
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
I'm following you and David, if you-
What's- It's me, open up.
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Yeah, where is the spider?
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
snow shovel or anything or something.
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
Oh, Jesus, really?
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.
-me, my God, it's a great day!
Yeah, but it's real close.
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
Here's a real present.
Remember, we had that thing.
Thing?
yes, we had, uh...
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
Christ!
Yeah, this place is great.
Oh, good. Okay.
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
God.
Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
Oh!
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
This is my room.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
What'd I do?
Step up here!
What'd I do?
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
Why are you so hostile?
Oh, I'm sorry!
Don't get upset!
I can't.
What-
My head is throbbing.
Oh, you got a headache!
I have a headache.
Bad?
Oswald and ghosts.
Man, that's great. That's just great.
You have a raccoon?
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience.
Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
Key word here is "indulgent."
without getting... well, let's put it this way...
Oh, do yuh?
Oh.
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
Sixteen years ago.
Whatta you mean?
Ah, Max, you, uh...
Right, Max. California, Max.
Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
Yeah, watch the road!
Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
Max, I've got a hit series.
We do the show live in front of an audience.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
Well, sit down.
Oh, Jesus.
You all right?
I don't know, I mean, I-
You like this house, Max?
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
The one with the V.P.L.
V.P.L.?
M'hm.
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
Max, are we driving through plutonium?
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
His wife has diabetes!
You fired the cleaning woman?
She was stealing.
But she's colored.
She was going through my pocketbook!
They're persecuted enough!
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
Oh, you remember her, Annie.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
You think so? Do you really?
Oh.
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
Oh. What about?
Oh.
It was a wonderful set.
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
There's a whole wing in this house.
Yeah.
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
I was a great beauty.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
I was very charming.
There were many men interested in you?
Oh yes.
Did you know the contractor?
Very well.
Was it a contractor?
It's the way they do things.
Did you see permits?  Did he have a license?
A triumph.  When did you get here?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
You're not upset that I brought the dog?
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
Absolutely.
Had a little help?
Absolutely not.
It has your ring.
It's going.  It's going.
Isn't Skye amazing?
She's got great tits.
She's a constant surprise.
No, what?
Leo?
I have a small window of time.
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
She already has.
Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth.
Things always look much worse in the morning.
What what's about?
Why didn't you bring him?
What?
Why didn't you bring him?
Oh.
To dander.  Otis.
Oh.
Didn't I say?
Borrow whatever you like.
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
Just don't fucking tell her.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Don't you miss it?
Never.
You should have brought him.
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
Let's get the kids.
Would you leave us alone right now?
He's gonna miss his flight.
Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
And you're not the wife.
It's not a contest.
Take good care of it.
That for us?
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
Can I open it?
Just did.  Jealous?
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
So?
What is it?
The suspense is killing me.
Harry called.
And?
Lucy overdosed.
But she's alright.
Stupid tart.
She left a note.
You need to call your dad.
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
And you know our friends, how?
We live next door.
Oh.  You're them.
Excuse me?
We've heard lots about you.
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
Cal, my wife Judy.
Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys. Hey!!
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
There's a test, you know.
You're crazy baby.  I love you.
Oh yeah...
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
Oh yeah?
Let me heal you, baby.
I call that a perfect day.
Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
Hm.  We should do it again.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
Not as a rule.
Go.
Hey!  Would you?
It was fifteen seconds.
I don't think so.
He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room?
I'm fine, babe.
Give him a minute, Clair.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
Anytime, sport.
We closed.
You only made half your quote this year.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
Not millions.
There's still time to undo this.
We'll be fine.
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
Whatever you say.
You're out of your mind.
Take your time, Jer.
Ryan's novel.
Hardly...
Kiss the back of my knees.
No.  Did you?
I mean, you're really back.
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
I'm going to throw up.
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.
In the kitchen.
Two minutes.
Okay, knock it off.
Truce?
Truce.
Dinner.  Don't be angry.
She left the fucking gate open.
He'll find his way back.
Fuck you.
Otis!!!!
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
And how hard it hit?
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
It's a novel.
What are you saying?
Cal, too?
Sally, for Christ's sake.
Anyone else?
This is insanity.  Sally...
Don't.
Don't push me away.
You changed your mind.
What?!  You aborted our child?!
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
Yes.
I don't want to go tonight.
No.
Me too.
That's under lock and key.
Happy anniversary.
It's a Calder.
I know.
I know.
Panes!  How are you?
Oh, you know, I am.
What's a sign for that?
Coffee?
Sure.
We have a gift?
Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
It's a novel.
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
Not long.
Don't be silly.
Ours.
You lose this?
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
Well, you know...good days, bad days.
I meant Sally.
I meant Sally.
You're an interior decorator, right?
I'm a little nervous, so...
A little out of my element.
And you know, he really does not.
Scout's honor.
I need to leave you now.
I will treasure this.
Lemon or raspberry?
Lemon.
Ryan's really angry with me.
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
That's a lot of those.
Medallions.
A lot of cakes.
Yes.
How long have you been married?
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
You must have been a baby.
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
That's very nice.
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
I think there are sixteen there.
Of course it's alright.
What?
I didn't say a word.
Jesus Christ.
How's he doing?
Ryan.
Well, yes, actually.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!
Don't go in, Ryan.
What?
Sally?
We could hardly say no.
Hors d'oeuvres or something?
I so wish I'd known.
Well, whoever did this is amazing.
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
I'm so sorry.
I...
Is there space here?
Yes.
Do you need anything else?
I was impressed.
Oh?
The charades.
Thank you.
That was my clue.
Oh?
The Shostakovich.
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
Yeah.
If he were still alive, maybe.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
Good, you brought your violin.  I want you to play.
Are you lovesick?
Will champagne help?
Panes is here!
She's even better looking in the flesh.
You don't know she's a bitch.
She's all over him, are you blind?
It could be worse.
Fuck you, Panes.
Like your business managers?
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Like the last time.
I wasn't finished.
It's our anniversary, Panes.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
We're just feeling our way back.
"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
What does that mean?
So how are you really doing, Panes?
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
I'm worried about your Galiano.
You're a shit.
Yes.  Fine.
That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
No.  Not something new.
Um.  Happy for you.
You're my best friend.
That's not an answer, is it?
Thank you, Panes.
You don't need to thank me.
You're keeping a record, are you?
Monica and Ryan.
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.
You don't need to do that.
He's a novelist.
Ah.
Like Joe.
I hope they're watercolors!
Isn't this a fabulous picture?
Yes.
She's such a great photographer.
So where should I put it?
I thought it was okay where it was.
It's much more personal in here.
A notch above the storage room.
Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.
I trust you.
Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
You weren't exactly horrified.
I don't have a drug problem.
We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
Why are you doing this?
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
Invisible!
Someone who follows his heart!
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
Are you sure this is a real dance?
You're right!
Wait!  When can I see you again?
And you are...?
No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
You dance...
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
What <u>was</u> that thing?
Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
Worker!  Come back here now!
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
Want a list?
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
And only you can become a Queen?
Well...no, but --
So what makes you so special?
We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'
Yes?
Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
Why do they have you tied up here?
The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different.
There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
I'm the Princess, aren't I?
And do Princesses do improper things?
Who is that idiot?
Bala!
I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork?
BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!
Z!  Over here!
I wonder...what...was it all...for...
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Oh, no, sir!
So tell me.  Where's Z?
I...I have no idea, sir.
That's correct, sir!
Not that one.  Or that one.
Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
May I cut in?
What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
All these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>.
Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
Ask me why we're so successful.
Why are we so successful?
We declared war again?  Are you scared?
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
Hey, did you hear what he said?!
I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
I can't think of any.
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
Wear this.
You're a real buddy.
Yeah, I know.
My mother.
This the place?
You sure this is a good idea? DOBISCH Can't think of a better one.
I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
Not there.  Under the mat.
So this is your mother's apartment?
Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?
Care to make a small wager?
Shall we say -- a dollar?
Morning, Mr. Baxter.
Say, you got a lulu.
Yeah.  I better not get too close.
You should have stayed in bed this morning.
Good night.
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
No.
You mean tonight?
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
I forgive you.
One more?
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
Three.
You all right? What's the matter?
Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
This is a bad day for me.
What is it?
Don't you remember? We were at the office party together --
I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --
Here. How about some breakfast?
No -- I don't want anything.
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
Someone from the office.
And where are you now?
In his apartment.
His apartment?
I mean -- her apartment.
What's your friend's name?
Baxter.
What's her first name?
When are you coming home?
As soon as I can walk.
Something wrong with your legs?
No -- it's my stomach.
Your stomach?
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
I'm not very good at it.
I am. Let me get the cards.
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
I don't want it.
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
Was he really upset when you told him?
I'm sure that's the explanation.
You really think so?
No doubt about it.
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Do I have to?
Sure.
Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?
Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
Who'd care?
There's a call for you --
For me?
Are you all right?
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
Are you supposed to?
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
I guess so.
I know so. He's a taker.
Where?
Here.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
Are we dressing for dinner?
No -- just come as you are.
Shall I light the candles?
I mean, after that?
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
Fine. How's your eye?
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
Oh.
That's very wise.
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Are you sure? How's your knee?
I'm fine all over.
Mind if I come in?
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
Baxter?
I don't know.
The Vice Squad?
I'm not through with you yet.
Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
Relax, Baxter.
Yes, of course.
You know how people talk.
Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
Put me down for Thursday again.
Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
Now I'll have to borrow your key.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
How's that again?
I dig.
Baxter?
How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
No, no -- just had a little accident.
On account of me.
You?
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
Hi, Baxter.
What do you want?
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
I sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, I'm very sorry --
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
Good evening, Baxter.
What's her name?
Hello, Miss Kubelik.
Any of that coffee left?
How do you spell her last name?
Kubelik -- with two k's.
How's the patient?
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
Well, I have things to do --
What's this -- you packing?
You like Castro?  I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?
Who is Mickey?
No.
Family?
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
No.
Not so rough, honey.
Good night.
Good night?
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
Who?
No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
I see.  What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
Doctor.
Dreyfuss.
Tell me again -- what's my name?
Dr. Dreyfuss.
And what happened to you?
I took sleeping pills.
No.
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?
Come on, Fran.
Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
Still afraid somebody may see us together?
How long has it been -- a month?
Six weeks. But who's counting?
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
It's been hell.
How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
Remember what we talked about?
We talked about a lot of things.
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
You're not being funny.
Handle what?
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
You know I do.
I have that date -- remember?
Okay.  I just thought as long as it was paid for --
Stop that, Fran.
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
Where do you live?
I told you -- with my mother.
Where does she live?
A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Go where?
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
Did you have a nice Christmas?
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
See if they'll what?
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
Yeah --
Where are you headed?
What's it matter? Get to the point.
I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
I like all of them --
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
You're out of your skull --
Esprit de corps --
No -- absolutely not --
One for all -- all for one --
Get out --
Who the hell are you?
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
How about a drink ?
Winning the war by yourself.
Part.
Which part is that ?
Delta ?
No.
North ?
Yeah. Way north.
What unit were you with ?
None.
Rangers, eh?
Were you Longe Range Recon --
That's quite an array of ribbons...
Let's talk about you.
Tracks ?
Yeah.
We do.
How long were you up there ?
A long time.
Chef.
Yes, sir --
Why they call you that?
Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
What are you doing out here?
Cook school -- that did it.
What do you see?
Probably is.
Whatdoya think it thinks.
That's a light down there --
Charlie?
Looks that way.
Who's he?
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
Can I go get those mangos now?
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.
Smoke !
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em.
We could go in tomorrow at dawn -- there's always off-shore wind in the morning.
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge.
What're you trying to say, Captain --
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
What the hell is it?
They're not Cong.
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.
When'd you do it?
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
Signs?
Listen.
What is it?
Which way? Right or left?
Anybody see some smoke ?
Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
I only met Kurtz once.
Would he remember you ?
You didn't like him.
Our Recon flight ?
Ours.
Terminate ?
Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?
Spooky.
What -- happened here.
How did they know?
Yeah.
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
No, sir.
This gentleman or myself ?
I thought he was a lame.
Well, he's killing now.
A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.
Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.
What's your name, sailor ?
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
Where've you been riding, Lance?
Good swell.
You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?
They far enough?
The wind --
Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !
Boss left.
How big it is?
Change.
It's still pretty hairy, sir.
Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels Four -- bring it in on along tree line and huts.
Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees.
I got bored in Saigon.
Haiphong.
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
No. Walked.
What'd you do for supplies?
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
When did you hear?
I met him.
You'll find enough Cong up there.
Fucking savages.
Who?
I'm waiting for the fucking boat, Colonel.
It's gonna blow this place out. It's gonna ruin it ...
Why did you come to ... my province.
We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
Do you know me?
Do you?
Yeah, I like it...
You can't have water after morphine.
How's the pain?
How's yours?
Gimme water.
I think think a lie stinks.
Go away -- hide yourself.
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
I had immense plans.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Yes...
Did you know him very well?
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
Maybe he'll get tubed.
Are you finished surfing?
No -- no, Captain.
This one , Lance?
When?
You think?
The other one --
Captain Willard?
Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.
This boat's a mess.
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
Who are you?
May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
I should be checking on the boat.
What's a big question?
Yes.
I know.
Are you warm, Captain?
What if I say no.
Right now -- I am.
Well who the hell verifies that ?
This -- Bob Hope or the like --
That's 27, sir.
You came right to it, son of a bitch --
Where's your chief supply officer?
Beverly Hills --
23   CONTINUED:
102  CONTINUED:
Avalanche season is coming.
184  CONTINUED:
212  CONTINUED:
A certain sonofabitch bastard -more-
Had?
She's dead.
You should know something.
What happened here?
Where'd you say Eric is?
Stay here.
I call it 'the Turtle,' as in carrying your home on your back.
I'll go into town with you.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
That's not what I meant.
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
Let's go.
Be careful, okay?
What's going on?
I'll tell you everything later.
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
Had no choice...  ...Given the situation.
Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
You got two counts against you -- trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
Desmond.
New to the country, kid?
A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --
Does he have people?
I'm not gonna carry you out of here.
We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
Have to backtrack, find another way down.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
There's a cabin, maybe twenty miles south of here.
Told you I'm fine!
How many do you see?
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
You don't feel cold?
Stay still.
You got one?
It was blown up with the plane.
I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
Don't bet on it.
I already have.
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
You broke the radio, remember?
Shut up!
Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
You wouldn't shoot anyone...
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
I need to rent a cabin.
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
Alleged killer.
Bet you're right.  But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
What'd you say they call these spaceships?
Hey, Sam, look over there.  Black and white smoke.
I'm too old for this shit.
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
Get the fuck out of here.
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
Thought that door was open last night...
You hear me?  Ben?
Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
...Ben never sent a signal.
Meaning he'll need a plane.
There's what they're waiting on!
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
You're not still writing that thank-you note?
What is it you want? What?
Call me as soon as you're settled.
I'm sorry.
Don't be silly. How bad?
Hi...  Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
He's good...  And I'm an expert on doctors.
Do you love me?
Emergency room only.
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
I'm starving.
I know. He's just the best.
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
His name?
So what are you doing with a dog?
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
You're not worried that someone might take him?
How old are you?
What about your mother?
How do you know about my mother?
Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
Uh, Udall?
Carol the waitress?
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
I'm not kidding.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
Nice of you... thank you.
The stiff one eye?
Two days.
I can't. I work.
My son.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
What's that got to do with it?
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Hello?
Are you still coming?
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
I was going to do that for you.
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
Thanks, Melvin.
Hey -- you let him...
Fries.
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
Never.
Sex with Simon?
I'll never forget you said it.
I don't.
I'll take a bus.
Hello.
Yeah... Well...
How you doing?
I can trust my brain.
Okay to say something now?
Go ahead.
I should've danced with you.
Okay. Good-bye.
What do you want, Melvin?
What job?
Were you asleep?
I wasn't asleep!!
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
Yes. I really would.
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
Uh-huh...
Why? What have you been thinking about?
Good night.
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
Stop staring. Do a vase.
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
But what about...
One night with me!
I love you...  Let him take you home.
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
I'm not saying nothing to you.
How's Verdell doing?
It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
Hey -- you called me... I...
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
Good evening.
Actually, I don't think so.
No. Please, don't force him.
Just move on. No one here killed him.
Oh, is he dead?
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
Yeeeess!!!
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
Did you... do something to him?
That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.
It smells like shit in here?
Go away.
Please, just leave.
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
I carry bacon in my pocket.
Oh, my gosh.
Now we'll both call him.
Come on, sweetheart...
Would you leave now, please?
I brought you Chinese soup.
That's very thoughtful.
Another place where?
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
Picking on me won't help.
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
But you know where you're lucky?
What's wrong?
How do you write women so well?
Is there a problem?
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a waiter.
Where?
What?
What restaurant?
Uh, Fontella's
So you're from around here?
What is this?
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
What are you doing?
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
What?  You think I'm running you up?
Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.
No fucking way.
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
Bain.  Michael Bain.
How long have you been freelance?
So what happens now?
We go around once.
Okay.
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
Five million dollars?
Game over, bitch!
I'm on the scent.
Such language in front of a lady.
How in the fuck do you know that?
No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.
Where have you been, Robert?
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.
What?
How did he know?
Who is the mark?
Hello, Robert.
The contract?
I know what happened.
I bet you fucking know!
Is this how it went, Nick?
Um, five.
Get on the expressway.
Nikita?  She helped me find you.
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
I work for the government.
Bullshit.
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
Now what?
Okay.  How did you find me?
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
'Them'?
Until a minute ago.
Who is that other guy?
Another contractor.
So this is something between you and him?
Because he is trying to retire me.
He wants to kill you?
Yes.
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
Yes.
Forget it!
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
Listen -- I don't even know your name.
Rath.  Robert Rath.
Electra.
Just Electra?
Yeah.
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
No.
Why?
With computers.
He was... taken.
I killed him.
How did you get into the business?
The C.I.A.?
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
Why not?
I was just different.
But you knew what they were training you for?
Women?  No... not really.
Because you are a women.
Tell me about the first time.
My first take?
Yes.
Why?
No.  Just the first one.
After that?
They become complicated... messy.
Did it ever bother you?
Did it ever bother James Bond?
You said you didn't trust it.
Several.
Good.
Where is it?
Hey, where are you?
Thinking.
About?
I don't know.
That's where he'll be.
Oh.  What do you think about?
No.
Not even a stalemate?
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
Do you think he's here?
Here?
In Costa Blanca.
What do you think he's doing?
Okay.
You should knock.
Sorry.
How was the beach?
Where did you learn it?
Two way?
Transmits and receives.
They saw you coming a mile away.  If I had known we'd be using --
Okay.  Then what?
Sounds pretty well figured out.
Except --
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
For Nicholai?
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
Ten years ago.
Yes.
Ten years later, here you are again.
Do you have ulcers?
I think I got one today.
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
They're worth less points.
Did you think they were newlyweds?
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
How do you know they're not?
Jesus, if someone had --
No.
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
What are you doing?
What?
That's a ridiculous move.
Why?
Can I ask you something?
I'm sure you will.
Yes.
Are you attracted to me?
Yes.
Why?
Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
Attraction is a complication?
It can be.
It happened to you before?
Yes.
Who was she?
What happened to her?
She was taken.
Is this becoming complicated?
No.
When did it start?
Honestly?
Why?
That doesn't sound normal.
Martin.
Four minutes.
What?
Right.
I'm taking off my mike.
Okay.
Electra --
What?
Was nice.
He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!
Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
Hi.  Did you call --
I prefer it like this.
Would you like a drink?
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
For what?
All the time.
Then, I'll sail alone.
Is that all you want?
Thank you.
It's possible.
Average.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
Can I ask you something?
Go ahead.
Anything.
Why didn't you fade?
You mean quit?
That's correct.
How would you like the funds?
American currency.
This will take some time.
Of course, senor.
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.
What are you having?
A coke, if they have it?
It won't last, believe me. And you, when will you go back to the States?
He_s the closest we've got to an intellectual.
Fresh from the shrink I'd say!
Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
You guys having a go a me or what?
What did the beer cost?
Oh yeah, what's that?
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.
He's not drunk, he's crazy.
Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.
He was an electrician?
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
And put it on expenses?
Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel!
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
Tell them we're working for the University.
No, why?
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
No....The Asylum!
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
Can you do the lock on it?
It must be on the other side of this.
I'd love to get in there.
Don't we have enough already?
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
Need any disks?
Destroy the evidence huh.
Have you ever stolen anything?
No, for the Asylum.
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
It looks new, they might miss one or two.
We're going to need it all.
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
So why didn't we?
Afternoon!
No, not if you've got better things to do.
Like a hand?
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
Red or white?
Have you cleared all the rubble up?
No, not yet.
Get me a couple of beers and a salami.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
My God! What happened?
I fell in love.
And a tram hit you?
No, the boyfriend.
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
She's cool.
A fine specimen for conversion.
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
Shit no, it'll be twice cost.
Does Jahn's thing have a name?
Chris! Tell me some good news.
Tell me some bad news?
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
So I hear.
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
WE gotta think of something.
Now you're using that word.
Did you see anything in the files?
Yeah, Dave Walters.
God, I think I need a holiday.
What about me?
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
You're sure?
Do you know the way?
No, by road?
Yeah, pretty well.
Take this exit.
That one?
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
Doug?
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
So am I.
Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.
Before you go, did you get those bruises here?
Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
I've been around.
Sure. Excellent.
I'd like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here....A weekly thing.
Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
I could pencil you in if you like?
Turned Czech huh?
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?
I don't want to get in trouble.
Let's walk over the bridge, we haven't done that for a while.
Kat, I'm in paradise. I don't ever want to leave.
So, we won't be going to London?
I hope you're going to invite me in?
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
No way Doug, I can't.
Beer please! Do you want another drink?
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
No, I love you, really.
Will it help to get you out?
I don't understand, it's your home?
No, it's not true, you're lying.
Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through here?
Sure, I've done it easily.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
Yep, it's all yours.
Great....How long will it go for?
About forty minutes.
Okay?
It is okay........We will paint the wood black, yes?
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
And take Jiri with you?
What for?
Will this thing take long?
No, it should be over soon.
I thought I'd help out.
I figured you more as a Socialist?
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
A champion of lost causes huh?
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
We_re not all running away
Is it dry?
What would you like, beer?
No, just a coffee.
I'd better get you to a hospital.
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
I had it coming from someone.
Don't you have a girlfriend?
Uh-huh!
Run into Josh?
Yeah, but it was okay.
Better than you.
Hmm, I still owe him.
Where did you steal the car?
This is your doing?
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
And you broke into that room?
That's right.
Why did you break into that particular building?
It was the biggest I could find.
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
I'm not sure it's possible.
I'll need to make a phone call.
Yeah!
Hey Doug, where you been?
No, just a drill.
And a fifty foot extension lead?
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
But I have to finish this....
So, he didn't fire you?
I decided to help out at the Asylum.
Josh!
I don't want to go.
Come on Holly!
That's my bag.
Go to hell!
It's more than what you're worth.
Shall I look after the rest?
Honey what a pleasant surprise, sorry to keep you waiting.
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
Will you come home and forget all about him?
Why are there still such headlines?
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
You are responsible...What has happened?
So, who is in the building?
All the more reason to eliminate him.
So go dance.
With you.
She's coming over here...
She asleep?
Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --
And I have no idea why.
What if they expel you?
Kelly wouldn't do that.
Why not?
'Bout what?
Your father dropped off an extra check.
I don't want his money.
It could help with a new car --
Out with Belinda?
You look nice. I should have dressed.
You're fine like that, Mom.
To see your father?
A late night or an early morning?
Late night.  You?
I could take after Dad, too.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
What are you doing here?
He wants to talk to you.
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.
Hypotheticals --
Don't call him a dipshit.
The address?!
Deranged.
She's like some Puritan.
And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan.
Landon!
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
You.
He goes to my father's church. He could've died --
-- This your idea of small talk?
I don't make small talk --
Were?
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
'I hope your dreams come true.'
'Is it really me?'
I know you don't want help.
Yeah.
Like me.
What the -- ?!
What's with the friggin numbers?
I'm an enemy?
I'll take a chance.
It's private.
I know. Don't say anything.
You think so.
Because I try to be nice to people?
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
The world of the dead?
What is that?
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Looking for intelligent life?
Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
You're really into God, right?
In ten words or less?
My relationship with God is my own.
You have to believe to have faith.
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
He doesn't trust you.
The play's going to be really good.
Oh. Just not at school...
Or anywhere where people might see us.
Belinda's a very jealous person.
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
He okay?
You were great the other night.
I haven't been nice to you.
People can see.
Maybe you inspire me.
All of it.
It's not.
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
I don't want to be just your friend --
So you're talking to me?
What does that mean?!
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
Like fire.
What?
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
Is there a rush?
Your turn.
No.
Before we do this.
Excuse me?
Stand right here.
You're sometimes not sure?
We can measure wind.
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
What do you actually know with religion?
I don't understand...
You make me feel...
Loved?
Assholes. This happen to you?
Come on.
What would you do up here?
When did you build this?
Mars.
You planned this --
Are you trying to seduce me?
Ergo?
Can you locate XXI5639I?
From citizen high to citizen low.
One of your secrets.
You're worried about your college applications.
No.
What are you going to -- ?
Pull over.
Jamie --
I'm so sorry. I'm a coward --
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
Help me live until I die?
Nope.
Anything you want.
Slim Jim? Apple? Yogurt? You like yogurt.
What are you thinking?
I've talked to your father.
You know how to waltz??
How you doing?
How're you doing?
Can I -- go out?
Will you do something for me?
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
The Carter boy. Tell me about him.
I'm supposed to always be alone?
I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.
What's Landon Carter up to?
It was a play.
Boys like him have -- expectations.
I'm asking how much.
No. I want what's best for you.
No you didn't.  But he did change. Just not enough.
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
You're in the play?
Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?
I care for her.
This week.
So talk to us about something.
Like what, sir?
We didn't tell him any different for years --
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
Materially or spiritually?
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
Landon. You go on home.
I'm not tired.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
You know about this stuff?
I helped Jamie with the first one.
I thought she built it herself.
You've been well?
Yes. You?
You're marrying again.
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
I'm no dummy.
Now I can do what I want.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
I'd do that --
I'd work backstage or something?
When do I get time for me?
Where did you get -- ?
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
Thank you.
Yeah.
So what did we just make?
Scalene?
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
What do you want, Biff?
This... is the number one single?
I beg your pardon?
This is 1952....?
Morning Dick.
Marty. What's for breakfast?
Hot tip,  Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
What's N.R.C.?
Fine.
Learn anything?
Oh yeah.
You mean you're going to stay up all night?
Here's your jacket!
It's polyester.
Huh?
Hi, Marty.
What time does school start around here?
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
But he didn't ask me.
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
Uh, hi, Eileen.
Dad, you seen the drill?
Fine..
Learn anything?
Oh yeah.
The sunrise? What for?
Well... yeah...
Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!
What is that? A pencil that writes in ink?
'Bike fine point?'
I don't want to hit you in the stomach!
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
I'm going to be at the dance.
Maybe if I used my left....
You'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?
Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
You have a name?
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
I'm sorry, there's no answer.
Operator, what's today's date?
March 11th.
What year?
What?!
Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
Eight thirty.
AM or PM?
Pro, the sun's out!
Catch you later! 
No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact!
Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!
Marty, that would alter history.
Professor? Professor Brown?
Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!
You answered the door!
An atomic bomb.
Say, where did this guitar come from?
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
Well, it was there.
I know.
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
There's no way of knowing.
What theater was I at?
Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.
What? 
I run this place! 
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
Suzy!
What did you do to your hair?
Hi. where's Cato?
Well, he's gone.
Gone?... Where?
He said not to tell.
What's going on?
Okay.
Catch!
How you doing, Cato?
Where'd you get them antlers?
Yeah, I guess.
That's what he told you, huh?
Okay.
I'll catch up with you.
Yeah.
Does he bite?
You ever held another job before?
I used to throw trash for the City.
You lost that one?
Mmmmm.
You like people?
They're okay.
Well, Kit...
Good luck to you.
Thanks.
Sure is pretty.
What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here.
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
No, you're not either.
Yeah? Why not?
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
Okay.
What's your friend's name?
Jack.
You love him?
Yeah. I can imagine.
You still in school?
Nah, I got me a job.
What?
Can I be honest?
He'll say that?
Nothing.
Hi.
Well, stop the world.
Quit my job.
You want to go for a ride?
Well, I got homework.
You're a redhead.
I know.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Why not?
What a nice place.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
Somebody else is going to get it.
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
You know what I think?
But it would hurt.
I came in the front.
How bad off is he?
Are you sure?
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
How you doing?
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
Look at all this junk.
How's he doing?
Think I got 'em?
What'd you put him in there for?
I don't want a steak.
No.
Positive?
I'd like to get out of here.
Everybody loves trout.
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
You smoke Pall Mall?
Have you got a better idea?
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Hi.
This your place?
Hi, whatcha doing?
You're my friend, aren't you?
Yes.
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
You didn't walk out here.
Okay, friend. Start running.
Hi.
Think I'll take the juice?
You tossed my hat out the window.
Wanta sue me?
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
There's another one we owe 'em.
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
I'm starving...somebody, help.
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
Then what?
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
You're a welcome sight...
Apache?
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
Not really.  This is pretty important.
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
Running a little late, Buckaroo.
Let her out. In my custody.
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
Buckaroo--! Sorry--
Dead.  Damnit!
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
What is this thing?  A fighter?
We're going down!  Onto the runway!
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!
Where're you goin'?
And they got Penny!  Look!
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
Raise your hand...where?
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
Go away.  Let me rot?
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
You.  Like the papers all say.
Was she pretty?
The girl I remind you of.
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.
You keep an eye on it.
She was killed, Penny.
How did she die?  I wanna know.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
Believe in Penny Priddy?
Stay here, I'll be back.
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.
What? A black ship?  Where?  A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
Not here!  No Overthruster!
John Whorfin will kill us!
But John Whorfin said kill her.
No, sir.  I think the flint...
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
Pick those up, Reno.
It's a spittin' image.
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.
Why me?
Any sign of Buckaroo?
So where's Buckaroo?
Is, uh... Is he okay?
I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
How about you? Will you be alright?
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
I see.
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
...Who is this?
If you could, I'd 
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
Yes, I'm afraid I have.
Well... THIS.
You wrote his scripts for him?
Before what?
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
Barton!
I want to know!
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
...This'll sometimes help.
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
How d'ya like your room!
...Who is this?
...Who?
I write.
No, I  I didn't mean to sound 
How long you been up there, Fink?
Ever talk to him?
Yeah, he's funny that way.
...No. I never saw him with anyone else.
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
Well that's what he said.
I beg your pardon?
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?
It's still a little early for me.
Ever act?
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started
I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
He's a great writer 
To do what?
...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
...That's fine.
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
...Barton, is everything okay?
Sound a little what?
Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work 
Can be. Not easy, but 
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
What kind of scribbler are you  newspaperman did you say?
...I don't guess this means much to you.
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
Howdy, neighbor.
Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me?  Can't trade my head in for a new one.
My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.
...This must be boring you.
...Yeah, okay.
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
And there's hope for you too, Charlie. Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen policies.
...Your room does that too?
What do you mean?
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
...Can I come in?
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
Are you sure 
Barton. Are you all right?
No... Can I come in?
Why don't we go to your room-
Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out.
...Will you stay with me till they get here?
...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this?  What're we gonna do?
Hold on 
You gotta believe me 
I didn't do this, I did NOT do this
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
We gotta call the police 
Yeah.
But I didn't do it  don't you believe me?
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
But Charlie  why me? Why 
...Where did we put him?
...Yes, thank you.
...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
I  Mr. Lipnik 
Mr. Lipnik, I 
Mr. Lipnik.
Excuse me?
...Okay
Okey-dokey, go ahead.
...Those your only bags?
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
Got a couple questions to ask ya.
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
Also known as Madman Mundt.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
All of which he's now missin'.
Well, some of his throat was there.
Physician, heal thyself.
Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
...I thought you said you were a writer.
Second one of your friends to end up dead.
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
He teach you to do it?
Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr.  Lipnik.
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper.
Where were you tonight?
Home. Watching TV.
All night?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was drinking.
When did you start drinking again?
Take care, you hear?
Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it?
So -- how are things?
It's been three months.
No.
Yes.
Yeah.
What are you doing here?
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
What was she like?
Who?
We were in some of the same classes.
I need a cigarette.
What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?
It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?
No, Nick, please --
Who?
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
Beth.  I didn't mean what I said. About --
I thought you hardly know her.
What do you want, Nick?
She told you, didn't she?
Did you know Noah Goldstein?
I had him in two classes.
You should do something about this lock.
What are you doing here?
I'm De...
How long were you dating him?
How long were you having sex with him?
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
Do you have a cigarette?
I don't smoke.
Yes, you do.
I told you -- I quit.
What's your new book about?
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
How did you feel when he died?
But you didn't hurt --
No.
Because you didn't love him --
Sure.
I passed.
How do you know all this stuff about me?
You know all about me.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
Am I... disturbing you?
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
You tell me.
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
She wiped out her whole family.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
I like you.
Don't get too cocky.
You can make a mistake.
Ice?
What did you pay Nilsen?
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
What if I call you Nicky?
My wife used to call me that.
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?"
Aren't you going to thank me?
Why does he do it?
How's your new book?
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
Did you think it was so special?
What did you think?
How about Roxy?  Is she a fuck to the century, too?
How's your shoulder?
Fine.  How's your back?
Are you kidding?  You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
You shouldn't play this game.
Did you like her to watch?
It's OK.  It's OK.
I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
No.
I don't know.
I found Lisa Henderson.
No.
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
Did you miss me?
I have to do some research tomorrow.
No thanks.
What are you researching?
I'm writing a book.
Really.  What are you writing about.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
It won't sell.
Why not?
Somebody has to die.
Why?
I finished my book.
How did it end?
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
How did he die?
I don't really feel like talking anymore.
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
You have the right to an attorney.
You workin' on another book?
It teaches you to lie.
The answer is no.  I didn't kill him.
What kind of drugs?
What was the weapon?
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
Do you remember his name?
Nilsen?
Was she ever a suspect?
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
What kind of talk?
The usual -- a girlfriend.
I hope I helped you out.
Who was this fuckin' guy?
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
How'd it go, son?
I got tired of being played with.
What is it you got between you?
I don't know.
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.
I went over last night, too.
You... fucked her!  Goddamn dumb sonofabitch... You fucked her! Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch --
I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS!
You don't like punk rockers?
You feeling better?
Why the hell not?
Catherine says you don't like her.
I don't believe it.
Why not?
Catherine told me what was in it.
Where the hell you goin'?
Maybe the maid did it.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
Were you with him last night?
Are you kidding me?
So what do we do -- nothing?
You sure?
What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
She killed him.
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
She's a suspect.
She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
Why do you think he's dead?
Who are you?
Anderson.  Jack W. Donald M.  I'm sorry.  No Lisa.
Did you check all four years?
Yes I did.
No Lisa Anderson, detective.
Can there be some mistake?
No. Should I have?
I'm a painter, too.
Hey  it's the big A.M..
Is this finished yet?
I don't know.
When's your show?
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
Why, so you could humiliate me?
Naa..
Of what?
Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
Saddle River, New York!
New York.
I think it's in New Jersey.
It's in New York.
Ignorant art?
Yeah... Like  stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
Ouch..
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
That was my favorite part!
Who is it?
Annina Nosei.
Is Jean Michel here?
These are great.
Aren't they?
How much for these five?
I'm interested in showing Jean's work.
No.
When?
Tom and Cynthia Kruger.
Jean, your parents are here.
Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
Who did this?  Who did this?
Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.
That's the same guy who did this painting.
I didn't see you.
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
Yes. What do they... stand for?
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
Yes, but as a black painter 
What?
I'm not black.
You're not?
Not what?
Not black.
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
Who said that?
Really?
Paint it out.
It's Andy again.
Still not here.
 In this corner?
You want me to put it here?
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve  I mean Shenge.
Blue? Where?
Hey  Willie Mays.
Who am I?
SAMO.
You're shattering all my myths.
About what?
Your people.
Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!!
We got beat.
You gonna carry that around all night?
I ain't John Henry.
Good.
I don't really have any problems.
I guess it was a long time ago.
Sit down! You're gonna fall out!
I guess you did.
Can I walk you home?
You do! You definitely do.
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
Party girls? Can I call you?
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
Do you know what he's saying?
I'm your family.
Basquiat, don't lie.  This is smack.
You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.
I hadn't thought about it.
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee 
It looks done.
... babies.
You mean babies with you?
What's wrong with me?
Hi.
Hi.
So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.
How is he?
What's that about?
I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
Is that the best quality you have?
Yeah, it's the best one.
I'll take the whole tin.
I really... admire you.
Would you check out my studio some time?
What's your name, man?
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
Hi.
You like your dad's paintings?
Some of them.
See you later.
How can I ever thank you?
Come on.
No, I'd like the scarf.
Have a Mac.
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
So what?
So shut up and keep painting..
What time is it?
That one's for you.
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
I'll make you another one.
A what?
'Phillips head,' right?
OK! Goodbye!
I just don't think you're being fair.
I need this?
It's cold.
It's vichyssoise, sir.
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
I will relay the message.
Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
Where's the fire?
How could you?  I'm a woman...
Hanging on every word.
A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
First you're gonna shut up.  Then you're gonna turn yourself in.
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
We've met.
Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
Didn't I say that?
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
I'm listed.
Pouring myself into my work.
Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
Nope, I told her everything.
"Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
Nor I, on the second.
Y'mean take off our costumes?
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
No.  No glass on the inside.
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
It does to me.
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
Let's consummate our fiendish union!
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
Son!
She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
Ten, nine...
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
... eight, seven...
Silent night, violent night...
What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
No, just give you a splitting headache.
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
And a very, very good one.
It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
You certainly will not.
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
I'm sorry.  I was too late.
Uncle Alfred?
In spirit only, I'm afraid.
He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
I must have dozed off.  My sincerest apologies, sir.
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
But I can't can I?
I am as well as can be expected.
It's good to see you.
Women.
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
I'm on break from-
Sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.
Please be looking for me.
I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.
Youwsa!  Nothing but air.
This is easy.
Crimefighter's rule number two.
I'm afraid to ask.
Pow!  What!  Kazow!
What exactly are you doing?
After you have frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.
Nice suit.  And today you are?
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
Watch the first step.
You think Freeze will take the bait?
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
Umm-hmmmm.
How did you...?
No beauty...
We gotta get those locks changed.
She knows who we are.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
No sign of the snowman.
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
You're not even listening to me.
Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
Who's Ivy?
Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
What happened to his wife?
I need the Wayne Diamonds.
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
I got the diamond.  Quell problemo, Bruce?
Of course.  Alfred still keeps your mother's picture in his room.
He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
Like hell you do.
And she did it all for me.  For love.
She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
Make yourself right at home.
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
How about dangerous curves?
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
I've got to stop him.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
The dreams again, sir?
I think they're getting worse.
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
Scholarly research?
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
No. You said I. I killed them.
Is he all right?
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
He ran away?
He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
The _Rolls_?
Maybe they're right.
Why do I keep doing this?
Perhaps the fall...
What?
...A bat.
Master, Bruce?
All the answers are numbers.
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
What do maniacs always want?
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
How about, MR. E.
Mystery.
And another name for Mystery?
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
How ya doin', Al?
Up here, Al.
Just checking, young sir.
He's home. I sent the signal.
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
We all wear masks.
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
I haven't had much luck with women...
Help Chase. I'll be back.
Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
Mr...?
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
Wait. You can't go.
La'chiem.
Slanta.
Rinka.
I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
What do you know about obsession?
That's usually my line.
Excuse me.
I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.
Like normal folks.
That kid is amazing.
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along?
But...
Well, I met someone...
He sure did.
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
Why do you do that?
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking.
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
I don't want to remember!
I don't-.
...Not the bat?
What are you talking about?
Okay. I'm outta here.
Edward...
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Who is The Batman, Edward?
I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...
I'll show you it works.
...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
_We_ sure are.
I got family. ...Please.
Please. I swear I won't say noth-
Where are you sending Batboy this time?
About what?
Go ahead. You can say it.
A-14.
A hit.
How high up would you say that is?
Which bathroom is that, sir?
Yes?
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
Where's the boy?
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
GET IN THE CAR!!
Look! Police!
I know. I called them.
What about the girl?
Can't we --
How much do you weigh?
...Not even a 'thank you'?
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
How do I know you won't keep them all?
Thank you, Vicki.
... How long have I been out?
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
Better. It's not on the market yet.
It doesn't protect your head, though.
What is that?
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host.  Alexander Knox.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
Do you want a drink?
As far as I know.
What did you see?
There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
Maybe we should just kiss.
All street mimes should be executed.
I know it's late. I -- Are you there?
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."
Keep her on the line!
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
Got it!
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
WHAT?
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
MOVE! Can't you do something??
I missed you, Lieutenant.
I'm on top of it.  If there's a problem --
I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
Let's beat it, man.  I don't like it up here.
What are you, scared of heights?
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta --
Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
I've considered that possibility.
That's it?
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
Man, I feel like Robin Leach.  You actually know all these people?
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
What were you thinking?
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
Not what?
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
HOLY SHIT!!
And what did you say?
Scottish.
There were three strawberries.
Ali?  What's wrong?
Hi,
Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
Sort of half.....
Everything's gonna be fine.
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.
Here, let me do that.
Two dollars please.
Right first time.
Goodnight Annie.
Big day today, huh? 78
Ah, Mr Bean ...
Better go.  Grierson hates people being late.
Ahm.....
oh dear.
Howls he getting on with the family?
And howls Alison?
He's just parking the Governor's car.
He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.
Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that?
No!
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?
Of course.
Maybe two cars.
Welsh.
Honey, calm down now... it's okay...
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
You arrange those flowers yourself?
Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.
She was wearing a helmet.  It could have been worse.
Doctor Jacobson?
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
It is urgent, sir.
Interesting suit.
Nope.
Of course he is.
What's gone?
What?
This sucks.
What a dork. Huh huh.
No it wasn't!
Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't know Anderson had a Camper.
Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
Wait, I wanted her to do it.
Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
Beavis. This is what it's all about.
Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.
Me first!
Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
Me first.
No way butt-hole! I want the window.
Heh heh. We're in Washington!
Damn, huh huh.
So, like, where is she?
Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Uh... Is this the right bus?
Check it out Butt-Head, porta-potties.
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Uh... Huh huh. I have a couple. Butt cheeks, huh huh huh.
Hey Butt-Head, look. A jack. Heh heh.
Heh heh. Fire. Heh heh Aaaaeeehhhhg!!!
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
You hear that, Beavis! We're gonna get alcohol, tobacco and guns!
Uh... bye-bye.
Shut up, dill-hole.
Butt-dumpling...
Turd-burglar...
Dill-wad...
Bunghole...
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
Uh... dill, um, face...
Um... ass... head...
Uh... butt-snatch...
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
Really? I poop too much.
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Uh, we didn't score yet.
Does that say Xanax?
Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
...Two...
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
You see what I see, Bork?
Cavity search...?
Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.
Not on him, Chief.
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
Where are his pants?
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
Whoa, this kicks ass! Huh huh huh.
Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
You scored with two chicks?!
Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I scored with both of them...
No, Jane.
You'll be rich!
Manchurian Tung oil?  Where did you get it?
Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you.
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
Oh no.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
Wave at the lion.
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
How's your arm?
You'd better sit down, hon.
Two hours.
Handbook for the recently diseased.
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
I don't think we survived the crash.
God, it's Jane Butterfield!
What's she doing here?
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
Oh, honey, we may need that.
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
<u>You</u> left me.
That's it?  No number, or instructions?
That little girl saw us.
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
God, this is so corny.  Have we been reduced to this?  Sheets?
Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
Where are your skulls and bones?
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Of course I did.
Here's something.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
What happened?
Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
I guess we open it.
She's only fourteen...
Honey.  Let's go.
The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
Let's see if she can get my model back.
What...?
What time is it?
3:30 I guess.
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
We were trying to scare your mother.
<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
What is going on?
We studied all day yesterday. Don't tell me...
You don't have an appointment, do you?
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
<u>Barbara</u>?!!
Are you available?
All right.  Who are you?
We're...
We're very unhappy.
No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.
No, Lydia, we're dead.
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.
Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
Where'd they go?
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
I want to get in.
You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
Yes.
Three syllables.
I don't know what that signal means.
Beetle!
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?
God, you're anatomically correct!
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
So... You're ready for me now?
You've got to help them.
Can you help <u>me</u>?
W... What is it?

Your qu...?  But you're...
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
Otho'll know what to do.
What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
Just don't tell Lydia.
Why not?
What do you think, honey?
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
Where is your mother?
Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
Dad.  Do you believe me?
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
The attic room is locked --
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
I cannot believe this.
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
What's wrong?
What do you think?
Viridian?
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
You don't have a key?
Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
Are they still here, Otho?
What's happening to them?
Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?
Hellooo!  How's school?
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
They don't want to come down.
Their wedding clothes.
I understand. I've seen it done before.
You were wrong, it did hurt.
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
An attorney?
Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
... And please call me Robert.
... Were you going somewhere?
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
I would like to walk today.
Will you be leaving now, Robert?
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
Yes. I love Eve very much.
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
No more, Robert... No more needles...
Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
... Do you think we should look for him?
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Do you know Raphael?
No sir, I don't believe I do.
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
I hope you're comfortable.
Yes. He's a very careful driver.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
Would you care for a drink?
I would like to watch television.
May I ask your name?
My name is Chance.
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
Did you lose something?
Yes. I lost my remote control.
... Good night, Chauncey.
Chauncey!
Hello, Eve.
Your leg must be getting better.
What is that?
Our greenhouse.
Oh, I like that very much.
Chauncey...
Thank you, Eve.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
That's good. I like to watch, too.
... Good night, Chauncey.
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
I like the President. He is a very nice man.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
I like to watch.
To watch...? To watch me...?
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
Chauncey! Chauncey!
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Yes. It's a very good show.
Yes, very well, thank you.
Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
... Are you sure you like it?
Yes, I do, it's very good.
I don't want Robert.
I see.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
Oh, good.
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
Yes, Eve. That would be good.
Yes. I am very hungry.
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
I want to tell Eve.
... Sir?
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Yes. Of men and women.
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...
Let's have a look, do you mind?
... Yes. You can take me.
How long do we stay in here?
... Hmmm... Elevator.
... Evening, Chance.
Good morning, Louise.
Well, ain't that the truth...
Yes. I was there with Ben.
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
... How long have you been living here?
Compensated...?
How were you paid?
Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
Have you served in the Army?
Those trees were very young when I first arrived.
... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?
What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?
I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
I have no claim, Thomas.
But you won't sign, correct?
Good morning, Mr. President.
Try again.
Sid, it's useless!
Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
... Yes, I am, Ben.
And look who you brought with!
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling.
No, that won't do any good.
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
I can certainly understand that...
It's that gardener!
Good night.
Look, Johanna...
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
This is not what I requested.
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
Yes, I did.
It's that serious, huh?
Take care of yourself, Ben.
You take care too, Bobby.
Yeah.
Malkovich.
The one where you're that jewel thief.
Who am I thinking of?
Hello, I'm here about the ad.
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Which one is Elijah again?
The monkey.
Why'd you do it, Craig?
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
Yeah, just an idea I had.
She's very beautiful.
Hi.
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
The ferret?
The iguana.
Yeah. You want a beer?
Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.
I want to try.
I'll meet you on the turnpike.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
I have to go back now.
Why?
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
What are you doing?
You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
You've always hated the animals.
What's that?
What about Maxine?
Fuck Maxine.
Yes.
And he was with her.
We?
Me and John.
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
Suck my dick!
Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
It'll never happen, fuckface.
What's that?
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
It's Elijah.
The iguana?
A better friend.
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Simulates?
Sure, after a fashion.
So how was it?
That... was... no... simulation.
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
Schwartz.
Pardon?
My name is Schwartz.
Money, Miss Warts?
Mr. Juarez?
Yex?
Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid Im in love with somebody else.
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
Dr. Lester...
No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
Emily Dickinson.
Who told you?
I'm right?
Just.
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
You married?
What'll you have?
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
Yikes.
This is important!
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Tickets to Malkovich?
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
You wanted to be partners with me?
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
You're late.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
Lotte? Is that you?
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
Hello, Don.
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
No. Don't be an ass.
Can I be anyone I want?
Two hundred dollars, please.
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
But I think I have another plan.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Thank you, Floris.
Think, Jew florist?
Do you dream often?
Says who?
Says me. Do you dream often?
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
Do we get to wear a crown?
But of course.
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
I'm getting divorced.
No you mustn't, my child.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
No, I didn't know that.
No.
Aaaahhhh, the portal!
No! Don't harm the vessel!
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
I love you, Lotte.
We have to meet.
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
Did you see the reviews?
She's not available.
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
Great then.
Is there dancing?
No.
Yeah?
Mr. Malkovich?
Can I get you a drink?
Thanks so much for coming over.
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
Lotte called me.
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
You mean with Malkovich?
I'd love to see your work.
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
Vegas.
I've got to leave Malkovich.
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
Yeah what?!
Good-bye, Maxine.
Captain Mertin?
There ain't.
Folks came.
Folks come. Folks go.
I got a delivery around here. Name of Tucker.
Well?
The Word. What you was put here to speak.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
No, Stamp. I ain't.
You saying nothing counts?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
Not like He punished me.
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
Was a time I knew what was.
We have to be steady. "These things too will pass". What you looking for? A miracle?
Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
YOU HURT ME.
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
What do you know about it? I sleep where I want.
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YES.
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
You don't sit with me!!
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
I want somethin' sweet.
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
Well, is it now? How you getting along?
Don't pay to complain.
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
Well, if you want my opinion...
I don't. I have my own.
You grown.
Yes sir
Well, good luck with the job.
Yes?
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
Oh.
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
Fine. But what would I do at night?
Be here. In case.
I want to work, Miss Lady.
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
Could be that fall you took.
Should I wake her?
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
Morning.
But mama..
No...no...no..
Out where?
Was over to Baby Suggs.
I know Denver.
You sure?
I know what I see.
True.
Better ask Paul D.
Can't locate him.
He's sleeping in the church.
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
He ask, I give him anything.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
I don't know him that well.
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
It's her, ain't it?
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
You was friends.
Till she showed herself.
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
I run him off.
He knew Baby Suggs?
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
You planning to do anything about it?
You remember your price, Stamp?
Jesus.
It ain't what you think.
Leave off..
Who is she? Where she come from?
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
Sethe?
You shaved.
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
You got to get up from here, girl.
What, baby?
What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late?
What? What? You talking back to me?
Make it the way I always do.
Hey!!
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Fuck.
What do you think?
Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie Treehorn wants to see you.
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
Uh-huh.
This is our concern, Dude.
I know my rights.
I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I want Bill Kunstler.
Hey, man, I'm not--
The Gundersons.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Fuck, man!  That's terrible!
Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
Come and get it.
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!
Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.
NUSSING!
Excuse me?
Can we just rent it from you?
Yeah.
What's this?
That is for the urn.
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
Fuckin' A.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
Sheesh.
Where you going, Dude?
I'm going home, Donny.
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
Almost five!
What tied the room together, Dude?
Yeah Walter, what's your point?
What's a pederast, Walter?
I am the Walrus.
Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!
What the fuck is he talking about?
They posted the next round of the tournament--
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
It's already posted.
I'm shomer shabbas.
Oh yeah, how'd it go?
Who has your undies, Walter?
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
They were Nazis, Dude?
Uh-huh.
Are you gonna split hairs?
No--
Am I wrong?
What have you.  We'll, uh--
Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?
I pull over and kick your ass out, man!
Please, feel free to inspect them.
I'm not really, uh.
Please!  Please!
Nancy's pretty good.
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
Different mothers, huh?
Jeez.  Think he's got room for one more?
1972 Pontiac LeBaron.
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
And what do you do, sir?
...Also, my rug was stolen.
No.  Here.
Far from it.
Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
Take it easy, Dude.
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I gotta get back.
Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
What's your drink, Dude?
White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!
Yeah man.
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
"Johnson"?
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
I was talking about my rug.
You're not interested in sex?
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
No it's fine, really, uh--
And please don't call her my mother.
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
From who?
The main guy, Dieter--
Dieter Hauff?
Well--yeah, I guess--
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
Well yeah...I know that.
Delayed after-eff--
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
Huh?  He's fucking loaded.
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
Well...no, of course not--
Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
What the fuck are you--
No, but--
Am I wrong!
Yeah, but--
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
Theodore Herzel.
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
You mean--beyond pacifism?
No, you're not wrong--
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
Anyway.  How much they offer you?
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--
What if it's during a game?
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.
Have it your way.  The point is--
It's your roll--
The fucking point is--
What the hell is this?
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
Oh shit.  Walter.
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?
Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about that poor woman?  What do we tell--
That's it.  I'm out of here.
You don't know, Walter?  You seem to know the answer to everything else!
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
That wasn't her toe.
What about the toe?
Not if I have anything to say about it.
They're nihilists.
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Who the fuck is that?
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
Uh-huh.
The bulk of the series.
Uh-huh.
Not exactly a lightweight.
Is this your homework, Larry?
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your homework, Larry?
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
It is a fucking emergency.
Yeah?
Walter, come off it.  You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
What the fuck are you talking about?
Yeah, and you were--
This driveway.
It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
Oh, shit.
He can't walk, Walter!
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.
What's mine is mine.
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
No Dude.
There weren't any shots.
Then what's...
It's a heart attack.
Call the medics, Dude.
Walter Sobchak.
Well can we--
We're scattering the fucking ashes!
Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking asshole!
You make everything a fucking travesty!
What about that shit about Vietnam!
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--
Dude here.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Another Caucasian, Gary.
Right, Dude.
Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.
Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
Did I urinate on your rug?
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
Are you employed, sir?
Is this a--what day is this?
Dude.
Huh?
Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!
Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.
Well?  Aren't you?
Oh, shit.
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
Yeah, but--
I'm not--
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
You happy, you crazy fuck?
Whatta we do about the Mex?
We'll take 'em in the morning.
<i>You'll</i> take him.
He's half yours, partner.
Why?
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
Where to first?
What was that?
You're hurt.
I'll heal.
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
Anyone else make it?
Thank you.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
It means "bloodbrother."
How does it look?
What do you want me to do?
Did you think I wouldn't?
What do you think?
Sounds like a plan.
I don't like it.
I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
Where were you, Whistler?
Your security's for shit, kid.
Where the hell have you been?
What's your problem, Whistler?
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
Put it back in park, Blade.
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
What's going on?
He was here.  Watching us.
Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!
From his father, of course.
We're locked in.
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
They've made contact with the Reapers.
Any casualties?
An inevitability, I suppose.  Nyssa was not among them, I trust.
Not that I'm in contact with.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Tell me something, Skid --
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
Nope.  Back then we did not.
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
Going on twenty years now.
What about you?  You're not coming?
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
She's been bitten.
You should've killed her, then.
Get in. Youre leaving.
What took you so long?
Beautiful day, isn't it?
You're not going anywhere.
No longer.
Who dies first?
Is something wrong, my friend?
I am tired. Dawn is coming.
But I just got here --
You shouldn't be here.
-- he's a vampire.
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
You used me as bait?!
It worked, didn't it?
But, he could've --
What are you doing?!
You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
There is no cure.
What are you looking at?
What do you see here?
Graffiti --
How can you tell?
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
Like what?
What is this place?
You're hurt --
What am I injecting you with?
It's dark in here.
I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
Just get out of here.
Is he sick?
Any progress?
Some. It's been slow --
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
Are you all right?
I've been better --
How long have we been driving?
It won't work on you.
Get out of here --
I'm not leaving without you.
-- tearing me -- apart.
How's it going, Kam?
You're a week early.
Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
But you -- died --
Deacon brought me back.
How could you be a part of this?
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
This isn't human blood.
Then what is it?
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
You haven't started in on the internal organs?
That's weird --
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
How do you like that? Right on time.
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
We keep in radio contact.
Whistler!
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
Why do you hunt them?
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
--and if she ever did--
--or incredibly fucking naive.
Why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings--who <u>cares</u>?
I don't...I don't understand them myself.
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
What happened to her, where did she go?
Not that I can see.
No.
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??
--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--
Please! Please...? I haven't done anything.
Domini?
Yes.
What're you doing there?
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
--stop it! Stop talking about it! I'm gonna freak!
Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
No!
Mrs. Leavitt--
--I'm not staying here!
Let's talk to your husband--
Shit? This is from "Josh's Blair Witch Mix," man!
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
"The Voiiiiices made him do it."
Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
Druid Hill Park.
--the witch kills children--
Cheery little place.
You sure?
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
You don't want it though.
Your body, your call.
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
Anna--
What?
You said the name "James."
Baby names?
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
I think we get the gist.
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
--now c'mon!
What can I get you?
Nothing. I dunno--
--you should get back into bed.
Was that you laughing?
What?
Just...try and go back to sleep.
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
I can't.
I want to see something!
Are you marked like this??
I know, I know.
Absolutely.
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
The, uh, blur there.
You want a hand?
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--
How'd you know they were--
I don't know yet.
Hey, <u>chill</u>, man--
Turn the tapes back on.
Does it hurt?
There, what? I didn't see anything.
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
--go!
The witch?
You're a complete fucking idiot, aren't you?
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
I don't believe this.
That's what Josh and Mike said.
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
What movies?
Yeah?
No fucking.
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
We should be so lucky.
What're you, crazy??
Get <u>out</u> of here!
--yeah, a hand or something--
--Cotter: shut up.
Get inside quick, they'll stop.
Too busy eating us?
Mi casa y su casa!
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
Whatta you got, telescopic vision?
Where's Domini?
Fire escape??
She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
Cotter?
Where?
Not the place you want to announce your arrival.
How's she going to know where to--
It's <u>freezing</u>.
What the fuck--??
--I saw what I saw.
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
Be it still alive, James?
I'd strongly advise you to join us--
That's a "j."
For "James?"
Who?
Hold this.
What?
--Graduate Thesis--
--Cotter--
--a Wiccan--
Cotter?
What're you doing?
This isn't about us.
Was it <u>every</u> day or just semi- weekly you got your ass kicked as a kid?
What?
Okay, but--
They're making "Blair Witch II," too.
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
Let's get inside.
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?
Running a junk yard.
--whatever you want, no problem--
You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?
Just let it go, I've got you!
What're you nuts--
What?
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.
Ah, Domini?
You planning on sleeping out there?
Ripped? They look like they were <u>bit</u> off.
That's almost a year's worth of work!  Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....
Pointless.
Women miscarry all the--
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
What'd you see?
Cotter'll kill you.
Still working on it.
Dad...?
Are you alright?
Jesus.
What?
That's why she kills children.
You gonna be alright?
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
What're you afraid's going to happen?
The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.
She <u>wasn't</u> a witch.
She's off her fucking rocker--
--I know!
--a <u>lot</u>.
Heather.
Yeah.
Okay. Hypothetically.
Domini's the only logical explanation.
I can't do it!
Gothic rune--the letter "S."
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
She's far from "fine."
No. We <u>all</u> go.
Anna--
"It's why the witch kills children."
Why?
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
--yes--
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
Who <u>is</u> this??
Your mother's pastor.
No, I--
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
Yeah.
Where... where you going?
Who was it?
On the phone. Was it for you?
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?
Well... the couch would be all right...
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
You wouldn't be putting me out.
...Well I'll be damned.
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
...Mm-hmm.
When you don't they're usually nice.
...You ever get tired?
Hello?
Abby... you all right?
Ray?... What time is it?
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
...What?
What happened?--Was Meurice there?
...That's what's important.
...Who?
...What's going on with you two?
...Where is everything?
...But first I gotta know what happened.
...So?
So how long have you know Meurice?
...So what're you doing tonight?
It'll pass.
I own the place.
What night is it?
I told you. I like you.
See, I never knew that.
Well now you do.
No.
...What was that back there?
Back where?
Sign.
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
Then what'd you come here for?
...You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing.
What did you take these for?
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
How long did you watch her?
Now that don't make much sense.
You want me to kill 'em.
I didn't say that.  Well?
Well what?
What do you think?
...There's a big--
Yeah. Is it...
Ya catch any fish?
...What?
Ya catch any fish?
Yeah...
...What kind of fish?
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
Dead, huh?
Of course.
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.
Has Ray come in yet?
How would I know?
What's this?
Red Label.
Right. Sorry.
Pour that back.
What.
Don't throw that out.
What's this?
What.
Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it.
That's not the point.
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
...I thought you were dead. Going home?
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Thanks Meurice.
Tuesday is ladies' night.
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Jeffrey. you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
Are you Detective Williams?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Come into the study a minute.
Okay.
The criminals are winning.
What is this? What color is it?
What color is it?
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Is Sandy part of this?
No. not at all.
Who knows you have these?
Only you. and the photo lab.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Hello, baby.
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
Hello, daddy.
Yes, but.
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Those are my breasts.
Can I feel 'em?
Bull.
Alright, suit yourself.
Yes? What is it?
Pest control. gotta do your apartment.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
That oughta do it.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
I wanted to see you.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
Well.
THEN WHAT?
What do you want from me?
Do you like that?
No.
Nothing. Are you alright?
Sure I'm alright. 
Thank you. honey.
Yes.
Yes.
You can hit me, if you want to.
Do you like me?
Do you know?
You don't?
Hi. can I come in?
Oh shit.
Nice guy.  Who's he?
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Look.
No.
Don?. Are you in with them?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
No. I should go.
Come in.
It used to make me laugh .but.
Yes. Frank-
What do you want to do?
I'm doing it.
Are you a bad boy?
What do you want?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Does that scare you?
Shut up.
Beeeee careful.
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
I asked first.
I love you Don with all my heart.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
You called me Jeffrey.
I did. are you?
I guess I should go.
I want you to stay with me.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Oh no.
It's okay. it's okay.
Shh. I'll tell you.
They hurt his head.
Who, Dorothy?
Hold me, Don.
Don?. Where is he?
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
No thanks. what does that mean?
I don't want to go.
Go where?
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Hey? . You like to walk.
Okay Frank.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
There ya go.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Am I bothering you?
How is Central these days?
Terrible. boring.
What else is new?. right?
Yeah. What are you doing now?
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
What happened to him?
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Alright.
So. what's next?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.
That sounds good.
Here's to. an interesting experience.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Oh, okay. can I call?
What's with Mike?
He got a little jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't.
You want a Dairy Queen?
You saw a lot in one night.
. Actually. I've been in twice.
Twice. without her sensing anything?
Yes.
Did you see her undressed?
That doesn't bother you, does it?
That's what I thought.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
You better not, Jeffrey.
Okay. okay.
Goodnight.
You were late.
What am I going to do?
Yeah.
You like mysteries that much?
Okay.
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
It's okay.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
You want to dance?
I can't dance fast.
Let's wait for some slow one.
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Dorothy! ... Dorothy!
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
I should go with her, Sandy.
Go ahead.
... Sandy?.
Hi Dad.
uh uh.
Are you feeling okay?
Good to see you, son.
How ya doin' Dad?
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Well. Okay.
I'm going out for awhile.
Can I use the car tonight?
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Yeah, I know.
Would you like a piece of cake?
He comes over to study.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
That sounds great!
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Sandy? ...Sandy, please.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
What are watchin' this junk for?
You can change it if you want to.
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?
I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
Greetings, Mr. George.
Where do you guys want to count?
Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Nothing like this back home.
This is it for me.
You happy, baby?
Are you sure this guy is cool?
This is it for me.
You happy, baby?
Should we buy it?
Are you kidding?
Honey, your nose!
You wanna split?
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
Tuna, this is crap.
Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
Something about vengance being best served cold.
Not so fast.  I would like to go over the details.
What?  Yeah, sure.
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
Why are you speaking?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
What the fuck is that?
What can I do for you guys?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
What the fuck is that?
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
Nice doing business with you, George.
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.
For calling you a homo.
Christ almighty, George.  Feed her a cheeseburger or something.  What does she weight, eighty pounds?
Oh hey, one more thing?
What's that?
Your offense?  Why are you here?
I don't want to talk about it.
Not really, no.
Murder.
What do you got there, Diego?
Nothing.  Just a little project.
What kind of project?
Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
Because I got caught.
No, my brother.
Because they caught me?
Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
Yeah, I'm out.
Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
But you must.  It's the only way.
I just got released five minutes ago.
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.
Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
Three million.  I counted it twice.
I'm calling it three.
We're half a million off.
There's no room.
You're a lucky man, Diego.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
Take it easy!  Everything's okay!
Derek Foreal.
You fucked me, Diego.
You went behind my back and you cut me out.
Coke.
Cocaine?  How much?
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
G-d, son.
It's a family heirloom.
I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap.
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
Power?
Yeah, maybe.
Sure.
Beautiful girls?
Money.
And Diego?
George, you look terrible.
Yeah, well...
Diego?
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
You mad at me?
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
She's angry.  It's all over the news.
You're not going to trial?
No.
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
Tell Mom, you know...
That was a beautiful message.
How are you doing, George?
What do you guys want?
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
What the fuck?  Is he going to walk?
Figured it out.
George.
Figured it out.
Hello.
Do I know you?
I don't think so.
Why are you smiling?
Why are you smiling?
I don't know.  My name is George.
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
She did that before.
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
But this is...
Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
Not in front of the kid.
What do you want?
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
Hey, George.  You okay?
Kristina's fine.
Mirtha, how are you doing?
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
Well, here I am.  See?
Dad.
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
You mean, like a trip?
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
California, huh?
Where are you going?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
But I've got school.
There's schools in California.
I don't believe you.
I swear.  On my life.
Swear on my life.
It's alright, Dad.
I didn't mean to...
I fucked up.
But I have a visitor.
Okay, George.
Because she's visiting me.
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
For instance, something like this?
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
It's not enough.
Holy shit, Dulli!
No shit, Kevin?
This is bullshit, George.  We're never going to find anything down there.
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
The strike is a success; but ...
Dien Bien Phu?
In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.
And here?
Sid Ahmed.
Which "district" do you belong to?
Second district ...
Second district ... Explain better ...
Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
What "group"?
Third group.
Third group. What's your assignment?
You afraid of these ...?
It's true.
What's happened to you?
What ... What must I decide?
With an unloaded pistol?
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
I don't do that kind of thing.
Of course. As soon as possible.
Can you read?
Read it.
It's good nobody is following us ...
But it's not even midnight yet!
Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.
Tell me ... Where is this rue de Thèbes?
Rue de Thèbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
A name?
Who is speaking?
How can I give you this statement?
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
Are you ready, colonel?
You got something on the coke?
Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.
You did a good job, Charlie.
About three hours.
The official cause?
That's what my report will read.
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.
Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
No.
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Like cats and dogs.
Sex.
No -- never.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.
No questions.
Objection, Your Honor.
Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
She's innocent.
I've got work to do.
Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.
I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
Can I go?
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
A little after eleven.
Why did you come by?
I had some papers to pick up.
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
Her name?
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
No -- never.
What about Miss Lawson?
Yes.
How did he look?
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Is it Marsh?
Who found him?
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
About a year and half ago.
Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.
We were lovers.
How long were you together?
What kind of condition are you referring to?
What happened next?
I had bypass surgery.
Why not?
Why did she say she was leaving?
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
Yes.
Who was your primary beneficiary?
She was.
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
Did you suggest any?
-- And what did you suggest?
You'll be sorry?
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
Why does she come to you?
What did you prescribe for her?
Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
No.
I heard him say it.
Yes.
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
Did he make your life miserable?
Yes -- he did.
Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
No.
What about Miss Lawson?
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
I don't know.  I'm not sure.
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
Who told you that?
He video taped you.
I've been to a few -- yes.
Three fifteen.
A.M -- or P.M.?
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
Hi, Joe.
Yes.
Do you think I did it?
No pain, no gain?
Something like that.
Yes.
Can we get out of here?
This is your house.
Is it against the law?
What do you think?
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
I'm the photographer.
Oh -- Well, they're different.
That's not an answer.
It's not my taste.
Hello?
Hi.  It's Frank.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
Sorry.
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
Really?
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
Yes -- it would be nice.
What would?
Is that what you think I was thinking?
There's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, Frank.
You lied to me!
She's mistaken.
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?
Alone?
You were brilliant today.
Can I see you later?
Something wrong?
I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.
Sugar or honey?
Rebecca -- take these off.
What are you going you doing?
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
I'm dropping the case.
You're a monster.
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
Alright, I'll talk to her
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
I love you.
Michael -- get off the phone.
Why?
Because I'm expecting a call.
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
But Your Honor--
Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
The witness will answer the question.
I can back it up.
I am relaxing.
Really?
If you want me to.
We're supposed to go to the lake.
I know.  What can I do?  He is the boss.
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
She sounds like quite a woman.
Humped
I'll talk to him later.
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
Is that alright, Frank?
Yeah -- what are you doing up?
Why did you lie to me?
I'm not.
I was thinking that when the trial is over we'd all go skiing for a weekend.
I know.
We can't pretend this isn't happening.
It's more involved than that.
Frank -- stop it!  Stop it!
Albert's got the stomach flu.
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Yes.
Did Marsh use it?
No -- never.
It had to get there somehow.
We were here two Christmases ago.
Well, that's a long time.
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
Well, I can help.
I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
No treasure maps, huh?
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
Mom's orders.
I thought everything WAS arranged.
Well, there's a problem.
Yeah.
Michael.
What?!
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
Don't say that!
Well, I'd like to read them.
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
Bar across the street.
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
I never knew that.
Nobody did.
She's changed.
Oh, yes.
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
Not this kind of heat.
What do you know about "the changes"?
Roseman Bridge?
Pretty country.
Maybe it's because I live here.
Oh. When did you move back?
After the divorce.
How long you been married?
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
Oh there you are.
Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection.
Oh, that's nice.
Want another cigarette?
Francesca.
Lemon?
Mind if I smoke?
Oh. How old?
About a year and a half.
No, your kids.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
I doubt that.
He's very... clean.
And clean.
Feeling better?
Much.
Is the dizziness gone?
What?
She starts sniffing me.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
Then what happened?
We got engaged.
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
Why did you stop?
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
My God. How I'd love to see that.
Smells like dirt.
You get used to it.
You want to go back in?
What?
Yes.
Francesca?
Woman friends, too?
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
I told you, I love other people.
But no one in particular.
No. But I love them just the same.
My mistake. I apologize.
What made you ask such a question?
Francesca?
Yes! Hi.
Am I interrupting anything?
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
Oh, sure. Great.
Okay. See you later.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
Yeah?
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
Would you like a beer for your bath?
You want to eat something?
Are you hungry?
Take me somewhere.
Yes.
Nobody's asking you to.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
No. I couldn't.
Why do you say that?
But you don't mind.
I had a temper.
I can't do this, honey.
Long day. Go to sleep.
Sleep all right?
WHY?
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
Yes. And I've accepted.
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
What time is it?
Later. Go back to sleep.
Now?!  It's after eleven.
I can't sleep.
I'm positive.
I'm going to miss you.
Franny?
Okay.
What's her name?
Betty.
What's she like?
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
Oh my God...!
About an hour ago.
They're not going to find her!
When did she decide this?
Don't feed that dog.
You people really don't like dogs.
Outta my way, boy.  Cinnabar?  I'm coming!
He yours, sir?
Hell no!
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
Died there?  How?
Hey, kid.
We practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club.
You didn't hear that?  "Take him... " Something.  "Bury him" or...
You think that's really him?
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
Damn.  That is the ugliest building I have ever seen.
Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.
Shit.
No.  Well, yeah.  Maybe just a little.
Where's the others?
Where's the gangsta of love?
You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.
Climb out to where?
Is this Hell?
That's what?
Wh-wh-whooo?
You got a nice crib here.
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
Just try it.
I said, no thanks.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
Where are we, baby?
Where we'll always be...
But.
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
What it will be.
What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
Aren't you going to join us?
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
In his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something.  Covered with blood.
Are they on the radio?
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
How do you know?
Careful.  That's bad luck.
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
The dead get out?
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
Cinn?
He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
I can't.  Not yet.
Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
I'm here.
Bill!  Bill?!
Patrick, he's...
We gotta jump!
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
You got the cash?
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.
What are we doing down here?
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
Please...help me...
What the hell do you want?
You certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  Nice lookin'.
I didn't sell it.
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
Nice rack.  How old is --
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.
Goddamnit!  How many times I told you --
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
Jimmy Bones?
Yeah, you heard of him?
You haven't?
I thought you were bringing the Colonel?
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
But the place burned to the ground.
Illibent?  Who's club is that?
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.
Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making too much noise.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
You shouldn't have hit me.
You want to get into this now?
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
So Caesar, what did it total out at?
Where is this going, Johnnie?
Just admit it, Caesar.
Know what?
Open the case!
All right!  Where's the key?
How the fuck can I open it?
You don't think I'll do it, do you?
I think you're fucking crazy!
Where is it?
Where's what?
The next one blows off your dick.
We know how this was done, eh?
Caesar?  What is this?
Sit down, Gino!
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
We're family, Caesar.
No!
Gimme the gun.
I can't.  I can't.
All part of the business.
I didn't expect --
Oh, shit ...
Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
So, you just got out?
Not bad.  What for?
Caesar, what happened?
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww goddammit!
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
They were early.
What are you talking about?
They just left, didn't they?
No!  They're still on their way.
That doesn't make any sense.
It couldn't have been.
It was him.  I'm positive.
Got to think this through ...
Caesar, maybe we should run --
You can't leave.
The hell I can't!
Tell them!  Tell them!
...  maybe three hours.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!
It's not here, Caesar.
What are you doing?
We're going to need some time.
Where is the money?
Don't tell him --
Shut up, Violet!
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Don't try to tell me what to do.
What did she do to you?
You betrayed me!
You murdered Gino!
We were in a car accident --
They were in a car accident.
But everybody is all right.
Now that's teamwork.
I should have let him kill you.
You know he would have done you, too.
How's it going tonight, fellas?
Not on duty, sorry.
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
You're helping Rajeev?
How many'd you do?
Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers.
I should be going.
Another time.
Lick me.
You can't kill me yet.
Why?
Yeah?
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Okay, sure, Mick.
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
We was worried about you, Cease.
Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
Is that the money?
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
It's Gino!  It's Gino!
You got the key?
Call me as soon as you get him.
Hello?
No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door.
See?  We're for real.
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
This is a beautiful place.
So this is temporary for you?
I guessed you were straight black.
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
Truck.
Truck.  Of course.
'63 Chevy.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
Thanks.
He said you lost something.
I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...
Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something --
Okay, one drink.
What do you want?
A beer?
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
No.
...  I needed that.
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
You have to ask?
He's a launderer?
How long have you been with him?
Almost five years.
Five years is a long time.
The redistribution of wealth.
I guess I wanted to.
I'm glad you did.
What's wrong?
What are you afraid of?
I'm not afraid of anything.
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
What you heard wasn't sex.
What was it then?
What about that guy this morning?
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.
Yeah.
Then what?  Exactly.
He hung it up.
What?
And where is it now?
It's in a case, on his desk.
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
That's his brother.
Yeah.
Yeah, twice.
Does Johnnie hit on you?
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
He does it right in front of him.
What time did you say they would be there?
Where will you be?
An accident.
What if he sees you?
I'm just asking, what if?
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
Not Caesar.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
Jesus, that's beautiful.
It's me.
What if he doesn't run?
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
okay, all right.
I'm still here.
Hey.
Hey.
How'd it go?
No.
Unbelievable.  Can you believe that, Violet?
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
I want a second opinion.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
-- he went inside! --
-- if we can get a clean shot --
Forget it.
What do you want to do?
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
Treadstone?
Paris.  I live in Paris...
Yes.
What do they want me to do?
...they won't let you go...
I don't think so.
We have to go home, Jason.
Keep it. 
Jason...  They can't let you go...
I don't know.
You're a U.S. Citizen?
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Right.
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
Look, maybe I should just...
Sir, you waited on line.
...yes -- oui -- uh...

Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
Yes.  Is he there?
Who?  Who came?
His brother.  You know his brother?
It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
Was it the break-in?
I need a ride.
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
I've got a situation here and --
Get the fuck away from my car.
So what's in Paris?
I said ten thousand.
You have blood on your pants.
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
I won't hurt you.
What if I say no?
I don't know.
What?  Like amnesia?
That's what I'm saying.
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
What are you talking about?
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
I was shot twice in the back.
I needed a break.
Where are we?
We're about an hour away.
You ever think maybe you have a family?
Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...
Looks familiar?
So this is it, right?
I should go.
Okay, so...
Thanks for the ride.
Look, I don't know what's up there.
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
-- no -- Marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that --
-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
You knew he was coming.
No.
I trusted you.
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
-- we'll explain it --
-- forget it --
Who paid the bill?
I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.
Nykwana Wombosi. 
I don't know. 
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
You could do that?
Stop where you are.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
Who is it?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
What was I thinking, right?
I can't protect you anymore.
Can I help you?
This your store?
Think I could rent a scooter?
Shit, we didn't sign in.
Is this it? --  -- this is it, right? --
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
Where's the dog?
My husband's out looking for him.
Get in the basement.
Wait a minute --
Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.
xxxxxx...
And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
Sir...
-- let's check that Interpol window again --
What?
Abbott wants to talk.
Tell him we're busy.
-- and they're sure it's him? --
-- he accessed the account --
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
-- what're you talking about? --
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
What if it doesn't come back?
You drink rum?
...ervices.
...your ducts?
... And then some.
...elephoned sir.
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
...ixed itself.
Machines don't fix themselves.
... fix themselves.
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
I think we'd better have a look.
What have you got there?
Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... Tuttle
Sign here, please.
Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
What? How do you know my name?
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
Er ... Thanks ...
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
You don't have to sing it.
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Go away.
Her name is Jill.
I'm waiting for my daddy.
Thanks very much Sam.
Too late? That's for me to say.
Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
Sam!
Jack!
You are late.
Triplets.
Hello, Jack!
Er, I knew you looked different.
Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.
Jack!!
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
Ah ...
Layton! Oh shit!
How do you mean?
How much do you know?
Not much.
Enough though, eh?
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
What has Tuttle done?
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
Er ... no.
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
Yes. I'm impressed.
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
{baffled) I don't follow you.
So what are you going to do about her?
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
And you're mine.
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
Take her off the list.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
Say it was a mistake.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
Do you know what you're doing.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
Jack, she's innocent!
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
Jack?... Jack?
Shut up!
You stupid bastard!
How could you do this to me?
Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
I want to report a wrongful arrest.
Is it stamped?
Where do I get it stamped?
But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
Are you alright?
It's you ... it's you ...
Who are you? Let go!
Ow! That hurt!
No.
Don't litter my cab!
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
You know, smoking's bad for you.
It's my fucking life.
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
Why?
Where are you taking me?
What?
Where are you taking me?
It does doesn't it?
What's going on here?
OK. What's in the parcel?
It's heavy.
Looking for you.
No, really.
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
We've got both.
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
Why don't you say, no system is perfect.
Well, no system is.
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Well, all wars do -
Who is this war against, Sam?
Well, terrorists of course.
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Every day?
Turn around!
What?
They'll be there waiting.
Who will?
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
I thought you arrested me.
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 
Cut it out, Sam.
Will you please turn back.
Get away!
Turn!
I was right! Step on it!
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!
Oh God! What have we done?
We? Don't blame me!
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
Shit! The house is on fire!
"And your children all gone."
Are you still following me?
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
I'm going to open it!
Yes.
What happened to you after ...
They're gone.
Are you sure?
Don't you like parties?
Don't do anything silly.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Oh my God, a mistake!
It's not our mistake!
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Information Retrieval.
Don't worry.
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
Would you really, Sam?
Really.
The refund for Tuttle!
Try next of kin.
Here. What do I do next?
That's it.
You are good to me Sam.
I delivered it.
Can I forget it?
Damn! Blast!
I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?
I never signed the form.
I did it for you.
It's what you wanted isn't it?
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
This is your dream girl, is it?
Sod it, it's broken!
My mother said it would be all right.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
I won't be held responsible.
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
I'm sorry but ...
You remember Samuel, my son.
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
Numero une, crevettes à la mayonaaise. 
What is it?
What were we saying?
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
Hello ... hello ...
Hello. Mr Lowry?
Put the phone down and your hands up.
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
My I.D. cards.
No need, sir
Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
Monsieur. Quel numero.
I don't know which numero.
I mean it fixed itself.
What the - ? How did you - ?
Sign here please.
What?
Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't just go and leave it like this!
For God's sake, what's happened?
What is it?
Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service.
Ha!!
Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?
Are you expecting anyone?
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
What do they want you or?
Thank you very much. How much will it...?
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
I've never fired anyone in my life.
Pregnant.
No, no, that's impossible.
Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
She say she in great pain.
Is she dying?
She's having a baby. Twins.
You can trust me on this one.
You know each other a long time?
Two years. Ever since we left island.
In that time, you ever have sex?
No underwear?
Hey Cy, guess who's here?
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
Frank, take it easy. what happened?
Mary said you might be coming.
Where is she?
Sleeping in the back.
She wanted something to help her sleep.
I guess I'll be going.
Does that hurt?
So, Frank, am I going to live?
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
What about Kanita?
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
Let's do it!  It's Marcus, Love, only for you.
Okay, what happened?
He's going to be all right, right?
No. He's dead.
What's his name?
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
You're not going to die.
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
Here, you try.
No, I'd better not.
Sure, sure, give go.
I know him. That's Noel.
Is there any chance?
It's my first cigarette in over a year.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
He's dead, huh?
Yes.
Our Lady of Misery.
Did you see my father?
It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.
How long you been doing this?
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
You asked me not to come.
I need to sit down a minute.
This is not a good time.
Who is it?
Frank.
My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy.
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
It's coming.  Hold her down.
What's that, Frank?
Three legs.
That's too many.
Backup?
Don't give me that look.
I'll drink to that.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
Where you going?
I quit! I'm through!
You can't believe how much he's improved.
No.
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
How can that be? He was getting better.
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.
These are hard times, Tom.
Yeah. Great, isn't it?
The brakes are shot.
I've taken that into consideration.
Mr. Oh.
Whadda we bring?
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
Let's get in a fight, then.
What do you want to break?
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
Frank!
Do it!
I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.
Oh no!--I just remembered.
I'm not hungry.
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
Turn it off.
That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
Don't push it, Larry.
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
Well why didn't you say so?
Faster! God!
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
He's crazy.
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
You're in the stomach!
You're in the stomach! Let me try.
Stomach again.
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
Shut up a second...
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.
I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.
Wait.
I don't like being handled.
Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
It's not loaded.
No.  No.
You were smokin' toward the end there.
What did they do with you?
They booted me out of Washington.
London.
London.  That's a promotion!
I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --
He excels at gratitude.
It's nice to see you.
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
Eventually rising to...
I don't like the word gay.
A half hour in the lobby.
Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
He must have been great-looking, right?
Okay.  Let's do me.
This conversation is not worthy of you.
Nine seconds.
Eleven and a half.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
Okay.  Great line at the end.
We can cut back at the end.
I write for you sometimes.
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
Jesus, Jane.  How long have you been here?
I didn't know you were going with him.
Did you bring your grey suit?
As good as humanly possible.
No.
Then it went well.
Did it really go well?
Define your terms.
Then what was good about it?
I lost six pounds...
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.
Don't go.
I think you're the Devil.
Don't say anything about anything.
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
Really?
I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?
Ready.
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
Oh, you mean use him...That's nice.  Okay.
Outside?
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
Okay.  I think I'd better be alone for a while.
We came from Washington.
Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
All this business of war -- do you get scared?
Okay.  I just wanted you to know.
What is she shooting?
I was a little nervous there for a minute.
Jane?
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
You don't have time.  Not a chance.
Play back the last line...
Do you want him all the way to the car?
Because...
They're not really going to call security are they?
No, I don't think so.
Follow me.
No...no.
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
Nobody else had it.
Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
Good.  He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.
...good-bye then.
Ernie, they're calling from work.
What?
Bye, sweetie.
Jane -- For God's sake...  Look, it's time for you to go to sleep.
No.  Not even you.
Why so glum?
I don't know.
No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.
Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will you sign it, please?
Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
I had no idea she was this good.
You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
Hi.
How's it going?
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
Nervous?
You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
Why, you need me for the story?
No.  Were you going to you?
Oh, good.
It's incredible who's here.
Who?
You okay?
At least kiss me when you do that.
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
Because you're nuts.
I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.
Hi.  It's me.
No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
Hello?
Okay.  Good night.
Then give me a minute...
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
Then you should stay here.
This is very awkward.
You're saying stay away from him.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
Where's the bathroom?
That's enough.  That's enough.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
Don't you work here?
Would you like to do me?
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
Tonight.
What, right now?
It's kind of dark -
Oh it's enough...
Are you nervous, Walter?
Not even a little bit?
A girl with a body like mine?
What!
Look -  This pose is all wrong!
Alright we're clear.
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
What did he do?
See you later -
You really like it?
Great!  What is it?
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
Is it murdered man?
You think she's better than Murdered Man?
More champagne, your majesty?
Walter!  Jeez!
Did you hear what he said?
Yes Walter.
It's true, isn't it?
I know what it is to be ignored.
I mean, you look so pretty.
Thank you.
Are you ready?
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
Goodbye.
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
You think I'm creative?
Of course I do!
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy.
Walter...there's...
Walter...stay away from me!
That's word for word.
It was.
Put it in the middle of the room!
Walter...I can't believe it.
Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...
Are you trying to be funny?
Are you alright?
What's the matter with you?
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
Look at that, man.  Big deal.
Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...
Man look at that get up !
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
What did he say?
Didn't you hear him?
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
Well I brought something, I wanted to show you.
What is it, your laundry?
Where'd ya buy that?
You...made that?
Dead Cat!
Dead Cat?
You want to buy it, put it in the club?
I didn't mean to.
Go home.
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
You know what that proves?
Yeah, why?
You might talk too much.
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
What do you have in the box?
Well, w-what did you do?
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
How ya doin'?
Hm.
Did you see my cat?
Police officer.
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
You're gonna shoot me!
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!
Walter shut up and relax!
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
Are you done with these?
I saw your...cat.
Did you like it Mister Brock?
Hi.
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
After that we go no more!
I won't say good luck, Walter.
I thought you didn't respect money!
I get it Walter.  I get it.
What do you get?
It's like...you've turned on.
You don't have to do anything!
T-tell him that?
If you see him.
Good night Walter...
What's all the noise in here!
I was just straightening up the place.
Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!
What's wrong with you!?!
I had him in my grasp.
The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
Well, um... litter?
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
Let's move out!
Buffy!  Looking tasty.
Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these guys want?
Booo!
Suck!
Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
It's coffee.
You're the guys from the movie!
Hey!  She wasted my dog!
Would you sleep with them?
Invite me in, Pike.
I'm fine.
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
Get away from here.
I'm hungry.
Did you see a girl come by here?
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Which way did she go?
Excellent.
Oh, my God.  Is that true?
Dying.
Hi, Buffy.
Do you know what time it is?
Buffy, honey?
Maybe.
What's Bobby gonna say?
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
You okay?
Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
What show is this?
What'd you dream about?
Nothing.
Come on, what was it?
Hey there.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
Buffy, what are you doing here?
I thought we were meeting here.
No, you didn't.  When?
Didn't you get my message?
You broke up with my machine?
You left me a message?
You're even weaker than the others.
I am a God!  A God!
Will you guys shut up, please?
You want some water or something?
Not exactly.
They were vampires, weren't they?
Yeah.
Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
Where are you gonna go?
Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
Things are kind of confusing.
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
Hey, Buffy...
I know.
Thanks.
Who?
I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing?
A dress.
Dress, huh?  What for?
For the dance.
Come again?
I'm going to the senior dance.
I'm going to the dance.
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
He did what he was supposed to.
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
I crashed your party.
Pretty shallow of you.
That's me.
Good thing one of us was prepared.
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
It is a pretty crucial subject.
Can't.  History report.  The Normans and the Saxons.
Bogutude.  Blow it off.
Like what?
Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
) What do you think?
What are we doing?
Why don't we see a movie?
Excuse much!  Not rude or anything.
What did Jeffrey's dad say?
Let's meet tonight, okay?
Where?
I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
Yeah, whoops I came.
You look way pretty, Kim.
I'm looking for you, actually.
What are you talking about?
Why?
To bring you... your birthright.
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
Time to do what?
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
Just stay away from me, okay?
I was a slave.
How do you know all this?
Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
Ow.
Cramps?
None of your business.  God.
All right.  What do we do now?
Where's the other one?
Meet me at this address after school.
I have cheerleading squad.
Why do you keep saying that?
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
What?
But you enjoyed it, yes?
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
Who we gonna beat?
Who we gonna beat?
No -- you don't have to --
Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
I had to test you.
But you threw a knife at my head!
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
They were vampires?
Same one.
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
You are such a wet.
Five?
Not if you're careful.
I wish you would.
As for example, what?
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
Wait!
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
No THX.
That's the plan.
Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
-- like she's gonna kill me.
I was just scared is all.
That is so cool.
Thank you very much.
Cassandra's really smart.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
Nicole...
Hi, guys.
I haven't seen him tonight.
What's happening?  What do you want?
So very much.
Really?
I'm just a girl.
Bessel!  What are you doing here?
Could be.
You think so?
Buffy?
No --
Okay, let's go.
I can't believe they still ate it.
And Spring Fling.
Omniplex?
I never thought of that.
Cool!
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
They'll kill us!
Oh, God.
God!  Take a chill lozenge.
The homelesses?
Environment.  That's cool with me.
Oh, yeah!
If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
Smell of booze much.
Oh, thank you very much.
Except for Prom.
It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
Ah, you'll be coming back.
I don't think so.
You mean Nuke.  You said "Crash".
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
Big League pitchers don't use these.
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
The right nostril.  Good.
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
How was that?
A little better.
Just till I lose.
Get over here.
No.
No, no, it was great.
How 'bout a back rub?
I'll tuck you in.
That's my leg.
Fundamentals?
No!  You're playing with my mind!
I'm trying to play with your body!
Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
He did?
We lost.
I'd like you to meet my father.
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
It's Skip, for you.
That's great!
Well I guess this is it.
Neither will I.
I think I'm ready for the Show.
Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?
Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.
I'm Crash Davis.
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
She's dancing with me.
Crash, I didn't think you--
Oh my...  Don't leave...
But you were pulling your hips last night.
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
Damn.
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
Damn.
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
He' s confused--
Aren't we all?
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
And now you wanta teach me?
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
It's possible.
I got released.
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
Yeah...you a witch?
Annie---
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
Ninety-five miles an hour.
Oh dear....easy honey...
Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
Ninety-three miles an hour.
Ebby's told me a lot about you.
God bless you.
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
You need a nickname.
Which one of us?
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
The socks?  It's cold in here.
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
Will that work for me?
If you believe in Voodoo.
No, that is not belief.  That is desperation.
I got him on the knee!
Don't bump me.
It was a cocksucking call!
You spit on me!
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
You're a cocksucker!
I thought I was--
But he ain't seen my heat--
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
Well, I held it like an egg.
He did know.
You been in the Majors?
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
Can I ask you something?
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
What's wrong?
Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.
I'm going to the Show.
I'm trying to thank you.
Settle what?
You fuck!
Good.  Good.  That's terrific...
Sorry about last night.
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.
Nuke--  Good luck.
I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
Step outside, pal.
I don't believe in fighting.
Take the first shot at me.
I ain't hitting a man first.
Don't try me.
Who you calling a "boy"?
Hi, Jimmy.  Want a ride?
Can I give you my testimony?
Well tell 'em, honey.
Where's Ebby?
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
Little high.
He walked eighteen?!
It's a league record.
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.
Patkin was a tribute to baseball...
What the hell's going on out there?
It's a damn convention.
What'you want, kid?
Jim looking for somebody.
Who ain't?
Looking for Crash Davis.
Ain't here.
Where does he go?
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
Thank you.
I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.
Look at yours.
Hi, Ace.
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
You were never my guest?!
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
Was I at that dinner?
You were wandering around.
This is a very auspicious occasion.
A powerful man.
You got it.
...stupid things.
Watch it, partner, watch it!
Oh, good.
Yeah.
Okay, Randy. Thank you.
Stop -
Wait, hold on a second.
Hey!
M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
Hello.
She's not here, Sam.
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone.
Right away.
I'll call you right back.
Amy! Amy, open the door!
I can't! I'm tied!
When did this happen, honey?
I don't know.
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
I'll take Columbia for twenty.
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
Okay, Sammy.
Somethin', huh?
Yeah.
No, of course not.
...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
I'm sorry about this. Really.
All right, Ace?
Okay.
Hello.
Hey, Ace.
You should say so.
I don't wanna come along with you.
Just say so.
I'll be honest with you.
You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
Yeah.
You lost your control.
I lost control?
My wife?
Hey, she came to talk...
Please...
...don't do it to me...
It's none of my business?
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
Practice enough this week, you prick?
Meet me at three.
What - what, Caesar's?
No, a...
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
Ginger called me.
I just told you. She called me.
And what'd she want?
She was afraid to call you.
Sammy.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
It's me.
Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?
No, I'm not okay.
Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
Hey, it is my pleasure.
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
No problem.  Sorry.
Okay. You come by the house?
I'll come by.
Seven o'clock?
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
You go and put your things away.
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Hello.
Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
You've got to stop her.
No, Ace.
Half of everything is mine.
Ace, listen to me.
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
Well, sir, I was just...
I...
...position...
It's always been our policy -
We need this guy.
We can't get rid of him?
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
Nice to see you, Senator.
Certainly.  Senator.
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
To Abraham Lincoln.
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
Sam, we got a problem.
No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
Okay. Just take it easy.
Right away. Okay?
I-I'll do it.
I'm going to go powder my nose. 
Ginger's mission in life was money.
I'll be right back.
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
She took care of the dealers...
Hey, Mitch.
...pit bosses, floor managers.
Thank you.
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
I - I - I...
You all right?
Yeah.
Why're you crying?
Yeah.
You're with me now.
Yeah.
Right?
You sure?
It's chinchilla.
Oh, it's so soft.
It's nice isn't it?
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
Okay, want to go with Mommy?
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
Why do you need that much?
Yeah, how do I know?
You can't make me stop caring...
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
What's it...
...under?
Pretty serious.
How serious?
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
It's under...
...twenty-five thousand?
Yeah.
...the rest of the two million is still there?
Okay?
So, what'd ya do with it?
With the money.
He needed some clothes.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
He wanted a watch, too.
Mm-hm.
Would you knock it off, Sam?
Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!
I want you out of here! I want you out of here!
Take your  fuckin' bag and get out of here!
The arrangement is over!
You're lower than a dog!
Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there!
Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
You're not takin' Amy.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.
I put her to bed.
Oscar wants you to call him.
With Jennifer.
And where'd you go?
What'd you have?
I had a... salad.
Why do you want to do that?
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
Who were you with?
What if he won't stop?
I mean, it could get us both killed.
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-
Oh, sh-
Listen to me.
Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
You want your jewelry?
Get - get up!
I wouldn't do that...
You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
You get down here!
You come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
Don't you threaten me!
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
You are not threatening me anymore!
Oh, you are...
I am calm!
But it was just mine.
...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without...
...Well, I've got a large family.
It won't happen again, Sam.
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
Can't do it with both hands?
Can you do it with your left hand?
Well, I... I never tried.
Excuse me.
What?
Is this yours? Your pen?
Yeah.
Get out of here.
Yeah?
No, no? You didn't?
I don't want to go to Europe.
You know where she gets this from!
I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
You gotta go back out there.
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
Mrs Ro- Mrs Rothstein! Okay, shh!
Fucker!
Can I go in?
That's not a problem, that's not a p-
Can I go in?
Go get a bag, man.
And here. Here.
You just - Just stop him.
Pitch-black?! It -
Hey!
Come on. I'm sorry.
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Leave me alone!
Here we go!
Is that what you did?
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
It's instinctive, you know.
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
He's comin' over.
We're waiting on Carmine.
Carmine left?
He's gone?
He's not here?
Carmine left?
Artie!
Calm down! Calm down!
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
Stay out of the way!
Artie! Artie!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
Hey, Frankie.
I'll take care of it, Remo.
I know.
It's in all the papers.
What're you gonna do?
And I mean... that's no good.
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
No. I ain't see anything like that.
I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
I understand.
You got a round figure on it?
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
Yeah.
Hi, Jennifer.
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
Sure.
Okay.
All right?
Thanks.
Thank you.
You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
What? What?
Yeah?
Let me think about that.
Mm-hm.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
You did. You're right.
I did what you told me to.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
Sure did.
I do. I need a new sponsor.
Is that what you want?
Yeah.
A sponsor.
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's what you want?
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
Get the fuck out of here.
All right. Be careful.
So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
...same outfit.
Yes!
Thank you. Very nice.
Come on.
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
Get lost?
Yes.
Well, how 'bout that?
All right.
Okay?
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
I'm always here for you.
You are.
Don't make me come there. Answer me.
No, Lester.
Promise?
...all the luck in the world.
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
It means I got the money.
Lester - he called you here.
Right.
He called you right here.
What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.
No, I'm gonna drive.
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
Listen...
...they're in Penthouse K.
They check in alone?
They checked in alone.
Are they out now?
Yes, don't worry.
There's more!
Hey, how you doin'? 
Incredible.
Two.
Mm-hm.
You know why, right?
'Cause it clogs up your heart.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Ace saw Vegas one way.
Smarten up.
Get up.
Come here, come here.
What's takin' so long over there?
She asleep?
I took care of everybody.
You walk past me?
Hey. This is Shelly.
And this is Stacy.
Stacy. 
This is Nick.
Fine. Everything's goin' good.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
It's up to you.
Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
They're havin' a good time too.
You must have drunk too much.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
Yeah, what's to stop him?
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
Angelo and Buster.
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
Don't know.
Calm down, calm down. Shh!
Whoa. Calm down.
Get out. Get out! Get out!
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
Frankie!
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
No, no, no, no!
Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!
Ch-Charlie M!
Charlie M?
Tony.
Hey.
How you doin'?
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
You sure?
I'm positive.
Well, I'm a little confused here.
You're a little confused?
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
Do I hear a motion seconded?
Oh, sorry -
That's enough.
Take it easy, though.
All right, all right. But I - I -
Hi.
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
The crowd bought it.
Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.
You say that like an amnesia victim.
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
Are you sure?
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
There you are darling...Have we met, Lewis Lane, Oasisburg Times.
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
She has a real spirit.
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
God, can you hear me!
Wha-at?
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
Yeah, this is better than rape.
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
What a "drag."
Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.
God-damn..
What did you say?
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
Car wash, Captain?
My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
Oh, I wish they wouldn't feed him like that.
I still have one left...
You think so?...Selina?
Spooky.
For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
What's the name of your child's best friend?
How much?
But of course you are.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Hey, Captain God!
What did--?
Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
Did you try to kill...
You are...
You're late.
I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
I don't know if I can do it alone.
What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for?  Dance with me?
Nice breasts.
Where do you think you're going?
Any place.
I don't see anybody in there but you.
Was someone in an accident?
I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
Have you got to tell her your life story?
What if they do question the authenticity?
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
Who's on the phone?
What was that for?
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
Theo wants to talk again.
Will you two cut it out?
Then whose is it?
You gotta just look the other way.
Are you guys all right?
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?
Let's have your license, mister.
How do we get back to the freeway?
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.
You switched license plates?
Bullshit.
What do you mean tip the cops?  Is the man a lunatic or what?
I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
If you know that just back off.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
And stop with the directions.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
I thought you said you could handle him.
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
Will you let me explain!
And what're you whispering for?
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
I don't believe you.
My name is --
I don't want to know --
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
You won't disconnect.
Oh won't I?
Because you know you'll be killing us.
Don't lay this on me!
The cops could trace this call back to you.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
How much time do you have left on it?
A woman?
What do you do for a living?
Sometimes I paint.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
That makes two of us.
Make a right.  You can't miss it.
Lenore, I'm here.  I'm getting out.
Does she wear glasses?
No.
What's happening?
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
The one in Brentwood.
What bank?
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.
What do you mean?
Not a chance.
Don't say that.
Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
Did you jiggle the phone?
No.
Did you hear that click?
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
No.  I hear them.  They're coming upstairs.  They know!
Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
Lucky for them they didn't.
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
Yes sir.
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
Rachel -- Oh my God.
Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.
Now I have -- it's a long story.
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
He had a gun.  I have it now.
You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
There isn't any such person.
The guy with the transplant.
Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
You timed that beautifully.
As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
I thought it was inspired.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
Who's in back?
L.A.P.D.
Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello.
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
A typical fuck-up.
You were at the Emerald that night?
What's Nels' number?
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.
What's really on your wicked little mind?
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
Naturally.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
That's not good enough.
Took preparation.
Know what else is in here?
You won't live to see it.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ...
Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
Who is this?
Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
Where do we meet?
What time frame have you got in mind?
Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
I'm here.  Where are you?
I don't know what you mean.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
Stop the crying.
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
Seems like it.
What's he doing?  Answer me!
Who am I talking to?
If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
I thought you'd know me by now.
What does it take to kill you?
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
I can see the benefit in that.
How far off are you?
Five minutes.
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
Who were you talking to?
Since when did you guys start changing tires?
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
Who are you?
Can I make a quick call?
Government business?
Undercover.
You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
So can we consider you a regular, sir?
It takes all types.
He's what she should run a mile from.
She's not a girl, Col --
See that, Col?
See what, Dil?
He gave me a look.
Yeah?
What you think?
Saw that one.
What would you call it?
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
He agreed that he was.
What do you think his name is?
That's what he said. Jimmy.
He's still looking, Col.
Persistent.
Good thing in a man.
Maybe he wants something.
He's back, Col
Stop it, Dil --
You see that, Col?
Saw it, Dil.
Fuck it, is what I say.
You fucking promised.
Don't be like that --
Who the fuck is he?
Jimmy.
It's him, isn't it?
Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --
Sure, Dave --
Take your clothes.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Fuck off back to Essex!
Don't chuck my clothes out!
Look, I'm sorry.
Do you mean that?
She's not a tart.
No, of course not, she's a lady.
If I was her I'd consider that an insult.
What's that supposed to mean?
How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
Someone recommend you?
In a way.
Who?
Guy I work with.
Doesn't the water get to your nails?
What's it to you?
You American?
No.
No.
Scottish?
How'd you guess?
The accent, I suppose.
And what's it like?
That should make her happy.
Who's she?
Tell her I'm very happy with it.
Everybody wants something.
You old-fashioned?
What was that?
You all right?
Yes, thank you.
What was that all about?
You know.
You on the game?
He's getting up.
Where?
Give me that look again.
What's that about?
They're jealous.
Why?
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
How special?
Jesus Christ!
Would you like a drink?
What'll it be?
Someone out there.
Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?
Must be in love to manage that.
He lived here with you?
He was different.
As different as it's possible to be.
Tell me about him.
No.
Shouldn't I go?
Yes...
Are you jealous of him?
Maybe.
What do you think?
I think you do.
You say that like a gentleman.
But you can t stay, you know that?
Did he come here too?
Maybe.
He did sometimes.
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
Want to look after you.
What does that mean?
You mean that?
Drink.
Can't leave me now.
The thing is, can you go the distance?
Depends what it is.
What you thinking of, hon?
I'm thinking of your man.
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
Even now.
Dil --
Tell him it hurt --
Come on, Dil --
Don't call me that.
Sorry, darling.
Give it over, Dil --
You could?
Do you care, Jimmy?
Sure I do.
You mean that?
My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
Shut up.
Made me feel all funny inside.
I said stop it.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
You think that's wise?
I didn't mean to hit you.
Kind of liked you as a girl.
That's a start.
So I'm sorry.
Ask to meet me again.
Will you meet me again?
When?
Do they know?
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Details, baby, details.
So they do know.
Don't.
Probably.
Kind of wish I didn't.
You can always pretend.
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
Are you pretending yet?
Am I becoming repetitious?
A little.
Don't ask me in.
Please, Jimmy.
No. Can't pretend that much.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Should have stayed a girl.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
Happy now?
What?
He'd bring me carnations.
So I got it wrong, then.
Not at all, honey.
Don't.
Come on.
Come on.
It's her, isn't it?
Shouldn't be, Dil
She own you, Jimmy?
Yes.
She from Scotland too?
You could say that.
What you doing, Jimmy?
Anything.
You'd do anything for me?
You want another haircut, baby?
You said anything, Dil
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
Why?
It's a secret.
Yes.
And you wouldn't leave me?
No.
You promise?
You want to make me look like him...
So it's true, then?
Don't call me that --
Why?
For me.
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
I'm going home!
Told you to stay in the hotel!
Come on...
I was trying to get out of something.
You mean that?
You heard what I said, Dil?
Prescription. For my condition.
Are you supposed to take that many?
Are you all right, Dil?
Good-bye, Dil
Jimmy?
What?
You knew which man?
Your soldier.
You knew my Jody?
Died...
You killed my Jody?
You killed my Jody
No.
You didn't.
I suppose I tried.
You tried.
Why?
Got to be somewhere.
More endearments.
I like you, DIl
Love me.
Yes.
Tell me you love me.
Then say it.
Love you, Dil.
You do?
Say it again.
And you'll never leave me?
What's Fergus?
It's my name, Dil --
Yes.
Tell me what she wore.
You've got to go now, Dil --
Yes. Now.
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Not if you go.
Will I see you again?
Promise?
I promise.
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
The Metro.
Meet Col --
As the man said, it's in my nature.
Lucky you.
What was it?
You know her, Jimmy?
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
So what do you need, Fergus?
Need to go across the water.
See does he want some.
Hey -- what's he like?
Horny bastard.
Have a look at him.
You don't know that.
Tough work, that.
Leave us, Judie.
I heard.
Eddie and Tinker died.
So you did fuck up.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
No way, Jude. I'm out.
But, then, I don't have a choice.
Och, you do, Fergie.
Of course. I forgot.
And then you'll leave her out of it?
And what if I say no?
You were made for this.
Was I?
Perfect.
And what if you don't?
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
Jude?
Yes?
Who's the old geezer?
You a handyman, Fergie?
I take pride in my work.
Give him a cup of tea.
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
Why would you do that?
Thanks.
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
So he knows your name?
I told him.
Yes.
And do you know why?
Peter.
Why do you want to do that for?
Would make me feel better about it.
You sure about that?
I'm sure.
So it was you all the time.
Who'd you think it was?
And who's Dave when he's at home?
Should blow you away, you know that?
I understand.
Definitely unusual.
And who is she?
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Hope not.
Right.
So it's on the street.
Right.
Fuck you.
Eat something, would you?
What do you mean you can't?
This is a farce, man.
I seen your fucking face.
Am I?
Thank you, handsome.
How did you know it was her?
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.
No?
Nope. Not handsome at all.
You trying to hurt my feelings?
No. It's the truth.
Hey --
Do what?
They won't let him die.
You want to bet?
Why can't we?
Not in your nature.
I'm talking about your people, not you.
Shut the fuck up, would you?
No, what's the funny thing?
Didn't look like that to me...
C'mere.
What?
Don't you think of it, fucker.
She your wife?
You make a nice couple.
Don't I know it.
So what were you fucking around for, then?
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
What the fuck am I doing here.
What the fuck were you doing here?
I got sent.
You could have said no.
Can't. Once I signed up.
And you play cricket?.
Best game in the world.
Best game in the world.
Never.
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
Now, that was worth waiting for.
Hurry up, would you?
Now put it back in.
Shut up, would you?
Fergus?
See? I was right about you.
Don't be so sure.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
We don't look on it like that.
What do you believe in?
That you guys shouldn't be here.
It's as simple as that?
I didn't.
She can't help it.
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
Don't know her.
What?
If they kill me --
I don't know her.
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.
Don't.
Help me.
Go to sleep now.
A story.
Like the one about the frog?
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
When I was a child...
Nothing.
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
Take the hood off, Fergus --
Stop that talk now --
The fastest.
Faster than cricket?
You stupid bastard --
What you say, faster?
I said you bastard -- stop --
Hurling --
What?
What if I did?
You didn't?
And you know what?
Not here.
Who gives a fuck.
I never know nothing.
Come and get me, soldier --
Thought you liked me, bitch.
It was fun while it lasted.
Have you no feelings, woman?
I said shut the fuck up --
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
That fucker's dead --
Give me the shooter, Jude --
You're crazy --
All right -- where's the letter?
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
I could eat a horse.
That's right.
Oh, you should see your face.
What's the matter?
Adam!
You don't look so bad in this light.
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
What is it?
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
Where's that airlines bag?
Lord, you're stubborn.
Let's look anyway.
Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.
I love you, Adam.
Reggie -- I think I've found --  are you on?
I think it only said where -- but I can't --
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
I know, but this is all we've got left.
It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for.
I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
Reggie -- why won't you listen?
But I didn't kill anybody.
Reggie -- please believe me!
Reggie -- listen to me!
You lied to me so many times --
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
You didn't have to chase me so hard --
And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
I said, tell me to go to the --
I heard you, I heard you.
Then say it.
Reggie -- listen to me --
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
You mean spies and things like that?
Only we call them agents.
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Ours.
Oh, I see.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
I believe you.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
Because they're still here.
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
No.
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
Are you sure there's no mistake?
It's Charles!
He looks so young -- when was this taken?
No.
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
Starting with his own.
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
What's your first name today?
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
Yes.
But you're -- divorced?
No.
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
You'd lie about anything.
What now?
How long do you intend -- ?
Sorry about that.
Do I knock or something?
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
Back where?
Then who does?
Me?
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
It's the only name I've got. How about you?
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
Carson Dyle is dead.
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
I left him hanging around the American Express.
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
Would you like to see my passport?
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Yes, but we're divorced.
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
You can't.
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Whitefoot, of course.
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
Why can't you be serious?
Okay.
What are you doing?
Cutting it out.
Who told you to do that?
You did.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
They've got Jean-Louis!
That sounds like their problem.
What day is it?
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
Maybe.
Or Tex?
I think Tex did it.
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
I'd love some, thanks.
Alex --
Hm?
Shut the door!
The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
Fiction or non-fiction?
Why don't you shut up!
Well!
Are you going to listen?
I don't believe it.
Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
How much is it worth?
I'm afraid it is important.
What's its value today?
In money.
Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
And if it is?
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
What do you mean, no?
Mrs. Lampert --
What do you want?
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
You loved him?
He was American?
Swiss.
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
He didn't have one.
I don't know. I suppose so.
About how wealthy would you say?
I don't know.
Where did he keep his money?
I don't know.
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
I don't know.
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
I know.  I'm sorry.
Is it all right?
Is that all? Can I go now?
I don't understand.
I was, too.
In Mr. Dyle's room?
Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
I found it! I found it!
Up there! It is up there!
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?
Why, do you think we're going to?
Quitter.
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
Peter Joshua.
I'm Regina Lampert.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Yes.
Good for you.
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
Please, not on my account.
No, you see, I don't really love him.
Oh. I guess.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Yes, but we're divorced.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Shakespeare never said that.
How do you know?
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Are you in the book?
Charles is.
How did you find out?
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
Where did everything go?
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Come on. You can't stay here.
I don't know where to go.
What's going on?
Don't you understand French?
I'm still having trouble with English.
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
You mean you and me?
En garde.
What are you doing in here?
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
How do you shave in there?
What was it?
What was what?
We're here.
What?
Nothing. Good night.
Peter -- are you all right?
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
Go on.
That's all.
No, they won't -- I won't let them.
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
Who is it?
Yes -- that's right.
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
I believe what he said.
Words can hurt very much.
Don't put yourself out.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
You know what I want, Miz Lampert...
Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
But why do you want a divorce?
Because I don't love him.
He knows everything.
I've never seen him before.
He must have known Charles pretty well.
How can you tell?
Who is it from?
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
I don't see him.
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
Yeah? What's that?
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
I never fucked Rod.
I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
I get all your CDs.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
One more time.
I get the imports.
No.
She's my daughter, Tom.
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
It's almost ten o'clock.
Daddy you scared me!
It won't happen again.
Hi honey.
I want you to head right home after school.
Hi honey.
What do you mean?
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
A little.
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
Not much further.
No honey.
You are upset.
I'm not.
Are you sure?
You know her?
It can't be.
You were eavesdropping.
No I wasn't.
No!
Should we close down any eruption?
Are you sure?
Is Jody still awake?
Well?
She's still a virgin.
What are you doing?
This will relax her.
Hello?
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
St. Michael's.
Of what?
A bullet to the right cerebellum.
Can you get inside?
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
Your brother told us.
We just found another body.
But I shouldn't shut it down?
Pay no attention to me.
You fucked me up!
What?
You gave me a 'D'.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
You aren't going to the party?
of COURSE. You're not scared?
Of course I'm scared.
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
What do you know about my father?
Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?
Go sit next to him.
Who?
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
Oh nice save.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
I promised I'd go right home after school.
Mark invited me to the party.
You can't tell your parents.
Especially not your dad.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
Twenty eight years ago.
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
Don't you think it's sick?
Cut it out.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
Are you O.K.?
I'm fine.
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
You know I want to go with you.
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
They're not picking me up until six.
I'll think about it.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Are you coming to the party?
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
That's not why we broke up.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
Jody. Wait.
What are you doing?
Hi mom.
Hi princess.
Mom?
I need to ask you something.
You can ask me anything.
Lisa Sherman?
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
What?
That's what he said.
Where are you going?
Who is she?
Wait.
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Two men left town right after it happened.
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
The principal?
Yes.
Yes?
Yeah.
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
On what side of the family?
His mother's side.
You ok?
Just thinking about something.
What are you doing?
I got to go.
What?
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
You can have both if you want.
You're so beautiful.
Now don't be nervous.
Ok.
Hide your laptop here.
No.
You can't bring it.
Hey! That was a 3k machine.
I said no.
Maybe it won't stay in.
If sheep don't count.
That wasn't me ...
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
Rod!
You're being unfair.
Unfair?!
Stacy?
Okay, okay.
At least somebody likes this shit.


help me get in the truck. 
 Oh...
...shit.
 Oh, shit.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.

Shit!
...that is going to explode...
...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
Come on, Night Shift.
...-ty.
Where do you want this stuff?
Freezer in the back.
Great. 
That's my business.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
Since when does...
Since today.  New policy.
Well, he told me to collect cash.
Andy.  Another fuckin'...
Except for the fact that I need cash.
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
Oh.
Why don't I--?
Aw!  Oh, Jesus.
Sorry, man.  He's dead.
I need your truck.
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
Peace.
All right.
You want cash?
I got, like, uh....
I got, uh....
...doing?!
I need your truck!
Go on.
Would you hurry up, please?
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you 
What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
That dog was mean before I met him.
That dog ain't mean.
I'm gonna stomp your a--
...up.
Are you kiddin'?

Come on!
Damn.
What the hell's goin' on?
It happens to this piece of shit...
...all the time.
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
 Excuse me...
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?

You'd better coast through...
...town. 
We're clear.
I ain't goin' through Missoula!
Am I missing somethin' here?
Borrowed.
Yeah, borrowed!
You stole this truck.
You stole this truck!
I did not steal this truck!
That's...
...fine.
I ain't playin' that.
 
...-damn!
Ah, one of them's in the back.


You're nuts, goin' back there!
Shut up.
Take your gun!
Doesn't work.
What?
Doesn't...
...work!  It's not even load-...
Oh, shit.



All right.
Okay!  All right!
    Elvis is on ice again.
 Nice job back there.
...gun?!
I was thankin' you, asshole!
Kiss my ass!
 No...
...I'm not the psycho.
Hey, take a look at your situation and...
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
...-cho and a hijack-...
...-er!
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
...you.
You wanna hit me?
And I'm a peaceful man, and...
...I believe in live and...
 Yeah...
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.

Holy shit...
...man!
Oh, shit.
Back up!  Back...
...up!

Come on, old...
...Pete!  Come on!  There it...
...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
Fuck! 

Oh, shit.
  Oh, we're screwed, Night...
I think...
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
...do we?
Oh, shit.
That's right.  Now,  move!


Oh, shit.
 Okay.
Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.
Oh, shit.
Come on, old Pete.
Come on!
Come on, old Pete.
...easy, easy, easy.
Left, left, left!
Get over!  Get over!
Come on.
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
...Pete!  Come on.
Come on, old Pete.  Oh.
I know the likeli-...
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
...Night Shift, but you might...
...wanna give it a try!
Come on, old...
...Pete.  Come on.

Come on.
Come on.
Come on...
Whoo!
Whoo!
I made it!
You okay?
What the fuck was that?!
Shit.  You gotta pass him. 
Gee, you think so?
Holy--!
 Okay.  That didn't work.
 Gee, you think so?
Shut up!
Ho, ho...
 Oh...
...ho!
 ...shit!

 
Hang on!
Hey!


 Shit. 
 Go on.

Come on.
 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.

Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
 Okay.  Okay.

 Aw, shit  

All right, let's go.

Okay.  All right.  Okay. 
 Listen!  Listen...

...you're dealin' with!
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
...man!
He's crazy!
Then stay...
...here!
What?
Come on!

Keep still.
Okay.  Okay.

Oh, shit!
No!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!






Uh-oh.
Okay.
Worth a try.
...did you?
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
...piece of shit was worth.
It won't even start half the time.
So you took his...
 Yeah.
We were nationally  ranked.
Robert Del Rio?
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
We got two paddles.
To tell you the truth, you didn't.
Not completely, anyway.
I mean, if that gun was...
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
...miles.

That is loud!  I'm 
All right, all right.  Hey, hey.
Hey.   Mason.
I think you oughta cut a...
...deal with this asshole.
Even though it is nice to see Andy...
...or my conscience.
A-And you  owe me...
...man.
 
Ow!  


Are you all right?
Listen, Arlo.
They're takin' off.
They're movin'.
Hey, just shut up.
We're gonna die!
Arlo, shut up.
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!
Hey, hey, hey.
What?
Arlo!  Arlo.
Reach into my pocket.

 Come on!
 Okay.
Yeah.
 Okay.

 All right.  Okay.

Okay. 

Arlo!


Okay, here we go.

Come here.
Go, go, go! 

 That's why I didn't give it...
...to him. 
What?
You got Elvis?!
Go!
Stop.

Hang...
...on!
...-ful?!
Oh, fuck!
Oh, shit.
We!
  I've got the real thing!
Here...
...they come!
And Brynner's right on...
...our ass!
Okay...
...here comes the...
...tunnel!
Whoo!
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
What the hell?
What the--?
Stupid.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Shoot me. 
 What's it say? 
Mason.
What?

All right 
Oh.

Come on.  Come on.
What?
 
What?
It's working.



We got-...
...-ta get outta here!
 Vitelli! Vitelli!
 There's gotta be...
Hold this. 

Sorry.
Hang on, hang on.
Let's go!
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
They'll meet you at the top.

Look out.
What'd you come back for?!
Why'd you stay behind?!


 Well.

We're the shit.  Bigtime.
Stop limpin' around like that.
You did help a little.
Who drove the ice cream...
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Who had to put a gun to your head?
Who put the big hurt on...
You, Arlo.
Hello.
Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
Patriotism is its own reward.
I think so too.
 Yeah.
Thank you.
Oh!
Oh, oh!
I feel faint.
 big balls.
Hey.
Hey, be cool.
Be cool.  Be--
That was quick.
We're worried...
...about him.
...within five minutes.

Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
This country trained me to kill...
...without compunction.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?

And it won't be pleasant. 
Vaughn.

Well, that just about figures for today.
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
Yeah, that's my truck.
Mason, you have to take this...
...take my sorry old truck.
I had no idea how powerful it was.
 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
...here.   Mason... 
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
What?  Say again...
 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
We've got it...
...owe you.
We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
...including the permanently extreme.



Whoo-hoo! 

Is it--?
They were all wearing hardware.
Any of them Richard Long?
Doc-...
...to be off the island tonight.
And I changed the schedule.
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work...
Now, I know.  You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
"I am become Death, the...
...destroyer of worlds."
No!
No!


Is this stool taken?
No, go--
You look good, Richard.
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
...and the government.
Grateful?
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
Went away? 
"Went away."  I like that.
And let me guess.  You failed.

Do you know what'll...
...happen if I drop this?
Brynner.
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
Pleasant surprise.
I can't say it's a surprise.
I checked your release date.  I never liked coincidences.
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
I'll do it.
 There's nothing in here, sir.  They got away with it.

 Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.
...comes up that road.
Well.  It appears someone's been lying to us.

Radio the bikes.
And so Missoula's prodigal son returns.
Of which we have more than enough.
Carl!  Set up the camera.
Hit him.
Hit him again.


Vaughn.
Check the immediate area.
This was supposed to be a...
Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready.
Dennis!
Get your links set up!
I wanna patch in from...
...here!
What about these two?
I'm on it.
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here.
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
I'm Colonel Brynner, U.S. Special Operations Com-...
...-mand out of Fort Bragg.
We were called in by the Jerome base...
...-ty.
Right.  Tim Mason.
...general store.
Richard Long.
Where's their protective...
...gear?
Mornin'.
Is this your establishment?
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
I assume you want that to go.
...dangerous.
Quite a getup for jacking...
...deer.
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.
I assume you have one.
Doc...
...time to time, yeah.
Not tonight...
...though.
Odd, then, that his car...
...should be right outside.
Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...
I want you to look at one another...
...and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared...
...to die for a country that's...
I don't see my container.
You try anything, it goes in...
...-tainer!
Where's Arlo?

...and unharmed, de-...
...-spite the mouth.



 






No.
Where's Elvis?!
Dead, last time I...
 ...checked. 







Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?
Oh.  Well, I have got to get to the dentist be-...
I can handle it.
Yeah?
Be sure you feed Bosco.
 Two pots of coffee...
...ready before the morning crowd blows in.
Oh, you're two of a kind, doc.  Oh, he may not have your sheepskins, and...
...somehow. 
There's something else too.
Secrets.
You got thirty minutes.
It's after five...
Rangers.
Go.
Geneva just pulled the plug.
Kabula's out.
Hit it...
...now!
No sign of 'em...
Forty-nine?
Major, we've gotta seal that tunnel!  Major!
...tight!
Colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy?

What's going on, colonel?
 ...that tunnel.
Is Elvis out?
That little geek is my...
...son.
And where are you going?
...-five.
Who's your suspect?
A man named Tim Ma-...
Mason?  No, he's a soda-jerk drifter, a hamburger flipper.
Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?

Hey, doc.  Might wanna...
...try this one out some-...
...-time. 
Excellent.
...like a fish.
 No, that's not possible, Mason.  The trout... 
...is a perfect hunter.
He's brains without ambition...
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
...back...
...and that power...
...-to a simple thing like...
...fishin'.

Mason.
Shit!  Oh, shit. 
Call an ambulance.
The compound has to be kept cold...
 ...or it'll ignite. 
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
You're the only one I can trust.
...-m-means, Mason.  
Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
And only then does our noble friend realize...
...that the prey can bite back.
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
 ...miles. 
...you, Mason?
What?  Say again, Ma-...
We've got the real thing!
...Mason?
...tunnel!
Mason.  Mason!
There's a vent shaft leading straight up.
So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
Do you recognize this young man?
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
...-lem?
...you answer mine.
Got that?
So you don't remember...
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
...seriously.
...public drunkenness....
Shut your mouth until I tell you...
Let me see your...
...hands!
I said let me see your hands now!
You redneck idiot, do you have...

 Listen, Pappas...
...there's a colonel...
...on the other end of this phone.
...side!
...tunnel now!
Don't move!
What the hell was that?
The Army, sealin' us in.
  All right.
I'll lead 'em out.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
All right, go.
Okay, doc.
Get in 



Gimme this god-...
...-damn phone.
 Talk to me.


Oh.
Do it now.
I'll stay here and secure this position.
It's too late, Mason. I've...
...gotta seal it.
Negative.  Negative.
 There's ammo fire from Brynner's vehicle.
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
Look at that.
'Course you do, Jake.
I'll settle for L.A. County.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
Then these are all new owners?
If that's what it says.
Sir?
How did she get that idea?
Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
Tell me. What do the police say?
Who's the investigating officer?
Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.
Do you know him?
Oh yes.
We worked in Chinatown together.
Very.
None.
That's too bad.
His girlfriend?
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
No. She's probably scared to death.
No.
My daughter.
Avocado groves?
I've got her.
Is she all right?
Where is she?
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
What does this mean?
How much are you worth?
I have no idea. How much do you want?
You've got her? Where?
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
Of course I do. Where are you?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
Either that or she'll be in jail.
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
What's that, Curly?
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.
Call me Jake. How is everything?
Sure thing.
Curly, where's your car?
In the garage.
Where's that?
Off the alley.
Sure, as soon as we eat.
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
I'll just tell my wife.
Plus what I owe you?
I'll throw that in too.
You sure this is okay?
Okay.
That's a filthy habit.
That's just lovely.
Where did you get this material?
Hello, Jake.
Summer colds are the worst.
Thanks, Lou.
How'd you get past the guards?
Since when?
Looking for someone.
Who?
Oh yes.
I'd like to talk to him.
No.
Or her name?
I don't want it anymore.
No?
No. It was an accident.
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
What are you doing here?
I don't.
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
You accusing me of extortion?
It's too late.
Too late for what?
I know what he says.
Matter of fact I do.
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
That's it?
Well, let's go.
You never learn, do you, Gittes?
I guess not.
Give you three minutes.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
A complete surprise?
A private investigator?
Mr. Gittes.
Would you like something to drink?
What are you having?
Iced tea.
What?
Mrs. Mulwray?
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
What do you mean?
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
No. I went riding rather early.
I'll stop by.
Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
...Just a minute...
You left your keys in the ignition.
I got your check in the mall.
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
How did you find out?
My husband.
Unless what?
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
Did you have affairs?
Mr. Gittes.
Is there anything else you want to know?
Where you were when your husband died.
I can't tell you.
You mean you don't know where you were?
I mean I can't tell you.
K... Cross.
That your maiden name?
Yes... why?
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
No, not for that one.
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Another satisfied client?
Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
You sure shout that?
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Know him?
We got it. We got it, baby.
I'll stay.
Maid's night off?
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
I gave everybody the night off.
Easy, it's an innocent question.
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
When was the last time?
It was in Chinatown.
What were you doing there?
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
You can't always tell what's going on there.
Your eye.
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
...A flaw...
Where?
Just... I have to.
The Albacore Club.
I know.
He owns it. You know?
I saw him.
You saw my fa... father? When?
This morning.
You didn't tell me.
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
It's possible.
Okay, give me the keys.
I am not!
She's too upset.
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
Aren't you coming back with me?
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
Did you get some sleep?
Where's the girl?
Upstairs. Why?
What did you do that for?
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
Katherine.
Katherine?... Katherine who?
I said the truth!
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
I'll take care of it.
Where can we go?
...where does Kyo live?
How do you know?
Let me handle that.
I'm all right.
Walsh here?
But, Mr. Gittes.
Sophie.
Sophie.
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
I think I got something.
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
The obituary column?
You'll find one of those people.
Yeah, Sophie.
A Miss Sessions calling.
Who?
Ida Sessions.
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
There's just one question.
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
And Mulwray isn't?
I'm sorry, I --
I never was.
I said, the northwest valley.
Mr. Gittes?
Yes?
Do you know me?
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Have we ever met?
Well, no.
Never?
Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
The water.
What about the water?
When it comes.
That's a long fall.
Yeah.
The L.A. River?
It's bone dry, Morty.
Gittes?... Gittes?
Yeah?... I do?
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
No, really?
I'm afraid so.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
...Yes of course.
All right, what's your husband's first name?
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
No problem with me on the Job.
Mr. Mulwray, please.
He's not in, Mr.?
May I ask what this is regarding?
Since lunch.
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
Yes. No.
He did or he didn't?
He owned the water department?
They were partners.
Apple core?
Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.
All she needed for that was the phone book!
No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
So he says you sent them?
Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?
I'm working for his daughter.
That right?... She used to be some looker.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
Course, she settled down nicely.
Well, you never know, do you?
That's for sure.
Why'd she run away?
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
You understand which side the gelatin's on?
Will they really find work in Germany?
Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
Now what can you see?
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult.
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
You weren't expecting me?
You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. .
Did you ever see her again? 
You understand now? You see it clearly?
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
Hi, Elena!
Hi. Why are you running?
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
We'll talk about that later.
I don't care. I'll wait.
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
My husband...you know him.
No...
Then where's the money?
Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
He sure did, Mr. Kane.
Mr. Kane -
Go on!
I didn't see that.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
I can't take shorthand.
This is all figured at three cents a copy.
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
Go in and ask him to hurry.
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
Enthusiastic?
Yes, very!  Naturally.
Who else you been to see?
You know why?  She was so -
Sure, sure.
I'm going back there.
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.
Sixty-two thousand -
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Do you, Mr. Leland?
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Hello, Mr. Leland.
Mr. Kane is finishing it.
Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter.
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
My little sanctum is at your disposal. But I don't think I understand -
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
And the notice?
Yes - Mr. Kane.
Is it good?
It isn't finished?
No, Mr. Kane.
That's Leland, isn't it?
Yes, Mr. Kane.
We haven't heard from him.
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
Hello, Brad -
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -
Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here.
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
It can wait.
What's this all about, Emily?  I've had a very tiring day and -
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
Get out, both of you!
Ow!
What's the matter with you?
Toothache.
I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
Where's the soap?
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
Where's the towel?
On the chiffonier.  Here.
A chicken?
No.  But you're close.
How old did you say you were?
I work at Seligman's.
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
Would you sing for me?
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Charlie!  I said, what time is it?
Half past eleven.
I mean in New York.
Half past eleven.
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
Susan, it seems to me -
Don't tell me you're sorry.
I'm not sorry.
No, you're not.
I won't let you go.
Get Dr. Corey.
Close the door, Raymond.
Yes, sir. 
Raymond - 
Do you like poetry, Raymond?
Can't say, sir.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Oh, yes, sir.
Do you know what that is?
It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
Tired?
It's been a tough day.
Charlie -
Charlie -
Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
I've got to think of Emily -
First of all - 
What's wrong, Brad?
I'm drunk.
I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
Oh, yes, the bonus.
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
Well, let's hope it's all for the best.
Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid needs is a good thrashing!
It's a letter from her lawyers.
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
Rawlston is my boss.
Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
Thompson!
That's the whole works, right up to date.
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
Yes and no.
You can go on asking questions if you want to.
The banks are out of luck, eh?
How did you meet him?
What did you get?
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
Right away.  Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
Am I sure about what?
Are you serious?
How long have you been smoking?
I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am I right?
You're shittin' me.
Pack of cigarettes.  What's that?
Thanks. Have a good one.
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
I take it she likes the guy.
She said not to come home until graduation.
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
Can I watch?
You can hold me down.
Dick.
Exactly.
God, isn't he great?
No, this is great.
Can I use the bathroom?
There's no light back there.
Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
I was here the whole time.
Nobody! I swear!
Why?
When did you get back?
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
Train. It took eight hours.
You saw it?
Very dramatic, I thought.
And you said yes?
So you're really getting married?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
Sang? His name is a past tense?
I just told you.
There's more, isn't there?
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
But can we date?
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
You're serious. You want to date again.
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
Let me take you out tonight.
You mean, on a date?
What about Sing?
Sang.
Sang.
He's not invited.
So what are you saying?
You're such an asshole.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
How'd you get here so fast?
I left like an hour ago.
It wasn't me.
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
Stop this. This isn't funny.
I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
Are you sure somebody was back there?
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
We did.
Then who operated the store?
Nobody. It was closed.
Are you open?
Yeah.
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
If you can just wait a few more minutes.
I can pass!
Like you're better!
Are you open?
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
Pack of cigarettes.
Cute cat. What's his name.
You open?
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
You only brought one ball?!
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
Why are the shutters closed?
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
Bunch of savages in this town.
What time do you have to stay till?
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
What smells like shoe polish?
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
You don't want to know.
You called Caitlin again?
She called me.
Eight and a half.
She called you Brad?
That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
Oh, my God.
Great story, isn't it?
Your mother.
Allan Harris.
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
I'm talking to myself here.
Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
All four?
You know what I just watched?
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
Empire.
What's that?
All right, Vader's boss...
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
Wait.
Perfect dozen.
Each egg has to be perfect.
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.
Let's hear it.
The milkmaids.
Which ones?
No.
Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
Vermont?
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
FUCK!
Why'd you apologize?
You know what pisses me off the most?
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
I'm going to miss the game.
Don't yell at me, pal.
Sorry.
See? There you go again.
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
At least we're stuck here together.
He's blunt, but he's got a point.
Design major.
Are you gonna lock the store?
I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
We're not playing in the street.
You know what Sanford told me? 
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
Julie Dwyer died.
Yeah, right.
How? When?
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
You've had sex with a dead person.
I'm gonna go to her wake.
No, you're not.
It's today.
Shit. What about tomorrow?
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
I'm going with you.
She was pretty young, hunhh?
Twenty-two; same as us.
An embolism in a pool.
An embarrassing way to die.
How'd he die?
Broke his neck.
Shut the hell up.
Bible truth.
Stop it.
I swear.
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
His dick was in his mouth?
Balls resting on his lips.
He made it, hunhh?
I could never reach.
Reach what?
You know.
I can't fucking believe you!!
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
Let me borrow your car.
Fine. Just lend me your car.
Why should I loan you my car?
I want to rent a movie.
What's that for?
Let me borrow your car.
May I be blunt with you?
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
Please, get the hell out of here.
Get to work.
I like to expand my horizons.
No way!
Five hundred dollars.
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
I don't; you did.
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
Then how come you got the fine?
Because I'm here.
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
Because I'm happy.
You're happy?
I'm happy.
You're happy to get a fine?
Now I know you're lying.
I'm not. She just left.
You're kidding.
I'm not.
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
Watch the store while I go home and change.
What happened to title dictates behavior?
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
You just fucked a total stranger?
Around three or something.
This life.
This life?
Why do I have this life?
You should shit or get off the pot.
I should shit or get off the pot.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
It's the same thing with Veronica.
Who're you kidding? You can so.
You still didn't have to choke me.
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
Why do you say that?
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
How do you figure?
To talk to you.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
It's not like I'm miles away.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
You need a ride?
Do you work tomorrow?
Helluva day.
Are you open?
Yes.
Just the paper.
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
He's got those love handles.
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
I'm her sister.
They are not.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
I am not.
How much can you bench?
Did you say Caitlin Bree?
How do you know that?
No, she's getting married.
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
Are there any balls down there?!
Go open the video store.
I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
You used to go out with her?
We were going to start again, I think.
I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
You calling me a liar?
Be careful.
And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
No, he got hit by a bus.
Oh... Can I help you?
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
At least they weren't lit.
I hate this fucking place.
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
You're kidding.
You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
Hunhh? Nothing.
What were you doing?
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
You're trusting.
Ooh! Can we?!
Really?
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
Typically male point of view.
And I actually date you?
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
How many?
How many what?
How many girls have you slept with?
What the hell was that for?
You're a pig.
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
Three.
Three?
You've only had sex with three different people?
Who?
No; who were the three, besides me?
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
Shit! Why are we getting up?
He requested this?
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Why do you say that?
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
Yeah, right.
You sucked that guy's dick?
That's because I never had sex with him!
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
Please calm down.
How many?
How many dicks have you sucked?!
Let it go...
Well...?
Something like thirty-six.
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Um. Thirty-seven.
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
I'm going to class.
No, but you sucked enough dick!
I feel sick.
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
What did he say?
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
...it isn't there. Yes.
Thank you for being rational.
Thank you for the lasagne.
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
Veronica, I love you...
You hold the counter and I'll pull.
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
You open?
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
Can I have your name please?
Here you go.
What's this?
I didn't do that!
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
He's your cousin?
No way!
What did he say?
That doesn't sound metal.
Did he say "making fuck?"
Come on, man, "Berserker!"
Does he sing in English or Russian?
I do about three-fifty, four.
No way!
Feel that.
Sure. How about the beach?
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
No, I wasn't.
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
I beg your pardon!
I hope it feels good.
You'll be missed.
That's the price, my brother.
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
How long you gonna be here?
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
You're gonna be at John K's party?
I'm not sad.
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
The guy ain't here yet.
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
I know. I've been here since eleven.
I have first dibs.
Twenty bucks?
Twenty bucks.
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
Bye. 
Gabe!  Hey, man!  Gabe!  It's Gabe!
Work!  Don't say that word, man.
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
Answer the man.
C-4?
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
Jessie, Hal, come in...please report.  Over.
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.
So, what do you see?
Surprise me.
What usually eats a banana?
Copy.  Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
Where are you, Walker?
The money!
Glad you could drop in.
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
What the hell are you doing here?!
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
There wasn't time for anything else.
We'll never know, will we?
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
What are we going to do?
I'm going with you.
Not on that leg.
Room service...Hi, Sarah.
How're ya feeling?
She's tough.
There you go.
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
Help me!  I don't want to die!
Do you see them yet?
Patience my love, patience.
You can stop right there.
I know...
I don't expect you to understand.
I don't understand?
Why are you yelling?
Excuse me?
Why are you yelling?
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
Which could maybe what?
Maybe lead to a flare up...
A flare up...
Listen to you...  The old "mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation routine, huh?
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
He can handle it.
Gabe!?
You got to go back now!
Let's be creative.
What about you?
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
Remember the first time we came up here?
Of course I do.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
We have to get through to the other side.  You up for it?
A simple yes or no would have done.
Want me to lead?
Nice view, huh?
Gabe!  Are you alright?
No luck?
Pull it apart!
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
Never, what?!
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Frank!  No, Frank!  Frank!
Reach up!  Do it!
Don't let me fall!
We were going together before I ever let go of you.
I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?
Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
What do you think?  Maybe I could reach the ledge without falling. No, forget it.
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
We don't have time to argue about it!
Take the rope.
I won't do it.  No way.
Wrap it around that rock twice.
Forget it!  I refuse!
What about you?!
There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
Never could save a thing.
Where's the helicopter?
It's up there, on the Tower.
He never hurt anybody.
Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
Yeah...
What's your names?
Tucker and Walker.
On top of the peak.
Then where the fuck is!
Go after her.
Who's going with you?
You're looking at him.
Right.
What the hell are you doing--
Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
Why?  What are you going to do?!
Don't use my name!
Ask the questions.
Where's the third one, Travers?
I don't trust him.
Man against nature, right Travers.
This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
You got what we need?
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
Rich...
I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
Hello Lucy, had a busy night? Puts money in machine.
Been punished, yeah?
Good evening, sir.
Of course. Food alright?
Won't you join me, sir?
No, my health doesn't allow it.
Thank you, sir.
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
Yes. They want to help.
Help me, sir?
Help you.
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
Hi, hi, hi there, at last we meet.
So this is the young man?
How do you do, sir?
Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
Much better, thank you, sir.
What would you like to know, sir?
Well, shall we get down to it?
Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I swear it.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
Who said that?
I did, sir.
What crime did you commit.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
Good evening, my boy.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
Keeping fit then?
Fine, fine.
Well - I'm back.
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
What do I want?
I'm gonna be sick.
You're gonna be sick are you?
I wanna be sick.
You wanna be sick?
Alexander de Large, sir.
Crime?
Religion?
C of E, sir.
Do you mean Church of England?
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
Brown hair, is it?
Fair hair, sir.
Blue eyes?
Blue eyes, yes, sir.
Are you an Epileptic?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Crabs?
No, sir.
Lice?
No, sir.
Through there for a bath.
You're absolutely right, sir.
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
You mean like going to the pictures?
Yes!!!
You've heard Beethoven before?
How are you feeling today?
Fine. Fine.
I haven't seen you before.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
Yes.
Good. I'm glad
And when do I get out of here then?
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
Father, I have tried, have I not?
You have, my son.
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
One pair of trousers - blue pinstriped.
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Carry on, Chief.
Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?
Hullo, son, how are you?
How many to a cell?
Shall we go to my office?
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
But Bowery's fine, if that's what you want.
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
The ride is free.
Go ahead, say it.
No.  I got lucky with the lights.
Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
No?  How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
Like what?
You like being a lawyer?
Big case?
Most of the time.
You need a vacation.
How often you go?
Annie...it's Max.
Max...
Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...
...he's two floors below you.
Where are you, what floor?
Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
This your current address?
You dizzy?  You want to sit down?
I'm...fine.  Fine.
You're kidding me.
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.
No.
Oh, my, yes.
You know Dmitri?
How do I know you'll keep your word?
It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
I'm sorry.
Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?
Vincent.  Do not cross me.
What are you gonna do?
You guys been holding hands?
So?  It was a random thing.
I never bought that.
Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.
What if they're wrong?
Not our call, Phil.
...if they're wrong?!
I was with Max when he got the call.
Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.
Quite an achievement...
What's your name?
Try?
Hi, Ma.
I've been calling and calling.
I brought you flowers.
What's he sayin'?
I'm standing right here.
I came to see you, you look fine.  We gotta go.
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!
He's not paying you one cent!
I was just tryin' to...to...
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
You hassling my driver again?
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
He'll keep calling.
...oh, bullshit!  He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
Hello?
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?
How long you think this'll take?
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
You on some kind of work plan?
You mean like benefits?
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
It's not that kind of job.
You should start a union.
Me, specifically?
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
You cool, Max?  Say "I'm cool."
You're cool.
No.  You say you're cool.
Good.  Help me out here.
I don't think I can do this.
Got it?
His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
You listening to me?
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
What about that?
I tried it.
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
Try some deep breathing.
What are you doing?
It's a mess.
58th and Central.  You know it?
South Central.
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
Are you breathing?
Music.
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
Get rid of 'em.
I can't believe this.
I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them.
That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant...
Who's that?
It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
So what?
I need the job.
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
Collateral damage.
Vincent?
Yes, Max?
I'm...what?  Sorry?
Jazz.  Music.
Let him go, Vincent.
Let's go.
No.
What you mean, no?
Max?  What are you doing?
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
Show up for what?
Show up for <u>what?</u>
You go every night?
Mom, Vincent's not interested.
You take one more step, I'll kill her.
What the fuck was <u>that?</u>
Limos, huh?
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
What, no insurance?
Doesn't cover everything.
Gimme your wallet.
The man who hired me for this contract.
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
Why?
In case he asks.
You get benefits?
No.
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
Would you have called her?
You had to kill Heller?!
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
No, not just that.
Yeah, that.
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
Some living.
Head towards Union Station.
One more.
That's what you said...
Then what are you?
What happened to you?
Slow down!
Well.  That was brilliant.
Max?
They said send you downstairs.
The sound of love.
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
I never told her.
Why the hell not?
Are you crazy?!
The guy came right at us!
I was only going one way.
Drop me off here!
Look, I'm sorry --
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
Mississippi?
Saved you last night's, too.
Do you still ride?
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
You going to warn him?
I can't promise you anything.
You think I'm crazy.
I bit the bastard's nose off.
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
What's the charge?
Switch the charts.
What is?
People do have heart attacks.
For what?
He says a dog bit his nose.
Arf... You gotta help me.
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Them who?
Flat, wraparound headlights?
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
That's it?
If my universe had a hub...
I've been reading up on it.
Pretty scary, huh?
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
What are you doing?
Uh huh.
Has this happened to you before?
Never, but I've been practicing.
So what's the question?
Is this your dad?
That was him.
Please put it down.
He's why you punish yourself.
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
Murdered?
Okay, I will.
You will?
If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
You look great.
We're going to Queens?
Where are we going, Jerry?
Connecticut.
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
My father's house.
Liza?
Did you kill him?
Is that what they told you?
He gave it to me.
I don't understand.
Where were you the day he died?
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
I believe you.
They'll trace it.
Blue moon... Blue moon...
Blue moon...
Without a song in my heart.
Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?
I love you, too.
Do I know you?
I'm a very patient man.
Liza Sutton is dead.
Thank you.
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
You made your decision yet?
I'll do it.  On one condition.  I want to make sure she's okay.
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
I don't know...
Can I ask you something?
A dog bit it.
So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
And you have no idea where he lives?
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
Jerry told me he bit your nose.
<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
I'm still listening.
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
Where'd you get it?
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
It's okay.  I'm game.
So, you doing anything tonight?
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
Working.
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
Liza, settle a bet for us.
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
Ah, your psychotic is here.
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
Which way did he go?
Agent Lowry.
Wasn't my idea.
Can I talk to you a second?
Do you believe me?
Yeah, I do.
I want to believe you, too.
Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
Where do you think Jerry is?
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
What do you suggest?
That you come with me.
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
There's no plug to pull.
Yes, sir.
He died...  ... in 1972.
Dr. Arroway --
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
What in the hell...?
Now I remember why I went into theoretical work.  Kent.
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
Pepsi?  Tequila?
Peter sends his regards.
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
No doubt.
You can't just pull the plug, David.
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
Throw a gray scale on it; standard interpolation.
What is it?  What's happened?
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
David --
Ellie.
Do you have a minute -- ?
You aren't staying?
This... seemed best.
Right.  Well.
What would you have me say, David?
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
There's no way of knowing.  Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never.
And?
No primer.
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
That can't be right; it's only twenty-six light years away.
Here, right around Centaurus A.
Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up the starfield signal origin.
Can't we get rid of them?
-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
And a hundred mile airspace.
Please answer the question, Doctor.
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Talk to him.
But what do I say?
Could we hear to the moon?
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
You're not real.  None of this is.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years.
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
Am I one... or many?
So.  What happens now?
Now... you go home.
It's time to go home now.
A page-break signal.  A period.
It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
Hokkaido Island.
The systems integration site.
Ellie.  Arroway.
Peter Valerian.
Sounds like a Russian general.
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
Actually --
We could be together again --
-- I'm moving to Washington.
Ellie --
Ellie.
It's good to see you, Ellie.
Someone tell me this is really happening.
It's really happening.
That you, Valerian?
Like it or not.
Wait -- hold on a minute --
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
Champagne please.
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
Did you love him?
Yes.  Very much.
So.  Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
Maybe you're creating a monster.
It's getting late...
So.  The final countdown.
What...?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry -- I can't --
What?
I can't do this --
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
Hi.
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
I'm not sure it's come to that.
They don't believe me.
Git your shovel and git to work.
Git movin', I said.
But I made this arrangement --
You don't take another man's place, boy.
I'll make it a dollar.
Yeah, well, Arletta, you done your best. What I done with myself is my problem.
Yeah.
What are you doin' here?
Here, Mom.
What went wrong?
I'm leavin' the place to John.
Gotta go, Arletta.
Tell us about it.
A salesman! Cool Hand Luke a salesman?
Comin' out here, Boss?
What's all this dirt in the yard?
Please! Please!
You got your mind right, Luke?
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.
Go git it, Luke.
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
Here's the Patrol.
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
You can't do that!
Borrowin' or payin' back?
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
Whatcha got?
Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
So then you just call him.
But there's still daylight left.
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
What happened? How far did you get?
Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...
Lemme see it!
Dragline, lemme look at the picture.
That's my baby.
Somebody say somethin'?
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Well, whatta we got here?
Whatta you so happy about?
Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard road finally got to Mister Lucas War Hero.
Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
Whatta you mean, forget it?
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
Where'd the road go?
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
Sure do... that's why we didn't bet with the Navy.
Take it easy, Drag.
Luke. Where you goin?
Like I always do?
Dragline gives out the names here. You'll get yours when he figures you out.
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
You just said he could eat anything.
Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
Oh Lord!
That fool. That damn fool.
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
Man, it's so hot.
Cuter again.
Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least.
Kick a buck.
Back a buck.
Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.
You think you've been working hard. This muther'll break your back.
He'll never make it.
He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.
No. No chains either.
I hate this...
It's good medicine.
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
Oh God.  I'm really crazy.
When was the last time you washed your hair?
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
The moon is up, my night to howl. Will you be okay?
You bastard!
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
What pattern was that?
What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
When was that?
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
The door was already open...
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
She's supposed to have it.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
You know I can't do that.
For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
You know where.
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
Who is this?
I think this is number three...
Is he out?
If he's not out, why are they here?
Because of your phone calls.
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
Is it an ongoing case?
How do you know that?
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
We've got another one.
That's no surprise.
But it's a different m.o.
I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
Ruben.
There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
Why should I trust you?
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
That computer's wired into INTERNET.
I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest of it?
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
Are you always so bold?
Tell me what to do!
Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!
The lock...
It's a woman shot in a car?
Yes.  I have to go...
Don't hang up!
Open the door.  Please.
Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
Who came in after you?
What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
Because it's your job, that's all.
It's none of my business anymore...
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
Well, you outranked <u>me</u>, Nikko.
I heard. Good police work.
Just horseshit luck.
Snotty neurotic bitch...
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
Honest to God, Ruben!
You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...
Absolutely.
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...
I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
You messed with the scene.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
How about I put Nikko on it?
Where you going?
What the hell you need her for?
You got a suspect...
How'd you get in on the deal?
Give me Ruben back...
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
There, that's better.
Where's the car?
Outside in the visitors, car park.
It's about time.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
It does.
Do you find him attractive?
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
I thought that was you, up there.
One of your suitors?
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
I'd like to go back. James...
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
You haven't told me where we're going.
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
So - why the airport?
Yes.
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
Can you drive?
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
Crash victim?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
I did this already.
I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
Patient.
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
The question, Letty, is how are you feeling?
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
Then, you should call.
It was just a little going-away gesture.
What's up with you?
Just go ahead and tell us.
She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
And the party?
Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
What do you think of this one?
Things have been kind of stressful lately.
Yeah, everything's under control.
What about the engagement party?
What about this one?
Fuck me.
What's all the dreck?
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.
What do you think?
Do we have to talk wedding details?
What's his name, Letty?
You did the right thing.
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Will you get time off to do that?
My goodness. A wedding.      My goodness.
Tell us every detail.
I gather he's late as usual.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
Yes.
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
I haven't had a crush since I was
I'm only looking out for you.
Must you walk so quickly?
Honestly, Letty.
Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?
Letty, you should be in bed.
Green spot.
To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
You can only do what feels best to you now.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
Chair, cup and ball.
By color.
A while, I guess.
Hey there. They're showing "Groundhog Day" if you...
You took bets on my diagnosis?
Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
What are you looking to read?
But you're checking it out.
John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
He asked me to marry him.
Very romantic setting.
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
Guess which hand.
Enough with the abracadabra.
Guess.
Really, this isn't funny.
Good God.
We're supposed to be asleep.
We'll get caught.
Don't be ridiculous.
A daisy for the lady.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
Thanks.    Where've you been all day?
I'm not allowed to see you anymore.
Wow.    I'm bad news.
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
I wish I could have seen that.
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
I have a terrible confession.
Tell the doctor.
Then it's over.
It's a good thing my family loves you.
Do you?
I do.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
Well?
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
So there were no problems?
Not a one.
Yeah.
I better make a list.
This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
Wow.
You've got to see the kitchen first.
Do you like it?
I love your apartment.
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
Hey.
Michael.
Not yet.
Good luck.
Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
Sounds grim.
Who ever said sanity was fun?
The store was busy.
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
Are you OK?
Four interviews. Four no-gos.
The restaurant, too?
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
How may I help you?
Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
Aunt Lily?
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
What is it? Are you OK?
Always the drugs.
I saw you talking to my Mom.
Silly?   Silly am I?
Michael, take it easy.
Silly, silly, silly.
Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.
I guess we need to talk.
I guess so.
I sure know what that feels like.
And all the plans we have.
Well then why'd it happen?
I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
What are we going to do?
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
I guess I should go now.
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
Can I put these here for tonight?
Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter.
My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
I don't feel like going to work today.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
What are you doing?
Can you loan me a 20?
Sure. Why?
I'm going to the store.
It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
Are you all right?
That's a big question.
I hope it wasn't something I did.
Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?
Especially this last year.
Especially now.
I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
No, you've done a perfect job.
No, no.
What's so urgent?   You've got me worried.
I've met someone else.
Who?
It doesn't matter who.
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
Getting back.
I heard about your friend.
I think I've heard this speech before.
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
All tapped out.
How's it look?
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa.
Agent Hadley.
Do you know who this is?
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Zero.   That's all I know.
Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
Too many people know about my involvement in this.
Not today.   Where are your friends?
They left about a half hour ago.
Where did they go?
Hey man, you can't do that!
Hello?
It's Elvis...
Who?
You're there now?
My number's going to show up on his bill!
You've already robbed the safe?
Hello?
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
Good.   I'm good.
-- Super what?
Okay.   How much?
I'm not here to negotiate.
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
They're gonna be what?
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
I guess we're going to find out.
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
Half the tapes.
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
Thank you.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
Yeah.   We just go home.
Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
Because you're the closest.
Why is everything an argument with you?
Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!
Hopefully no one.
I just want you there in case there's trouble.
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
You want Zero to kill him?
I'm going to kill him myself!
Bring me the scissors.
Turn on the flashlight.
You didn't buy batteries?
I thought they came with batteries.
That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
No.
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
We still have to get out of here.
Good idea.
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
All right, knock it off.
Hadley --
It's not your fault, Daniel.
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
Anybody hungry?
What'd you get?
What?
I will.
What do you want now?
Guns.   Can you get them?
Man, I can get anything.
How much?
A thousand dollars?
Yeah?
I just thought that--
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
They were all French guys.
French guys?    You mean like from France?
Yeah, French guys from France.
What'd they take?
Everything.
Everything?
Everything.
Just find them!
Good song though.
The Holiday Hotel.
What room number?
I don't know.     I didn't look.
I was told to take what we have and go.
They don't have a wine list.
No, I didn't.
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
They don't serve wine here.
This kind.
We've got to get out of here.
I'll drive.
I'm the driver.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
I'm not going to leave you.
What the hell is he talking about?
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
No.   How much?
Today's your lucky day, Sami.
You lived there. You know the city.
-- I want to be Elvis.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
Mr. Taylor?
No.
Give it to me, Sami.
Get in the car.
What happened?
Yeah.   It's mine.
No.   It's mine.
Fuck you, grease-ball!
Mr. Zammito?
I don't know what you're talking about.
How?
I am Raymond.     Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
How are we going to do that?
I think we went the wrong way.
Holy shit.
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
Glenmorangie.
Algeria.
I can't even hear myself think.
What does arresting us get them?
And how do we do that?
When do we go?
You ever hear of jet lag?
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
Something like that.
Did she break your heart?
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
Who's gonna see it there?
Can't sleep?
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
Who are you waiting for?
Why?
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
Okay.    Okay.
How's the arm?  Still sore?
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
She's crazy.  You should have killed her.
I didn't have the heart.
I don't care about your sword.
Yes.
Where's your master?
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
On guard!
Why do you want to teach me?
I'm just playing around.
Tell me, who is your master?
I'll never live as a thief!
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
I owe you nothing.
You don't seem to understand.
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
Put them down.
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
This spells trouble.
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
You're too young to understand.
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
You're not married, are you?
I've missed you.
How so?
You're doing calligraphy?
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
Here you must be in proper attire.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
Come and get it if you can.
Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.
Not another lecture!  On guard!
Let's end this here.
What do you want?
Give it back!
Kneel!
Lo?
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
Give me back my comb.
I don't take orders from anyone.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
Let them look.
Go.
Jen...
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Mu Bai...It's been too long.
It has.  How's business?
Good.  And how are you?
I left the training early.
Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
The Green Destiny Sword?  You're giving it to Sir Te?
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu.
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
Have you questioned him yet?
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
Then, why did you come?
I knew she would intrigue you.
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
Shu Lien...
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  She's being so considerate.
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
It's Jade Fox!
They're gone.
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
And you're gonna tell me who.
Talent. Hi.
Care for a hot dog?
You buying?
No onions?
Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file?
Well, hello there...chocolate,
Don't thank me.
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
My name.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
Thank you.  For giving a damn.
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
It's only a flesh wound.
They couldn't do anything for me.
How 'bout the morgue?
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
At least it finally stopped raining.
Who?
Mister Funboy.
I can pick out a tune now and again.
Does she have a name?
Do you feel okay.
You gotta go now, I bet.
What's going on...?
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
In a better place.  I hope.
I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
I went to see a friend of mine.
Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
Mom tried to cook.
You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?
You buying?  He kinda wanders around.  You'll see him if you pay attention.
Holy shit... you're dead, man...
Do you know what you destroyed?
Cute nickname, don't you think?
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
Top Dollar.
I wish to possess what you have now.
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
What the hell are you?
Shelly?
Miss her?
Get it?
Glad to see you're finally with the program.
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Shut up.
You'll be alone.
Don't waste my time.
Blow yourself, bigmouth.
Coupla more rings... 24k.
18k.  Crap.
Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
We've got company.
No shooting.
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
I'm Kathryn.
Have we met?
I don't think so.
Did you know Sebastian well?
Are you okay?
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
Excuse me?
I have his journal.
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
You promise not to say anything?
On my mother's life.
Junior.
Got a boyfriend back home?
No.
You a lesbo?
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
Excuse me. Excuse me!
What'cha reading?
The Fountainhead.
Great book.
Romantic? He rapes her.
That's a matter of opinion.
I sincerely doubt it.
How's the water?
I never said that.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
Why not?
Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
Need a lift?
No thank you.
How are you today?
You don't even know me.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
Who?
That's none of your business.
How about tonight?
I'm busy.
Doing what?
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
I'm... I'm alright.
How was your date?
Wait, don't hang up.
Okay?
What are you doing?
What are you reading?
Of Human Bondage.
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
Sure. Have a good night.
I'm doing some volunteer work.
Need any company?
Oh please.
"I actually feel good about myself?"
No.
Am I bothering you?
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
You know what? I don't take it back.
Why are you doing this?
That's not fair.
You really want to know?
I just came to say goodbye.
I think that's for the best.
Please don't go.
Hi.
Hi.
This isn't working out for me anymore.
What are you saying?
Why aren't you understanding?
But you knew this was important to me.
Ben Schwarz.
Schwarz. Jewish?
German.
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
Where did you say she's from?
Greg McConnell.
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
Oh, I suck. I suck.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Where did you find those?
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
Are you for real?
Do you want to learn or not?
See that wasn't so bad.
Okay.
What are you saying?
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
No.
Well do you like him?
Okay.
You'd do that for me?
Who is it?
Something awful happened last night.
What do you mean?!
Cecile, you have to tell me.
No.
What do I do then?
Cecile, you had an orgasm.
But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it?
It's like a secret society.
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
What year are you in?
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
But I thought high school is only four years.
Excellent.
You think he'll like it?
What are you doing?
I'm sorry that was out of line.
I want to go home.
I was just kidding.
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
And then I can go home?
Just a kiss, right?
What are you doing?
Want to join me?
Am I suppose to be this sore?
Is it me?
Where are you going?
Need any company?
No.
Want a blow job?
Good night Cecile.
I do.
My daughter, Rachel.
Good luck, Sebastian.
Hi, mom.
Who told you?
Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
Nudie pictures, what do you think?
Oh baby... oh baby...
Greg, is that you under the covers?
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
And you think she bought it?
I'm pretty sure she did.
Pretty sure or sure sure?
She bought it.
Is she with you?
Who is this?
No.
Pleased to meet you.
Hello.
Ronald?
Yeah?
Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
Care to make a wager on that?
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
Be more specific.
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
You can put it anywhere.
Even there?
I'm working on it.
Loser.
Blow me.
Call me later.
You would not believe what--
I'm at your service.
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
Moving along quite well.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Who are you calling?
Yippy.
Who are you spying on?
That her?
Shut up.
What's your problem?
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
Morning!
She shot you down.
Bad time?
You didn't?
Oh yes.
Tell me all the details.
It was... Fantastic.
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
Some other time.
Excuse me?
I'm not in the mood.
And that's why you're leaving?
It clearly is why.
I want to fuck.
No, I'm not.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
Why so nervous?
How have you dumped girls in the past?
I have a flair for drama.
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
I thought we should celebrate.
Well done.
In any event, you still owe me my reward.
Get off me!
Will you calm down?
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
I accept. Now get out.
Get out? We had an arrangement.
I think you have your answer.
I got your message and came as quick as I could.
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
Not at all. What's wrong?
It's Cecile.
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
I can't thank you enough.
Let me get that for you.
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
It's desperate that I talk to her.
I've already told you, she's not home.
What do you want?
I need to talk to Annette.
She's not here.
Do you know where she is?
Do you know when she'll be back?
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
I'll do that.
It's really important.
Yes, you already did.
Right after we played backgammon.
We played backgammon?
I did?
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
I said, do you want some water?
What time is it?
Did she show up?
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
You're a lucky guy.
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
What are you talking about?
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
Did you hit her?
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
Ronald, I'm sorry.
That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
What are saying, darling?
Mommy --
Yes, darling.
Did you ever make a wish?
Oh, lots of times.
But where did you get it, Amy?
Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
On the back street  a green house
The Farren house
I got my wish anyway.
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
But it's already come true.
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
Where'd you get this, darling?
She was very pretty.
What's her name?
Irena.
Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
Where is everybody?
Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
I think I should.  3000W?
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
Did you hear the child out?
I'm never unfair.
What is it, Alice?
Ollie.
What?
I haven't had my breakfast.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
I live right here.
Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
Yes, daddy.
Did you mail then?
Yes, I did.
Where did you mail them?
Amy, not that old tree!
But wishes don't come true.
What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
And who did the voice belong to?
Daddy, it's true.
These are all from me.
Just you wait!
Daddy!
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
But there's no one here, darling.
What'd you get for Christmas?
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
Who are you?
You called me by my name.
Irena. But who are you?
I'm your friend.
I've wanted a friend.
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
But where is that?
I can not tell you.
Will you be friend for always?
For as long as you'll let me.
You'll always play with me?
Can't you get it, darling?
But you must!
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
Your children?
All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
Merry Christmas, Irena.  I brought you a present.
Merry Christmas.
So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
It's you...Irena...my friend!
You mustn't be afraid.
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
You?
Yes, Amy.
Look at my ring.
That's a fine-looking ring.
Will you come soon?
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
Bad luck to see death in the snow.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
Because it can't. It's dead.
But I only came to give back the ring.
The Headless Horseman --
What?
Who's Herne the Huntsman?
Hurry, hurry.
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
Good night, mother, good night.
Let the child stay.
There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am.
What is it, ma'am?
It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
Waiter! She needs more water.
Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
No.
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
What?
Wow your body's really hot.
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
There was a sale.
I mean where on your body?
A dog at Victoria's Secret?
How's the rest of your health?
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
Nearly four.
Jennifer?
No it's mom.
We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Translation: a total geek.
Anything's better than Mark.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
Do you really need these?
Only to see.
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
Or if there's a full moon.
Where are all the mediums?
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
And he was ripped limb from limb?
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
So did you do it?
Did I kill him? Of course not!
No, did you fuck him?
At least your PMS is over.
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
Rule one: always wear make-up.
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
What did he say?
Charming Carlton.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
So where's this infamous arm now?
I put it down the garbage disposal.
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
I've been here. What day is it?
Tuesday. Are you okay?
Shit, I guess I missed work.
Frida, Carlton's dead.
Oh no.
And he was missing an arm.
Get rid of him!
Holy shit, I don't know.
He's been here all night?
DON'T call the police.
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
Why the fuck would you do that?
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
You expecting someone?
I think I just got my period.
Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
What choice do we have?
So what do I do?
Fall in love.
You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
I think George knows.
About Mark? Carlton?
Hello?
I know.
So you're Grant's secretary?
Well, whattdaya think?
Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
They say sex is great for cramps.
I really gotta pee.
I didn't have to pee then.
Oh come on. Knock it off.
Knock what off?
Uh huh. So pee.
What, you got a date or somethin'?
You look different. I mean you look good.
Look what you did!
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
Frida, you know you're it for me.
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
Where'd you get the bike?
It's a matter of life and death.
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
Wow.
The Nielson's?
On your desk.
Script coverage?
On your desk.
Coffee and...
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
Did you change your hair?
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
No.
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
You busted me.
I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
So what book did you buy?
It's stupid.
My mom used to get PMS too.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
Goodnight.
No. I was doing my laundry.
Was there anything in that washer?
Everything okay?
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
No, I got it. It's okay.
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
Except Mark of course.
You didn't say it.
Your breasts feel larger.
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
Go away. I might hurt you.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
Peter I love you too but...
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
Here's a towel.
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
You got a dog?
No, I have a cat.
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
It's for you. Frida.
Take some allergy medicine.
Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
How the hell is that your business?
You want her sheets?
See he was cheating from the get go.
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
I told you she was innocent.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
What?
He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
He means the last that we know of.
Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
And that was 28 days ago today.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
I need something to keep me awake.
Sell maps?
How long have you been here?
Maybe ten minutes...  Thatís strange.
What's he doing here?
The other one?
His wife.
Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
They don't speak English...
How will we interrogate them?
Police.  Nobody move.
He tried to kill me!
Doctor!  What brings you here?
You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?
I don't know what you're talking about.
In there.
Was that for real down there?
Good evening, sir.
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
Why do you want to speak to him?
Itís extremely important to my investigation...
Dammit!
Iím your new assistant.
I didnít requisition a secretary.
You typed this report?
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
It seems fine.
How can I submit this?
Why, yes.
Where are we going?
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
People...  after me.
I don't know who they are.
Why are they after you?
Don't know that either.
They didn't have faces.
Where do you think this goes?
Can't let you in...  sorry.
They've taken my mind, my memories...
Look!  This is a good one!
What is that door?
Such a joker!  Like your father.
You see it?
Where does it lead?
A book of delusions.  Anything else?
But I...
I see.  The verdict, yes...
I didn't realise...
No.  I, ah...
Someoneís after me.
Donít kill me!
You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
Your name is John White.
Bad dreams?
Yes.
If you like.
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
Known me for long?
I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
I'm nothing then.
What are you doing?
You're a liar!
What are you hiding?
What happened to you?
What is it?
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
How do I get there?  Tell me.
You understand what you'll be doing?
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
Don't say a .
Uh --Mr. Alexander?
What?
Is this dangerous or anything?
No more than the usual.
They barely talk anymore.
Now, remember -- keep it simple.
What's with her?
For a month.
A month.
Right and don't embellish.
I'm not certain about...
Mr. President...
What the hell is this?
The Washington Post.
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
.. Nothing.
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
Oh... I'm fired?
You're fired.
Fine?
I can't believe he'd do this.
Don't call the Vice President!
... What?
Just don't call him, Alan!
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
I don't give a shit.
Till what?
TilT we figure something out.
Up and around?  Soon?
A condition...
We think so.
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
What about the wife?
Clean.
Check his kids.
Clean.
Nobody's got clean kids.
Uh, let me get back to you...
It's a homeless shelter.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
No!...  WE didn't anything...
Do we have anything on the budget today?
What are you gonna do?
I'm going to kill him.
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
He's only doing what you told him to.
Don't do this.
I'll lock him away for good.
What do you mean by that?
Just what you think I mean.
Are you threatening me?
So you want to go swimming?
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
I was gonna do something with Joan.
It's fine.
They could put you in jail.
I don't think so
This is undeclared income.
And who's gonna find out?
The government
That'd be great.
Extend things?
Will he be alright?
No.
I'm afraid so.
In the car?
In the car.
A teleprompter.
The teleprompter.  Is it hooked up?
I don't think so.
At a press conference.
I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
Fine.
Gimme a quarter.
What?
Let's call it a night.   I can't take any more.
What do you mean you made it all up?
This is wrong, Alan!
Wrong...
`Dave'?
Does it make the cars any better?
What are they?
Fertility beads.
They re not my attack dogs.
What do you mean?
Oh... Hi.
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
... Sometimes they do.
What?
How'd you get started?
You're not?
Your government needs your help.
Really?
We'd like to hire you.
I can't say.
Yeah.
You got a gun?
You ever use it?
Call Bob and Reed.  Tell them I need them immediately.
I was waiting for that jack.
You mean with you and everything?
You're kidding.
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
Who?
Well...
You sure you don't want a lift back home?
What are you staring at?
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
You bet.
Don't you have anything to say to me?
I care about the homeless.
What's wrong with a magic trick?
Oh... Yeah.
That was quite a thing you did today.
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
Where are you going?
Just souvenirs.  Towels and stuff.
How were you gonna get home?
You sure this goes somewhere?
I don't mind.
What?
Are you hungry?
You have a lot of secrets.
So what do you do the rest of the time?
You know, secretaries and stiff.
You find people jobs?
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
It was okay?
Well I guess...
What?
I can't.
Yeah.   He's a good man.
Hi.
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
I know.
I missed...
It could be fun.
The Monroe?
We're all set,  sir.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or what?
What is it?
You'd hold us back. We have to go on.
Miss Henried, I think you better...
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
Sir. It's quite clear that...
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.
Datura.
Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes.
What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You tell him we was rebels?
We got a boat.
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
What you wanna do?
He is dying. He knows it.
TONY....TONY....
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to...
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
Where are you going, Tyler?
My..."detail", sir. We're going to bury the heads.
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
Step up here, Tyler.
You fired that shot, didn't you?
No, sir.
It's been fired.
Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
Tricks...Jesus...
So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
Sounds boring to me.
You know how many demerits we're talking?
I don't think they're in school.
Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
Thigh man?  Mr. "K" was a hell raiser.
I don't know.  I don't get it.
It will?  How do you figure?
Women swoon!
At Chet Danburry's house.
Yeah.
Well?
What do you mean you don't know?
Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
All right.  I'll try anything once.
Yaa, I'm a dead poet!
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
Well...
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
Oh God, it's over now!
Damn it, Nuwanda.  You idiot.
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
I told you, that's a secret.
I think he's sweet.
Welcome. back, Mr. Dalton.  How's your father?
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
Hey, he's your roommate.
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying
Who's in?
Charlie, That was great!  Where did you learn to play like that?
Charlie...
It's Nuwanda.
Nuwanda, what is going on?
You what?!  How did you do that?
No.
What are you going to do? - Charlie?
Why don't you talk to Mr. Keating about it?
This is stupid.
It's all right, Chet.
Chris.  We got it.  Let's go.
It does?  What?
Stop what?
What are you doing?!
You fucked up little prick!
Pleased to meet you.
So, uh, where are you in school?
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
carpe breastum.  Seize the breast.
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
Are you going with Chet?
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
Then come with me.
Dead Poets honor.
What is that?
I have to go home. Chet might call.
We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
Carpe Diem... seize the day.
Very good, Mr._?
Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
A yawp?
Good god, boy! Yell!
Yawp!
Again!  Louder!
YAWP!
LOUDER!
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
Come on boys, don't be shy.
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
Gosh, they don't give you much room around here, do they?
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
Isn't there an easier way?
Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!
All right!  What'd she say?
All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
Any group pictures in the annual?
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
But father, I'm assistant editor.
I'm sorry, Neil.
But father, it's not fair.
You know me, always taking on too much.
Weird.
I say we go tonight.  Everybody in?
Where is this cave he's talking about?
What is this, a midnight study group?
Look at this.
What is it?
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
My brother went here.
So what do you think of my father?
I'll take him over mine.
What?
What is it then?
Yes.  But
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
I don't want to read.
I've found it.
A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?
I know that.  What's it got to do with you?
Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
From you?
From my father and Nolan.
Neil, you're not gonna...
Todd, what's the matter?
It's my birthday.
This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
Here, villain, draw and ready. where art thou?
I will be with thee straight.
I'll come to the performance.
Yea, art thou there?
Put more into it!
Visit from my father.
You the Captain?
How do we get out of here?
Who are you?
He's the owner...
It's not going to help us!
What the hell are you talking about?
Right here...middle of nowhere...
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
And no questions asked.
Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
How soon can we get up and running?
We were talking about my schedule...
Not an option.
Where are my men?
Hanover, listen...
Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
Did you clear this?
Who gives a shit about aft?
I'm not staying here!
Now look what you did!
What other bunch?
The thieves.
I'm not a thief.
Then who are you?
Unless you collected on the insurance...
What are you people talking about?
Noooo!
Jesus Christ lady...
What are those things?
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
You people...rich people...
I'm not rich people.
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
That's what I do.
Seen a lot of islands?
Anti social?
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
I don't know where it is!
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
Yeah you did...
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
The "come back" kind.
How do you know that?
Like cattle...
You're saying they can think?
What's the matter?
What is it?
A meat locker.
Looking good...
It's not them...it's it...
You want ME to go up there?
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
I don't mean to drop in unannounced ...you ready...
You don't take orders very well, do you?
I don't take orders at all.
Where's you friend?
Let's just keep going.
Hanover!! Hanover!!
Shut up! You hear me!!
Can we use our indoor voice please...
Here's what I think...I think these mokes below are a hit sqaud.
...Jagger was here...I was here...
It's okay...come on...
Finnegan, what the hell was that?
Joey... Which way's aft?
Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg?
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here?
I have been.
And what have you come up with?
Man, don't go up there...
Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
Or maybe not.
I mean...where is everbody?
Where are you going?
Why don't you back off?
What the hell does that mean?
Maybe plans changed...
What was that?
Nothing.
Someone's back there.
Check it out!
Maybe it's the wrong ship.
She fucked you?
She fucked me.
She fucked me too.
She fucked you?
She fucked us both.
Yeah.
Fucking women, man...
Fuel up. Need fuel.
Those are mine!
You want 'em?
Damn right!
That's mustard!
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
I'll get the boots.
Get the boots.
Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!
John,we're going huntin'.
Who's going?
We're all going.
Nick's going?
Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
Here's to huntin'.
Ammo! Get the ammo!
It is not!
You're full of shit.
Who's full of shit?
You're full of shit!
I'm telling you, they changed it!
They did not!
They did too!
Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
It's Nick!
Tell him, Vince!
Let's go!!!
I know! I fuckin' know!
You don't!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
That's new, isn't it?
Whee-uu!
He's serious. Vince is fuckin' serious!
Fucking A.
You're back.
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
Sure. Why not.
You talk to him?
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
I have to go.
But you must come in.
No, I --
But I insist.
I have to go.
Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
I came to see Merle.
Yeah.
You are his friend.
That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
Wait! First I give you special fuck!
She's in back.
Thanks.
Oh. Fine.
Get anything?
No.
You know a guy named Merle?
Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!
Where's it gone?
Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
Not so good.
Sal.
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
Kind of. You didn't know?
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
Nick, she won't say why.
Biederman! Where's Biederman!
You Biederman?
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
Linda, what's the matter?
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
What?
Will you marry me?
What kind of beer would you like?
I don't know.
How are you?
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
Nick?
What are you doing?
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
You're going hunting?
What?
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
I don't know.
I'm just so lonely.
You seem... disturbed.
Playing?
We... Three bullets.
Who the hell is he?
You can do it, Sal.
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
Merle?
Sal!  Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you know anything?
I know.
That way it sets.
I just wait. You know?
So do I.
You do?
You think about it?
The shot?
Yeah... I guess.
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
Nick, he just came back.
What'd he say?
Pow.
Pow.
Is he from here?
From Nam?
Merle --
It's ahead, by the tree.
Hey, Nick?
Huh?
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
What are you, God?
What are you, hoping?
What else?
I thought you might be praying.
I'm doing that too.
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
Forget Sal.
We gotta play with more bullets.
How many bullets?
Three bullets -- minimum.
When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
Merle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you?
Nick!... I thought you went home.
I like it, Nick.
Bullshit! That's bullshit!
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
Here, here! This is it!
Watch it, shithead!
Then lemme have 'em.
No.
No.
What do you mean, no???
That's it. No. No way.
You're one fuckin' bastard, Merle. You know that? You're one fucking bastard!
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
Great. That's great.
See you Monday.
Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.
Nick. Hey. How's things?
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
What's that noise?
What?
What's that noise?
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
Great. Hey. That's great.
I'm gonna stay here, Nick.
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
Did you go hunting.
Yeah.
Did you get one?
No.
Where?
It's Merle, Sal.
Merle gave me this?
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?
Well, who'd you get married to?
Cynthia! Sure.
What the hell's that for?
No.
No!
Never one.
You're full of shit!
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
The fuck I did!!!
Up.
Down.
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Yeah?
Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
What did you say?
Who is it?
I want to ask you a few questions.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
I want to see my wife and kid.
Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
Give it to me.
The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be.
Hello Wade.
I want to stop aging.
What is it?  I'm about to go on.
That wasn't your plan, was it?
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
Sir, your transmission's fading.
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
You okay?
How do I look?
Sir---
Need help?
I got it.  I got it.
You sure?  I can help you.
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
Nobody's looking.
Maybe I should put on the training whe---
Not the 'T' word.
Are you a cop?
I'm ready.
I have to go home, Sanchez.
See those guys?
They're going to rob that bank.
How do you know?
There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
You can't turn him off.  He's the Commissioner.
Wanna come?
Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.
Can I ask you something?
Hey, buddy...
NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down.  That's when we'll get him.
Why?
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
You need anything else?
I'll be okay.
Good night, Wade.
I'll have a cup of coffee?
No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
Yes, sir.
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
Maybe I should turn myself in.
You're not pregnant, are you?
Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
Rip Van Winkle.
How ya feeling?
What's this?
Sanchez...?
I'm here.
You treat her nice.
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
I just heard.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
You be careful.
No.  I want to be with you.
This is the guy that killed my partner.
Demolition Man.
What's it mean?
You never want to find out.
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
But he was such a good cop.
You all right?
Yeah.
Seat's too high.
Yes.
I'm going to be a policeman.
What's your name?
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
Bye.  Thanks.
Hi.
Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?
This little thing says I can't.
You could always take it off.
Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A-1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.
Belle Dee. I'm from over the mountain.
I'll take it.
Let's dance together -- Belle.
We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
The people, Jabez -- the people.
Belle --
I didn't.
You're lying.
Lying to you -- Why should I?
Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
Guess there will, if it says so.
Young man -- you got me there.
And what about Daniel Webster?
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
But I like the new one better.
Howdy, Jabez.
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
You're not -- Dorothy.
No. She's gone.
Never mind. What's your name?
Belle.
No, Stone!
Mornin', Jabez ...
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
What's the matter with you?
You are afraid!
Afraid ... of what?
But what becomes of our souls?
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
Don't say that -- I know it is --
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
Eloquent speech, Neighbor Stone -- couldn't have done better myself --  -- under the circumstances.  Thank you.
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
Coming along, Jabez?
Why -- good morning, Squire.
Oh!
But -- I was just lucky.
Well, Jabez -- I'm a little pressed for time. You wanted to discuss something -- some business --
Why of course --
You are not so sure that he'll come.
Why not -- ?
How much?
Jabez -- help!
I think his leg is broken.
Well -- what are we going to do?
We can still use my butter money.
Your butter money?
Do you think I'm grudging it?
Mary -- it's gone.
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
Mary--
Jabez!
It feels fine now, Jabez.
What do you think of that, Jabez?
We must go on home, Jabez.
Tired?
Mary --
I'll get it, Jabez.
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
Mary --
What happened.... Where are you taking him?
I am going to lock him up.
But Jabez, I never said that!
Why don't they come --
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
You must go now, Mary -- you must!
Jabez -- Jabez!
You know that, son.
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
I dunno.
I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
It don't matter!
What's that you say, Son?
Ma -- is she? --
My son ... what's the matter?
Let him try it.
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
It seems such an obvious candidature to us all.
Mary -- Jabez --
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!
She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me, right away!
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!
Hullooo!
It's only a short drive, Mr. Webster.
Say, that's pretty good, young man.
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
I want someone to talk to ...
Why don't you?
The past six months.
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
But meant her moving here.
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
How 'bout some Christmas music?
It's corny, but I could live with it.
Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
One of yours?
The police...?
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying?
-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
Bad for your health anyway.
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
You...you're an American?
I'm a cop from New York.
Hans.  Your Hans.
I'm going to count to three...
Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
Three down, four to go --
I...have a request.
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
Oh...Where does he live?
I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --
Excuse me, I'm looking for --
Holly Gennero?
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
I'm ahead of you...partner.
Safe and sound, thanks to you. What the fuck was that?
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
Al?  Al, you there?
Yeah?  What's the odds?
They way you drive, I can see why.
Hey, you couldn't know.
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
Is that him?
Gene -- you smilin'?
No.  I never smile any more.
They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
Jesus, you're the man!
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes.
Jackie - what are you talking about?
Hey, don't take the car!
The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
Yeah.  A lot of guns.
Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
I'll kiss the baby for you.
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
Hello.  Hello, Leon.
Hello, Sonny.
How are you doing?
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
Well.... huh ...
Ooohh....
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
Yeah.  It was terrible.
So... that sure is something.
You're crazy.
That's it.
You're really crazy.
I know!
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
What am I supposed to do?
Denmark?  Sweden?
So!  Sal is with you?
Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
I know I am.  I know!
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
I don't have a choice.
Look... who's on the phone?
That's good then.  You've found something.
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
Do you still want the operation?
Well, then...
Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.
Right.  See you sometime.
I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
What are you doin' in there?
What a fuckin' comedy!  WNEW plays all the hits.
They're okay.
You alone, or you got confederates?
I'm not alone.
How many you got in there?
I got Sal.
Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?
Call me Sonny-boy.
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
I frisk you?
You frisk me.
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
Okay, give us the women.
Calm down, you're not ...
He wanted to kill me!
What do you want?
What the hell you doin' back there?
They were ...
You tryin' to fuck me?
I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
What else?
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
Yeah?
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
He's all doped up.
Here comes the FBI.  You men lookin' for protection?  We got all the police right here.
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup!
Hey... let him out!
Okay, is the vault open?
What's the matter with you?
Believe me, I'm on your side.
Howard, give him the keys...
The gun's right on your back...
For God's sake, will you please go now?  We gave you every nickel we got.
Hello, Mulvaney here...
Now, you -- what's your name?
Don't ask me questions.  I got connections.  You find out who I am, you're cold meat.
What if I take you with me?
Special to me, too.
You like me?
Would I hire you?
Yeah.
Why not?
Mister Mulvaney?
Yeah?
Are you a lawyer?
No.  I had some legal training, but...
You got Bank Americard?
What is it, Sam?
Everything's all right?  You okay?
Thanks again, Sam.
I'm glad it's okay.
It's up to you ladies.
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?
You were terrific, too!
How did you know your son was involved?
Did you know he was a homosexual?
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
I used to, but I stopped.
You stopped?  Why?
Pure?
My body?  What for?
You gonna smoke the cigarette?
Ah, Jesus...
He's gone?
Where's the money?
It's the cops.  Shit!
You mean that?
... The bodies out the door.
I want him to think that.
I want him to think that.
He wants one.
Dead or alive?
To show that we're negotiating.
All right ... send them the guard.
We'd kill ourselves.
Does that still go?
Sonny -
They're trying to come through the door!
It's the FBI.  He wants to come in.
Sal?
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
Hey, Sal ... How you doin'?
Okay, Sonny.
There it is, Sal.  Sal?
First off, get the lights back on and the air conditioning.
Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
I want them all.
Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.
Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
Sonny!  Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please?
What can he do, he's clean...
I ain't eaten all day.  I just realized it.
Okay, who's the head teller here?
I am.
I forgot she's in here.
He's got diabetes.  He's not a well person.
My kids ... Kimmy and Jimmy.
Hey, let's get ready!
Here's your document, Sonny.
Fuck!  We did it!
What do you want here, Ma?  You could of watched it on TV.
Not now, Mom, please.
No!
Why are you doing this?
Doing what?
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
How much?
Morning.
Who the hell is that?
What is it, Choco?
Tell him it's not cute. Will you tell him, Domino!?
Jesus Christ! What's that smell?
Fella could get used to a life this ordinary.
What about your toe?
Did it hurt?
Hello?
<i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
<i>I'm calling from the Kappa Epsilon Gamma house at California University.</i>
<i>What happened to them?</i>
You're breaking up... I can't hear you.
<i>Remove... ... the... right arm.</i>
I've already formulated a plan.
<i>Did you get all four?</i>
Where is the money?
That's the rumor on the street.
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
Chi-Chi!  CHI-CHI!
Is that you, Domino?
HE'S STILL ALIVE, EDNA!
LOCUS! BABY... I'M HERE!
Is that the decoder?
Cunt.
Stop it.
Cunt.
So who is this <i>Choko?</i> Is he your new boyfriend?
God help us. God help us all.
<i>My real father was an actor. He died when I was a little girl.</i>
You can save that Pretty Woman shit. The name is Domino.
Really? Did you play in a band?
I... <i>love...</i> Pat Benatar.
Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.
Cool it, Choco.

No. What's the big deal?
What did he say about the arm?
Uhhh... I have no idea what you just said.
Many times.
Not really.
Your theory is valid... <i>in theory.</i>
Fast and or furious.
This girl is going to be a star. She just tells it like it is.
You were good.

Do me a favor.  Go to work.
Jade.
How come you're not at Sal's?
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
Hurry up and get dressed.
I'm coming.
No.
Yo, I'm gone.
I'll see you out.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
He's just being nice.
Nice!
He's completely innocent.
You are too crude.
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
Twenty "D" Duracells.
Twenty "C" Duracells.
D, not C.
How many you say?
Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!
That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
WAKE UP!
You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts.
I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough.
Motherfucker wasn't saying shit.
It's a fucking shame.
Sweet Dick Willie.
That's my name.
Let it be broke.
Can ya dig it?
ML?
What?
Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?
I didn't say nobody, I said you.
Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now you know how I got that name.
Korea man is OK.  Let's leave him alone.
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
Mookie, if your friends can't behave, they're not welcome.
Mookie!  How is anybody gonna call in?
Depends.
Can you pay me now?
I would like to get paid now.
Sal, I don't care if you fire me this exact minute, leave my sister alone.
Yeah, do you know 'em?
C'mon, Sal.
Do we now?
Quit bullshitting.
How much?  How much do I owe you?
Ya just got paid, so leave me the fuck alone.
Keep it.
You keep it.
It's supposed to be even hotter today.
You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
No.  What are you gonna do?
Mookie?
Doctor, this is Sal talkin'.
When?
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Hot.  Hot.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
Shit!  I forgot.
Your memory is really getting bad.
And I really wanted some ice cream too.
I can run out and get it.
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
I can't be staying long anyway.
You a blue-moon fool.
Then we'll do something else.
What else?
It's cold.
It's 'pose to be cold.
Later for you.
Meda.  Meda.
Where are you going?
Tina, I'll be right back.
Be a man.

Smack him back.

Who's your favorite basketball player?
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
Mister Señor Love Daddy is cool.

That's what I think.
I'll do that.
Pino, no joke.  C'mon, answer.
I was going to buy a slice.
I'm listening.
I love you, my brother.
Get the broom.
Sez who?
I know this.
I love you.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
Mookie's OK.

I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
I like Mookie a lot.
Pino, get a broom and sweep out front.
Pino, relax, will ya.
I should have Vito go with you all the time.
C'mere.  Don't get too friendly with da Mook.
Pop, stop lying.
The both of youse, shaddup.
Pop asked you.

Yeah, we're closed. So go away.
Oh my god, are you alright?
Ting tao kuun jahn leeka leeka powww.
She's saying... a beautiful swan...
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah oh che.
CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?
Excuse me.
Depends how you define 'new'...
You're the kid who was home schooled.
Hey guys.
Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, Jethica?
Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
Excuse me?
Come over around seven.
O'clock?
Yeah...
Ooh gross.
Would you like something to drink?
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
Just down the hall.
Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
What?
Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready.
The name's Walter.
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
Wow just like Marco Polo.
I don't follow.
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.
Is it okay if he spends the night?
Then a sleep-over is okay by me. Okay boys, eat up.
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
You could've saved that for the tooth fairy!
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
Probably because we've never met.
Home school. Til today.
Home school? What's that?
I think it's just over there.
Is that what I think it is?
No, it's a treasure map.
What?
Don't we want them to talk to us?
No no no no no.
Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!
You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day.
God, she's beautiful. My wiener's all tingly.
Who's Principal Collins?
The principal.
You know, you're the first person I've brought here.
The second R is silent.
One day they'll find a cure.
Maybe we should ask Jessica to join the class.
Got any crazy eights?
Who's Captain Rob?
Yeah, go-cart accident.
Whoa. What was that?
Your mom made a move on me.
I will stop this car right now.
You take that back!
Shut Up! Buttlick!
Where did you learn that word?
That would be me, sir. The wife made stew last night.
Collins is a great man!
...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
I didn't know that.
Welcome to public school, my friend.
You're it.
Owww.
LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed.
According to the map, we're just about at school.
Our own special bus.
Nope. I was right.
Sucks for you.
Who's your partner?
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
Sure I do. On one condition.
I kinda screwed things up.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
I don't think so.
HARRY, can you hear me?
You have beautiful eyes.
Hey, where did you come from?
I bet you want your head scratched.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
LLOYD, what are you doing? That's JESSICA and... my mom.
But-
HARRY! I found the treasure!
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny?
No one knows?
Me, me, me!
No. What happened?
A raft.
A blimp.
George Washington!
Who?
Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
If you have to ask, you don't know.
Yeah, that's why I asked.
I know I did.
You're it.
Am not.
Are, too.
It's okay. I want the rush.
Hey, it's Jessica.
Hey, look. Ice cream.
But my mom gave me the map.
I lugged it all over town!
I made the polar bear pants.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
I... found that rock.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of your mix tapes.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
Start the tape, Lloyd.
Hey there goes Principal Collins!
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
The one on the left.
Damn! What are the odds?
What?
She's one of a kind.
Try one in a million!
Sorry, Charlie.
That's gross.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
Are you wearing a coconut bra?
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
I don't know what you're talking about.
My parents are going to wonder where I am.
TURK, leave him alone.
TURK, what are you doing here?
Special Needs class.
Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in!
HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.
Well I was born in St. Louis.
What are you doing here?
So could you get us into the principal's office?
So, when can we do it?
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
Me too. I'm almost there.
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.
... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Do I know you?
Duh. I'm in your class at school.
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
You really are a pirate.
Can you believe it?
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
How much homework is there?
Okay.
Do we have a deal?
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
Hey you two. Lights out.
Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
You know I do!
What are you crazy kids doing in my tool shed?
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself.
Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus.  Lose her!
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
I'm not sure if I can do this.
I am strong!
I can turn on all the faucets in my house.  Even the hose.
God, I've missed you.
We start our own class?
You said "aloha" twice.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
And, take some more pictures.
Wow, you are smart.
Knock knock.
Who's there?
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
What?
Everything?
Oh, just like the President.
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
JESSICA. Are you sure?
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
My Lord!
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
My thanks.
What's that you're saying?
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
Yes, my Lord.
We have just folded space from Ix...
Yes?... How was your journey?
Basically...
No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
I'm sorry Gurney.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
It could only be one thing....  It's a crysknife.
Remove her gag!
A million deaths are not enough for Yueh...
Run!
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
Man-carved steps.
You've worn a stillsuit before?
Always?
Always.
We call that one Muad'dib.
The Water of Life.
My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well?
We surprised a band of smugglers.
Long live the fighters!
What's in the box?
It burns.
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
What can be done has been done.
... Many men have tried.
Did they try and fail?
You mustn't speak of...
Those sounds could be imitated.
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
Greetings.  I am the Count.
Say, that's a funny place to sleep.
So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!
Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
No.  I don't work here.
Why were you buying a coffin?
You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
Do you want me to get it for you?
Are you sure this is okay?
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
Ah!  This is very exciting.
Bela, what happened?!
I didn't feel well...
Let me take you to the hospital.
Should I call a doctor?
"Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap.
Goodbye!  Goodbye!
So how'd we do?
Bela, are you ready?
Mmph?  Where am I?
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
Eddie, you screwed up.
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Goddamn, it's cold!
Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.
Don't let me slow you down.
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
Why are you here??
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
What are you doing?
I was thinking about killing myself.
Don't worry.
I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
And, cut...
Eddie, how was I?
Last night was quite a romp.
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
So guess where I'm going next weekend?
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
You mean a Tesla coil?
PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
And, CUT!  PRINT IT!  LET'S MOVE ON!
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
Um, okay... roll camera
Rolling.
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
What happened?!  Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
This is kind of a stream--
Wow.
And who may you be?
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
H-how'd you know?!
I guessed.
I don't understand.
Bravo!  Bravo!  Magnifico!
Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
Will he be okay?
Dolores, give me your shoes.
Ed, it was only one review.
Better than not getting a job?
Who?  Robert Taylor?!
No!  A horror movie star!
Boris Karloff!?
Close!  The <u>other</u> one!
Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
It takes me comfortable.
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
I'm no good.
Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
But there's plenty of other parts.
Like <u>what</u>?!
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
I'm going to my mother's.
That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
I'm tired of living on the fringe.
Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
I understand you just moved here?
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
That's not true --
So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans.
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
But Bela Lugosi's in it!
Mr. Wood?!
Hmm, so you're in the picture business?
Would that work?
Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
Mr. Reynolds!
Glad you could fit me in your schedule.
Could we moovf to table?
So, Mr. Johnson --
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
Tor, I should be getting home.
My eyes are killink me.
What is happening?
Is there a script?
Lugosi?
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
Hello.  You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
I got married last night.
Oh.  Congratulations.
The marriage already ended.
How long's he been here?
Oh, it's you again.
Oh, hi.
You look beat.
I am.  How's your father?
Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.
I just picked them up on the way over...
What do you mean?
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
Oh.  Okay.
Stop!
What was that?
I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...
You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!
No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
The poor girl's out of a job.
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
I can't get it to go up.
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
Ed, I'm so happy for you.
Let's get married.
<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph?
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
What's uncanny?
I don't know.
Yes!
You're <u>sure</u>???
What octopus motor?
Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside.
Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.
Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
This is our choir director.  He's gonna play the young hero.
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
Isn't that the same thing?
What if--you're vomiting?
What if I'm vomiting?
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
Yeah, so... ?
How's your mother?
You thought it was me?
I'm moving out.
Did you see that?
You're nuts.
This is real, Bananahead!
You think she really likes him?
She doesn't give a shit about him.
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
Great line.
What if Shari's the dream?
Mr. Pekurny.
Thank you. Can I see her?
Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
Who?
You said that.
You know who we are?
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about this?
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!
Right.
So he killed himself.
Eddie? ...
Are the TV people with you?
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
Hey, he cheated on her.
How's Marcia? She all right?
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
Oh my God!
I mean, that worked out.
I can't believe you're taking his side.
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
She could've been a nurse.
Could've been a nurse?
Eddie...
I'm at the hospital.
Oh God. What hospital?
The doctor said you were having sex.
To you? In front of him?  With the...
Oh my god! On TV!
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
What's going on over there?
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
Hi. Is Shari here?
No.
What is she, at work?
She left.
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.
They're gonna mock our foibles.
Our what?
Are you asking me?
How much less?
Um, yeah, I was gonna ...
I batted!
Cream rinse?
Dynamite.
So maybe this is my dynamite.
Ha!
Really?
Oh my God.
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Leave. Go.
Can't we just --
What are you doing?
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
That's lucky.
Um...
I know, I ...
Shari, I really like you...
I really like you too...
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
... yeah, then, but...
Shari...
Everybody hates me!
No. Who?
Page three of the Post.
There's a list.
Really? 
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
I'm sorry.
Come on, let's go.
Where?
I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
Okay.
I need to talk.
It's not their fault.
What's up?
What is?!
Show business.
You're in show business?
Thumbsucker!
I'm making a tape.
I got your message. Way to go!
All right.
Yeah?!
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
Who is it?
Hi.
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God!
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
Why me?
You brought the cameras here!
You brought the girl!
... Ray?
I know.
Look, we gotta talk.
Good-bye, brother!
Hi, Shari.
Who's Shari?
No -- keep it.
You don't recognize me.
Who is it?
I was in jail.
The whole time? Eighteen years?
No. Two times.
What...
Check forging.
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
What...
Do you still have it?
Hi.
Are you busy tomorrow night?
Can I help with anything?
Mm.
Good?
Ohhh...
Ohh... do you own a cat?
Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
pierdo.
Tu
pierdes.
El/ella -
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --
Anything wrong?
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
Yeah, just --
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
Dick... Dick,..
Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --
Okay.  Yeah.  We know
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
Larry?
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
Well, good luck there, Tracy
I know.
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
Thanks for everything.
I can't wait to start campaigning.
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
What do you mean?
Hello, Mr. M.
So what brings you here?
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Plenty of pep, too.
So Tracy?
Yes?
Why are you doing this?
Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.
What's this?
I want you to do something for me.
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
What a surprise.
You'll be fine.
I hope so
Jim, where the hell have you been?
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Uh, Jim?
Hmm?
Walt needs to see you.
You wanted to see me, Mr. M.?
Okay.  But is this about the posters?
I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
I did it.
And when did you do it?
This weekend.
Exactly when?
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
Door was open.
I don't believe you.
More this way.
Should we get a what?
points at the motel.
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Still clear?
Three twenty-five.
What do you want, Jim?
You're there.
Yeah.  I'm here.
Sherry... I love you.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
A mistake?  That was no mistake.
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
Okay, let's say
And 290 "disregards," right?
Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
Where 're you going?
I'm not like you.
Are you crazy?
But other people can see them too.
I don't care.
Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
We can't both run, can we?  We're brother and sister.  Can we?
I mean at you.
We still have some extra ones, don't we?  Maybe we can just --
It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
Who put you up to this?
Who put you up to this?
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Hell, good luck!
Paul, will you sign my yearbook?
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
You dumbshit!
How's the left these days?
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
That obvious, huh?
Somebody hit you?
Can I get you a drink?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
Tell me about Patchett.
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
You say 'fuck' a lot.
Yeah.
Do you enjoy it?
When they deserve it.
Did they deserve it today?
I'm not sure.
So you saved her.
Come in out of the rain, Bud.
So tell me about it.
Captain, what do you want?
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
Will you work for me?
Of course... But how?
Give me one minute.
Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
Let my daughter rest in peace.
Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.
Stens?  Was it Stens?
Maybe.  I don't know.
What's through here?
Was it... a rat?
One in six.  Where's the girl?
How's it going to look on your report?
It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
Why?
Lynn.
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
Let's just kill them.
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
Ellis Loew.
You wanted to meet here?
You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
She's fine.
Richard Stensland.
I don't know him.  Mr...
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
Wendell White, how's tricks, <u>paesano</u>?
More.
Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
What do you want to know?
Whose shoe?
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
More or less.
Anything?
Where are the police academy files?
I don't have time.  I have --
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
I never truck with no sissies!
I heard you like to shoot dogs.
Dogs got no reason to live.
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
Man, what're you saying?
Ray, we got the shotguns.
What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
But you were business associates?
And?
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.
The youngest applicant by eight years.
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
Dudley, we've been over this.
Answer yes or no.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.
Ed, I want confessions.
No... Where'd the tip come from?
<u>No</u>.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
You're the key witness?
<u>Throwing me</u>?
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
L.A.P.D.
Damnit...
Glasses.
I want you to follow Bud White.
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
You make a mistake?
Listen, I think I made a mistake, too.
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
What?
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
She is Lana Turner.
What?
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
I get the idea.  You got a description?
The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering you about the case?
A vulgar term, but yes.
What's her name?
Lynn Bracken.
Why's she seeing Bud White?
No.
I'm curious about you.
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
You, me and White, huh?
Right now, before I back down.
Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
It seems like my Susan, but...
Let my Susie rest in peace!
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
Officer White?
A sweet man.
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
Jack!  It's Christmas!
You're back, boychick.
Sid, how are they hanging?
What's he doing here, Sid?
Where'd you hear that?
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
Shut up!
What's wrong, Trash?
No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
Have we met before?
And no one'll know about this?
It'll be our secret.
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
Oh?  Anyplace else?
DePinto's dead.
I don't know anything about Zavitz.
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
Yes.
Nothing.
What'd he give to you?
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
It's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator.
Listen to me--
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
You've got it on tape?
No one. But I'm a little nervous.
When can you get it here?
I'm doing a transfer now.
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
I'll come straight there.
Tell us about Rachel Banks.
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
Really?
You knew the deal. No contact.
Who are they?
What do they have to do with this?
That's who they are.
The NSA?
Yes.
You're crazy.
Okay.
What <u>is</u> that?
It's a SAT-tracker.
They're spooks.
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
And you won't. Now move--
I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
Did you call anyone?
What do you mean?
I mean did you call anyone.
Look, my wife is understandably--
Jesus!
I called my wife!
What'd I tell you?
I didn't use my name.
What'd I tell you?
I called from a payphone!
What'd I tell you?
You told me no calls.
How do you know so much?
None of your business.
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
I intercepted phone calls.
What do you think?
That is one ugly sunrise.
It really is.  Did you find anything?
Yeah.
The NSA killed him.
What's going on?
They're here.
Who?
Them.
Where?
Here?
What the fuck?!
Gimme that.
You sure?
You're driving.
Think we let out enough air?
We lost 'em.
That wasn't so hard.
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
These guys are incredibly persistent.
Drive.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
No he won't.
What about newspapers and magazines?
Same thing?
What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
What if--
What if <u>what</u>?
Reynolds.
No.
You wanna get caught spying on Albert?
Feeling lucky?
Baudmore Consultants.
Is Jerry Delsano in?
The thing is...it really can't wait.
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
Law enforcement?
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...
Hi, Mr. Dean.
Is it okay?
Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
Do you see anything you like?
I'm married.
Yes. I have her permission.
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
Can you help me?
How 'bout Christian Dior?
Is that good?
It's a little late for that.
I'll say.
Pardon?
What size?
Eight.  Size eight.
I'll be right back.
Thanks.
Remain calm.
I think she'll like this very much.
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
That's my point.
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
Your stuff?
A report?
A police report.
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
About what?
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
What kind of trouble.
You tell me.
I can't.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
I'm not his attorney.
Than why can't you tell me.
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
Somebody took my blender.
Did he give you anything?
No.
Anything at all?
No, sir.
Was he with anyone?
Not that I could see.
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
No.
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
To buy lingerie.
Uh-oh.
Right.
Something bad happened tonight.
What?
I saw a man die.
Bobby?
What do you mean?
Who did you work with to get the--
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
No.
Sorry.
Well, you know--
How could you let me find out like this?
Robert--
I see her for business.
It's not real...  That's not me.
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
Stacy--
Stacy, don't hang up.
I know, but listen--
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
Does that hurt?
Well...yeah.
Good.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
You opened the thing?
That was for Christmas.
...who root through...uh...presents, and...
What is it?
Are you sure you're safe?
They're saying you killed that policeman.
Is it over?
It's really over?
Albert's gonna get me my job back.
I'm sorry, sir, this card's been declined.
Maybe it's not connected yet.
My suitcase--
Sir?
Is this a fuckin' joke?
I don't believe it is, no.
That ain't me.
It's not?
You don't know who the fuck--
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
Actually, that's not true.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
How's the trout?
It tastes like fish.
Do you like fish?
DePinto?
Brill.
"Soon". Or at least sooner than never.
It's how he works.
Brill?
Yes.
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
Other than Brill.
Other than me.
You're not.
How can I be sure.
Good. You're just what I need right now.
Who's doing this?
I gotta go.
You being audited?
For the last four years.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
That's temporary.
Bullshit.
Rachel--
We're screwed.
I'm gonna fix it.
How?
I can't.
You have to.
I've never met him?
I <u>did</u> care how.
I'm sorry about that.
What makes you think it's you?
It's not me?
He didn't.
We believe he did.
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
--otherwise we may have to--
We'd rather not--
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
We'd rather not--
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
My shoe?
Seat 74.
What's his name?
Who would do that?
A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
Bobby--
Robert--
She doesn't want to talk to you.
Are those my Christmas presents?
Some of 'em.
Can I open 'em up?
Sure, go ahead.
Really?
Dad!
He's kidding.
Where's mom?
Do I know you?
How long can you stay?
Alright!
Did they take your clothes?
No.
Usually they take clothes.
The blender?
I love my blender.
They didn't take the silverware?
No, but they took my blender.
What?
They only took electrical appliances.
He's heard that it's escalated.
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
Jerry--
Christ!
Ssh!
Calm down.
They killed Rachel.
Rachel's dead?
Bobby--
They're framing me.
Why would they--
I don't know. I mean--
I don't know!
You're tired.
Jerry--
Listen to me.
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
Go to 'em, Jerry.
I have a family.
I'm sorry, man.
Bobby? Piece of advice?
Yeah?
Turn yourself in.
Jerry?
Yeah?
Bobby--
I need help.
How can I reach you?
Are you okay?
Are you still in Crystal City?
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
He got hit by a bus.
What does that have to do with you?
Was Zavitz in trouble?
You think there was a connection to--
You would?
Yes. But we can't.
Yes sir.
What the hell does it mean?
Fuck you.
What?
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
What about the tapes?
We found the originals.
The originals?
There was a transfer.
We'd have to--
He had help.
He's clever. He had help.
We believe?
Lyle?!
Yes sir.
You're kidding me.
Dean's with Lyle.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
So they know everything.
If they've looked at the video.
Oh, let's assume that they have.
What about--
We don't know.
Yes?
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
How'd you get in the building?
Yes?
Puffed cheese?
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
No.
Then let's assume I don't.
Now is that clear?
How much did you pay?
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
Which stall?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
I don't want to go back.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
I don't care to bargain.
Why did you follow me yesterday?
You felt obliged to.
He said - be careful.
Actually, you sing.
Pardon?
You sing.  All the time.
I thought you might paste them into your book.
We took several photographs, there's no need.
You should come into the shelter.
What am I looking at?
See what's happening to them - the stars.
No.
Shall we be all right?
And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
Do they know them?
Will you not come in?
No.
Will you please come in?
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
I'm impressed you can sew.
Good.
You sew very badly.
When were you most happy?
Now.
When were you least happy?
What do you hate most?
A lie.  What do you hate most?
Say you're sick.
I can still taste you.
It's a folk song.
Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
Shall we be all right?
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
Dance with me.
Katharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?
Why did he bring you?
Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
We've got to get you out of here.
It hurts too much.
Why did you hate me?
Shall we be all right?
Yes.  Absolutely.
And a good read.  Don't waste it.
I'm sorry, Katharine.
A broken car?
Safe journey.
Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
Have you seen Katharine?
What?
It's Geoffrey under this.
Could I trouble you for some water?
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
Her hands and feet were tied.
And where are the Expedition Maps?
Look, either shut up, or go home.
When's Clifton picking you up?
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
How are you?
Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
Is this you?
It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
Don't cut me.
Or was it Toronto?
Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.
Buon' Giorno! Hana turns, startled and suspicious.
Are you Hana?
You were in Africa?
Yeah, for a while.
Supper. Hana calls after him.
Where've you been?
Who are his ghosts?
What if I told you he did this to me?
Where did you find that?
I liberated it.
She can take you as far as Florence.
Thief, I think, is more accurate.
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
Thought you'd never wake up!
For?
Have a drink.
What did you say?
You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
The team is in mourning, darling.
I'm fine.  I got hot.
Lady H said she thought you might be -
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
Candaules
Candaulesyou're laughing at me.
Are you asleep?
I can already see.
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
I can see my wife in that view.
Are you remembering more?
Could I have a cigarette?
Why?  Can he lay eggs?
He needn't disturb you.
Excuse me -
Well then - yes.  Of course.
I'll probably marry him.
Why?  Is he staying?
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
Good morning.  Did you know that?  You're always singing?
I've been told that before.
Hey! -
I'm still here.
Why don't you go?  You should sleep.
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
No!
I'm not sewing anything else for you!
I've met you before.
For my hair?
So I follow the wires?
No. But he hands them over.
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
Kip - come and dance with me
I try not to expect you.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
This is hot!
Of course.  When?
I mean home.  India.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
I'll always go back to that church.
The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
He's gone, hasn't he?
No.  He's - no.
Hello.
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
Only we have to go to work.
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
Does he have to go?
Whoa - give me a chance!
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
A bit of one.
I was looking forward to this evening.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
Go away.
Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women.
Darling, Peter says I could stay
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
This is wonderful!
Why?  Are you German?
This was your garden?
Or my wife's.
You didn't answer the beeper either.
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
Through a window.
So he popped the pane?
You ordering chop suey again?
You got a better idea?
We've got to catch him in the act.
Why didn't I think of that?
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
We're getting close.
How close?
Where are you at least?
Gin? Where the hell are you?
He's on to something bigger.
I have a question...
Who am I?
Why are we speaking Chinese?
No you can't.
I can't?
How about if I try humility.
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
Then don't.
You have a car?
Uh, yes.
Seems I am.
I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.
Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
I've got something...
You're not taking me seriously.
So what?
You're shaking. Are you nervous?
I've got something for you.
And I thought we were getting on so well.
But Roki said--
Maybe I should drive this time.
Very nice.
You want me to pick up a painting?
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
It's a test.
It's a fake.
Give him the card.
But--
He says they turned the card down.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
Motorcycle.
It's one way.
Those are my clothes.
You stole my luggage? You--
I'm a thief. Sue me.
I don't believe this.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
You're late.
And good morning.
Good morning.
I know it well.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
That's because I wanted them to!
The Rembrandt--that was quite good.
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
On what? Another job?
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
So you're testing <u>me</u> now?
Why don't we take oxygen?
Let's do it again.
Did I hear a car?
Our equipment has arrived.
I didn't mean to get personal.
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
A dozen times.
Charged?
That's it. We're ready.
I trust it's your size.
Thank you.
No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village.
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
Aren't we early?
To us. To the Mask.
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
Camera in the--
Bookshelf. Sensors--
We're working.
It's a party.
One, two, three...
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
Ready?
Can you see the other PIRs?
They moved it.
Careful...careful.
We did it.
Okay, you're a thief.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
It's your mistake.
The big job.
Your share.
We're living history here.
I like banks.  That's where the money is.
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
You've got everything planned.
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
Oh my god, I thought--
What about the rules?
Well...What are we doing?
The eight billion. From them to us.
Peoples China Bank.
The oscilloscope's already programmed.
That's where the Mask comes in.
So how long till we do this?
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
There's always a surprise.
How do I look?
Pulse detectors.
Charged.
Parachute.
No way to take another day or two?
You shouldn't have.
You have something in mind?
That was a lifetime ago.
It was wrong to deceive you.
But would you--would you--
Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.
So what are you going to do with your share?
Oh, I don't care about the money.
Four billion dollars.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
Not for me.
The sign of our partnership.
China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
Relax, don't jam it...
MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F...
The disc is still in there.
The door's the only way out!
Jesus.
Come on.
No way.
Hang on.
I cannot get rid of you.
Put this on!
--You're a cop.
You gave them the eight billion.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
Which is--
In the van.
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
This is big enough.
Right.
I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.
Oh, it is.
I said a masked ball, not a costume party.
It's too soon.
The early bird gets the damn worm.
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
Remind me why.
You two make quite a couple.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
Suspicious, after all these years?
Tonight your league night?
This is just show and tell.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
She's calling the shots now.
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
You know where my loyalties lie.
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
You're giving them to me?
Call it an expression of trust.
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
See you.
Probably not.
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
What the hell is this doing here?
Fax these to this number, okay?
All of 'em?
There's more than one?
What?  Hey -- <u>he</u> hit <u>me</u>.
Hi.  Donna Irving?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
This is a real nice place you got here.
Wow.  Why would they do that?
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
The judge came up with a number.
Five million dollars?
I can put them in a good school.
Any school you want.
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
I never lied.  I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
All I have is hundreds.
Where's Anna?
You do know how to do that, don't you?
You're a girl.
Course I did.
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
And you can't?
Then I don't get anything either.
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
It's not about working hard --
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
How many families we talking about here?
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.
You wanna talk about --
No shit.
Oh, they knew.  They had to know.
I like this case.
Hey.  I like working with you.
If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.
D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
Someone's following me.
What kind of truck?
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
Whoa.  No shit.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
Because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>!
Not in my world.
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.
Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
Look, this is serious now.  They're talking serious money --
How dare you take that away from me.
Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
Fuck Kurt.
Morning!
I don't know what to say.
Say you were wrong.
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
You see your office?
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
Here what comes?
The extortion, the threats ...
When'd they file the demur?
Who's the judge?
Corey.
Did he say why?
Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
You come to the right place.
Pattee?  That your middle name?
Nope.  Maiden.
What kind of chromium is it?
So that stuff -- it kills people.
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
Have you been to the water board?
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
Mommy, can I get a flower?
What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?
I don't know.
What's going on in there?
Some meeting.  With PG&E people.
Hey, Ros, where are they?
Can I play roller hockey?
We'll see.
Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no holes in my research.
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Annabelle Daniels.
Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here --
You want my number?
I do.
Which number do you want, George?
C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
Cause I don't even know you.
Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
What're you doing?
What are you doing here?
Great.
No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George.
That's Ed.
Lock the door.
That is not what I'm --
Thinking.
About this.
More than you need me.
You already packed up your stuff?
Thank you.
Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.
I'm embarrassed.
Someone stole my stuff.
Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
Yes.  It's called accountability.
Where's my paycheck?
Have you been logging on?
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
There's something else, too.
I know.  It's an awful lot.
You're moving away?  When?
Dr. Paulsen?
Who's Baxter?
It was .... the Emperor ....
My lord.
Soon, Lord Vader.
He will learn patience.
Much anger in him, like in his father.
Will he finish what he begins?
Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.
The boy is our last hope.
I can't ...
You must survive, Luke.
Ben ... Ben ...
... Luke, you must not go.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
Growls a reserved greeting.
Barks a blue streak.
Three patrol ships are heading our way.
Well, it's been awhile.
Barks his concern.
Barks at his master.
Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
Give me that!
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
... I told you, I'm not hungry.
Because of my father, I guess.
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
The temperature is dropping too fast.
What is thy bidding, My Master?
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
Sir, I was wondering ...
Sit down, and shut up!
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
Han, we need you here.
We?
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
An Imperial probe droid.
I don't know what he's talking about.
Would it help if I got out and pushed?
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
I take it back.
We've got to get out of this shower.
What is it?
You don't look angry.
How do I look?
Well, I hope you don't expect more.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
Stop that.
You mean a man you can control.
There's something out there!
Where?
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
I see it Chewie, hang on.
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
That depends.  Where are we?
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
What are you staring at?
Who's staring?
You look silly.
You look great.
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
Thanks to you.
I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
No hard feelings?
Are you kidding?
All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.
Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
What'd you say?
Luke!
The deflector shields are gone.
The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
Closer?!
What??
Rather touchy, aren't they.
Where are you going?
I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about Han.
Leia!
This hyperdrive had better work.
I have followed my feelings.
I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
I don't believe it.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
Four this time!  The Force you feel.
What's in there?
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
I'll die first.
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
It won't get through the blockade.
Good God.
My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
Nobody's going to believe it.
Believe what?
Zira, are you mad?
To a lot of psychiatric small talk --
And we can watch ...
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
What are they doing here?
Go easy, Stevie.
They look pretty docile.
We shall want a full autopsy ...
Humans?
Please
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
Who's that?
He doesn't look like his picture.  I bet he's fake.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
Where's Plissken?
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
I need a favor.
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
Don't lie to me.
All right, so I made another deal.
I'm already dead.
Dream on, blue eye.
I don't know, sounds thin to me.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
See you in hell, Snake.
She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
Shut up, Plissken.
What's the little black box do?
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
Not you?
No.
She's in the green.
Lock fuel rods.
Locked.
Plissken...?
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
Getting ready to invade.
Stop the damn car.
No way.
Where is it?
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
Me too?
Aw, come on, Snake.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
What're you doing in here?
Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
No screamin' shit.
Don't follow me.
You need help.
This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!
How do we get out of here?
What the hell is this?
What are you gonna do in Venice?
Run, Snake...They're coming.
I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
Well, I'll think it over.
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
Where's the anti-toxin...?
I'm looking for somebody.
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
Yield. I have the advantage.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
But your life and lands are far from here.
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
He can be no other.
Who is Merlin?
But not from your destiny.
I want to thank you.
Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--
It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--
How? Where?
In the great book.
What?!
A king must marry, after all.
Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then.
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives.
Father...
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
I left it in the tent, sir.
You freed it, son?
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself.
I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here.
Who does it serve?
No.
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
There is one.
Who?!
You.
Yes. I would swear my love to you.
The law forbids it.
There are things about love--
Why didn't he kill us?
Just a man. A knight in the King's service.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
I showed you all my conjuring tricks...
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
They do.
What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it.
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
I swear it. By Excalibur and the holy--
Now you must pay me.
The oath. You didn't say--
It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child.
Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
Well why are they tearing the building down?
What honey?
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
What's he doing there? Teaching?
No, he's working on another book.
Hello?
Hi
Here.
Oh great, anything else?
What's this?
Just five or six people.
Maybe the circuit is busy?
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
What didn't he tell you?
Didn't who tell me?
What did the doctor say?
Oh Burke! Poor Burke!
Where do you want this?
What is it?
Phonograph.
No, she was heavily sedated.
It's serious?
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
May I ask...?
No. Not at all,
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
Oh, I see.
Want to ask him?
Oh, she'd love it.
Rats?
But it's clean?
No. No rats.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
Bastard! I will kill you.
Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
Excuse me Miss?
What!
A man to see you.
Morning.
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
How are you today?
Fine thank you.
Is it coming out Willie?
Why the math?
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
You're kidding! Like what?
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
Hey, come on, I'm grown-up. What'd she say? I mean specifically, Doctor.
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
Chris MacNeil?
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
Where?
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
Yes am.
Pretty close?
Sure did.
About my daughter?
No I didn't know you had one.
He didn't mention?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
He didn't mention her.
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
That depends.
On what?
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
No, you don't understand. Your daughter-
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
Did you know my mother died recently?
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
No, is Regan aware of it?
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
Wanna drink.
No it's alright I'll take it straight.
Are you sure?
Where's Regan's father?
In Europe.
No
She...killed Burke Dennings.
Yes. He's already here.
Is she gonna die?
What did you do today?
Um........Stuff.
We'll see when we get home okay.
When can I have one?
Oh look at that.
You like it?
Hey, where'd this come from?
I found it.
You've been playing with it?
Yeah.
You know how?
Wait a minute you need two.
No you don't. I do it all the time.
Captain who?
Captain Howdy.
Oh, Captain Howdy....
Oh I bet he is.
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
Regan, why are you reading that?
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
Mr. Dennings?
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
Oh you did. What did you hear?
I don't know, I just thought.
Well your thinking's not so good.
Why does God let us get tired?
What are you doing here?
Oh my God!
I don't want it.
All done.
Honey this is Father Dyer.
Damien Karras.
Hi Chris. Great party.
She doesn't remeber a thing.
Goodbye Father. I call you.
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal? The poor box?
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
Where'd you get it then?
Think you can sleep?
Goodnight Dims.
Lieutenant?
I came to say goodbye.
You just missed them.
How's the girl?
Do you like films?
What's playing.
Withering Heights.
I've seen it.
Another one. Had your lunch?
You might loosen the straps then.
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
Where's Regan?
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
It would bring us together.
You and Regan?
Did you do that?
Do it again.
In time.
You speak Latin?
Ego te abslovo.
Quod nomen mihi est?
Bon Jour.
Quod nomen mihi est?
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
What's that?
I'm all right.
Oh really, when?
Is that too tight?
Dimmy, you worry for something?
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
Let the enemy have no power over her.
And let my cry come unto thee.
The Lord be with you.
Amen
Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The reponse please Damien!
And let my cry come unto thee.
The Lord be with you.
What is it?
Her heart.
Can you give her something?
You're not my mother!!!
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.
Really?
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
And Dennings, you read how he died?
It's possible. Possible however
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
I don't know anyone who fits the description.
Is that a threat?
Hey, Father? You like movies?
Come on!
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
MERRIN!!!!!!!
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
Fuck him!!!
...Be gone!!
Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!
Miss?
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Do you have an appointment?
Yes
Are you a relative?
Are you comfortable Regan?
Yes.
How old are you?
Twelve.
Is there someone inside you?
Sometimes.
Who is it?
I don't know.
Is it Captain Howdy?
No.
Why not?
Give me the keys.
You're not going to drive.
Give me the keys!
You're not going to drive!
It's my goddamn car!
It's our goddamn car!
Give me the keys.
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Little slow tonight.
Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.
Take it now.
What about tomorrow?
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
Trunks?
Swimming trunks.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
We have some lotion.
Just the same.
Well, look at this.
Beasley.
Baker.
What's our friend's problem?
What's wrong with them?
They gotta go.
No bones?
Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
You the magician?
No.
Piano.
Oh.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!
How's the birthday girl?
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
Out.
What's the gig?
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
How we doing?
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
Am I late?
Jack.
Frank.
Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Don't make trouble, all right?
Count it.
Huh?
Count it.
Jack...
Fuck him.
I hate your kids, Frank.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
What d'ya got?,
Bosen black.  Flat.
What d'ya got?
What do you think?
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
You look awful.
Thanks.
Really.  You sleeping?
Only on odd days.
Seeing anyone in particular?
I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
Funny.  Strike a bell?
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
No thanks.
No, I mean it.
So do I.
This time you gotta go.
You gotta go.
Says who?
So what'd we get her?
I made her nervous.
What do you mean?
What's with Charlie?
Yeah?
It's me.
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
It's not family.  It's business.
We don't get a gig.
So you'll come out, right?
Jack.
Nice, huh?
What?
The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
I don't know what you mean.
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
It wasn't like that.
No?
No.
Yeah, and what put him up there?
That's what we agreed.
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.
Jack.
Let's get it over with.
You're getting cold feet about this.
What's the matter?
I'll drop the eighths.
Where the hell is she?
Get out of here.
Come on, stand still.
Get out of here!
It's not gonna hurt you.
All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
No.
See anything?
Something, huh?  All those bids.
Yeah.  Something.
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
You all right?
Hey, Frank.
You recognized me.
Just a lucky guess.
So what do you think?
November.  '71.
First night?
Last?
She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
He's drunk.
Have some more wine, Frank.
Right.
Unless you want the right.
You leaving that on?
Yeah.
All night?
Yeah.  You mind?
Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean.
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
Right.  I love you, Frank.
How dare you say you love me.
They stopped serving two hours ago.
Two hours ago!
You haven't seen Susie, have you?
Funny, huh?
What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
You saw wrong.
He's with the hotel.  I called him.
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
What're you doing down here?
Celebrating.  Join me?
February?
He was just having fun.
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
I could've.  But he didn't want me to.
I can't make the tenth.
What're you doing?
Just until we find another girl.
We're not getting paid then.
No.
What's it for?
I don't know. Some disease.
What disease?
I don't know.
What channels it on?
Seventy-one
We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
Jack, you're on television.
I didn't hear you come in.
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
Charlie called.
Five years ago.  November.
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
Spur of the moment.
So what'd you think?
Thrilling.  Both of you.
No, no.  You boys are tired.
You sure?
Your limo's ready, Ma.
Sick?  How sick?
The flu.
So she's got a few sniffles.
You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
Actually, that's my stage name.
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
Uh... he knows it.
Yes, it is.
This is where the auditions were.
What do you mean?
We're finished.
You're an hour and a half late.
My watch is broken, too.
Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
Don't take it personally.
How should I take it?
You're an hour and a half late.
So run a little longer.
Miss --
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
I sing now?
So?
When?
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
What I mean is --
Where's my name?
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
Changed?
Where's your dress?
Do I look like I'm naked?
That!  You can't wear that!
It's orange!
Come on.
Come on.  We don't have much time.
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
I wear a seven.
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Nine.
Nine?
Nine!
What do you think?
Uh... good.
Shoes?
They're tight.
They're nines.
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Right.
The switch.  Hit the switch.
I said I was sorry.
Give me that.
Maybe it's legit.
Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.
Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
You two could play checkers.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
You play all these places?
Virgins.
Go ahead.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Great.
Great?
You're kidding me.
As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
Peggy Lee?
They must've bought the same map we did.
What do you say we send a bottle over?
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
Huh?
I can't sing it anymore.
That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
Yes, well, they are.
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
Is that important?
Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.
Whatcha doin' over there?
Gotta go.
How come?
Funny hours.
Funny job.
Barker.  Jock Barker?
Baker.  Jack Baker.
Right.  Bring him back.
He doesn't bite.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
Baker.
Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
Yeah.
All right.  Hold on.
The name's Baker --
Save it.  What's he look like?
It went well tonight.
Frank works hard.
And you don't?
He leads, I follow.
Is that the way it is?
You miss him, don't you?
It's been a long time, Ma.
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
You never sang before?
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
Where's egghead?
Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir.
Forget it.
He do that every year?
Every year.
Aren't the kids asleep?
Every year.
So why's he do it?
It's okay.  Last one.
Can't sleep?
It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
How's egghead?
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
Relax.  We'll drop the song.
Guess I got a little scattered.
I can keep the beat.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
What'd I say?
Nothing.
You're upset.
I'm not upset.
All I said was you were good.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
You were good.
You were good.
Nina?
Who's Nina?
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
Must've been a cheap date.
Soap convention.
History.
The both of them?  In there?
He had a mind that escalated things.
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
Frank said ---
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Coffee?
Yeah... No.
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
You can always get another girl.
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
So ... ?
You don't pick your brother.
What kind?
Huh?
Jack.
Let me get the light.
Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Another five years, huh?
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
Did you break a cup, Jack?
Guess they're up.
Is that what you used to do?
What are they?
How do you know?
Oh?
I guess it's getting serious.
Ivory.
Looks old.
Older than me.
What's a prom?
How'd the show go?
Okay.  How'd yours go?
Jack.
Merry Christmas, Jack.
John.  It's good to see you.
So. How are you?
Fine.  You?
Big piece or little?
Huh? Oh, no.
None?
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
Fine work, Jon.
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
Jesus Christ, Castor.
Where am I?
Perfect fit.
Nice-looking kid.
Or reactivated the first one.
You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
A few blanks?  Like what?
After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me.
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
That's not the worst part.
Thanks, Pollux.
For what?
For being one helluva guy.
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
We need to talk.
I'm late for surgery.
Must've been after we got engaged.
No.
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
I took it from my fake husband.
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
What more proof do you need?
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
Would it?
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.
-- Castor?
Not anymore.
What -- what are you doing?
Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.
Jamie ...
You'll what?
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
SFPD?  Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
Clarissa left those here.
You mean like ... condoms?
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
Kim?
That's your name, isn't it?
You've got someone in your office.
Get rid of them.
What happened?
Commander, what are you doing here?
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
I'm just having some fun.
Eight pocket stingers ... seven piper uzis ... six cobra carbines ...  five - net - launch-ers ...
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
You'll need to recultivate that virus.
A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
You're the only person in this place who can see right through me.
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
What happened to your big "assignment"?
What do you know about it?
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
I'm not going anywhere.
You're wearing your suit --
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Oh, that Karl.
What are you doing?
I'll deal with her later.
Oh, and Oxxford called...
Her assistant?
You have kids, Jack?
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
Thats right. And auto supply...
Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
And I know people.
Take you, for instance...
Jack, are you okay?
But I think I like you better this way...
Mom, dont you think we need to open the presents?
Were almost done here...
Fightings a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
Wheres my real dad?
They did a pretty good job.
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
Do you like kids?
You know how to make chocolate milk?
Got it.  Good tip.
Where do I go now?
Big Eds?  Big Eds Tires?  Why...?
One year he had a solar system named after her...
Very nice. What is it?
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
What are you doing?
Is it morning yet?
Im having kind of a bad day.
Is it...?
Trouble at work?
I dont think so.
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
Im telling you, those rules dont apply to me, Arn.
So Jack, its your wifes birthday, got anything to say to her?
Hey, you cant park that thing here.
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
Yes, thats it...yes, we went to high school together.
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
Wheres my car?!  Wheres my Ferrari!?
What the hell are you talking about?  Whats he talking about?
DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
No.
Like I said, it's a business deal...
How'd you know my name was Jack?
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
Yeah?  What do you need?
You just said everyone needs something.
You still think this is about me, don't you?
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
Whats this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?
Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.
What!?  Look at the ticket...!
You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!
Like the dress...?
Something like that.
Need a nurse?
Are we...?
Are we what, Jack?
Are we finally being honest?
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
No, I didnt...thats great.
Here we are, mag wheels...  Hey Jack, are you sure youre okay?
Kates on two, Jack.  Nice ride...
If youre into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.
You mean dont go at all? What about my internship?
Go. Im sorry, you should just go...
No, youre right.  What are we doing?
I can't seem to let go of you...
Are you okay?
Where were you?
I was in the city.
The city?  New York City?  Why?
Because thats where I live.
Why not?
Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?
Here you go...
Youre kidding me...
Shes your dog, Jack.
...my feet are hurtin...
Uh...that babys crying...
Wait a second.  You want me, dont you?
No, Im serious...youre really stunning...
How can you do that?
$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?
I think it worked out okay, dont you?
Sure.  I really like Annie.
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didnt we?
Our life in a nutshell...
If you want to look at it that way...
You want the cake!?
Thank you...
Say it, Jack...
Cmon, you know what I like to hear...
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Nice, Jack.  Youre sweeping me off my feet.
Maybe I should wait...
You really are incredible...
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
And now...?
Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
Good things...
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
Im out of the doghouse?
My god, all this time...I never stopped loving you...
Pretty incredible, isnt it?
Think bigger.
This place is a perk, Kate.
Im talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
Its been interesting, thats for sure.
But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
I promise, Jack...
Promise me again...
You look great.
I'm sorry...
So youre not at a non- profit firm?
Not with what they pay me...
You cant go!
Jesus, Jack...
Dont do this, Jack... But he continues...
Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
I need you, tiger..
Where is he?
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Peter Lassiter...
...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
He certainly has your number, Alan.
For one thing, you like expensive things.
Can I help you?
Damn...damn...damn...
No...Im not...
Of course I did.
I want to see you again.
I'd like that, too.
Don't you have anywhere to go?
Thats totally see through...
Merry Christmas...
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
I wouldn't know anything about that.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
How'd you know it was me?
I'm not really dressed for a party.
We're going to have to work on your touch.
I can't take this.
What about his first born?
He <u>knew</u> about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down --
I had it at four.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
I don't know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --
What the --!
Ben.  Are you okay?
We had a tough year.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
We're working as hard as we can --
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
'Course not.  Strictly business.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Reed? ... Sue?
Hey!  That's a <u>prototype</u>!
The machine works.  And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
Deb... It's me.  I need you to step out front.
What did you wish for, honey?
What are <u>you</u> doing here?
I'm worried about you.
Ben, come in.
What is this?  Where's Reed?
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
You look like an eighties rock band.
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
He didn't.
Oh, he did.
He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
<u>Where is Reed</u>?
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
He's not responsive --
Now what is up with <i>that</i>?
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
Back it down, Johnny!
Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.
But all these people...
You're hot!
So are you!
Me like-y.
I though we went over this.
You're on fire!
Not this again --
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Apparently I can disappear.
Stop it.
What is that <i>thing</i>?
Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
You're really cramping my style here.
I'm driving.
You two need a time-out.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
They're ready for you, sir.
Leonard, how's the feed?
Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Come on, Ben, come on...
Ben did this.
Didn't go as <u>planned</u>?  It was a <u>catastrophe</u>.  You ruined the lives of four people --
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Yes, thanks.
Which was?
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
What?  What do you mean you --
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
That's what we're here to find out.
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
But <u>we're</u> the focus, right Reed? <u>Reed</u>...?
And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
I can...make it work.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
I found a broken gasket, from space --
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
Raising the shields.
What's going on?
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
He's working round the clock.  But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
Please don't make this personal --
Oh, I think you already have.
Where do we stand?
Okay to proceed.
They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
I told you to cut down on the sugar.
Now how soon can we try Sodium Pentathol?
I'd hold that off awhile.
Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.
Benes... What the devil happened?
The Other Side got to him.
How bad off is he?
-- and why we need you.
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
His technician okay? In addition to the Looks Department?
<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
And take a little trip with them...
You mean <I'm> going along?
As part of the Crew.
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
Just one, General...
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]
Listen...the Heart.
We must!
Doctor...
Yes, Cora.
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
We're pushing oxygen today.
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
-- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock.
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
Then how come it worked loose?
Shouldn't you answer that?
Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
No need to get up --
Thank you for saving my life.
That's what they pay me for.
Such as?
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
What can we do?
I've done all I could with the laser.
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
You left something out.
What's that?
You mean Inner Space is endless?
Don't tell me they're refueling...
Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
You said there was a quick way out!
What about Dr. Michaels?
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
Tell them to take us out.
If there's any chance --
Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --
All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
You have no right to blame Duval --
You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
Two in a row?
We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.
Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.
They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution.
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
I can't tell you.
May I?
I'm married.
Sort of.
Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
'Prepare for Miniaturization'...
What happened?
Come on -- it's no use!
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
How's it look?
That's it...
I'll never find my way through that.
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
Then don't drift down further.
Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
...What do you mean, you decided not to park here?
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
Drop that fucking money!
No Jean, no money!
...Is this a fucking joke?
This is a new car, then, sir?
I don't know. Few munce.
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
Or your fucking wife, you know.
Where is Pancakes Hause?
What?
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
Clear him off the road.
She started shrieking, you know.
...So I guess that's it, then.  Here's the keys -
No, that's not it, Jerry.
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
Personal matters.
...Who's Jean?
...Blood has been shed.
What the heck d'ya mean?
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
...The heck d'ya mean?
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
Oh, yah, I know that!
Oh, now he's adorable.
Oh, he's adorable.
Yah, he -
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
Oh, don't be silly.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
How ya doin'?
Mr. Mohra?
Yah.
What'd this guy look like anyways?
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
Uh-huh - in what way?
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
Yah, got a front movin' in.
Hiya, Norm. How ya doin', Margie? How's the fricassee?
Uh-huh... A what?
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
Uh-huh.
Where you girls from?
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
Can you be any more specific?
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.
Uh-huh.
A subconscious-type thing.
Yah, that can happen.
I'm talkin' about your potential.
Uh-huh.
You're not a C student.
Uh-huh.
Yah, right -
Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
Yah.
Mr. Lundegaard?
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
...Mr. Lundegaard?
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
but do you know that for sure without -
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
Sir? Right now?
Hon? Got the growshries.
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
Okay.
Well... yah.

Yep.
Anyone else residing there?
Yah, is this Marge?
Yah?
Margie Olmstead?
No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd.
His wife?
Linda.
No.
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
The day of our homicides.
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
Gustafson's accountant.
- looking.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Still missing. We're looking.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Copy.

Whose car?
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!

Copy. Yah, send me back-up!

They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Yah, okay. How's the hotel?
Oh, fine.
Not on your feet too much?
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
They announced it?
...So?
Three-cent stamp.
Your mallard?
Yah.
It's just the three cent.
Yah, I guess.
I love you, Margie.
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
This is do-able.
He's at Norstar.
I'm tellin' ya.
That wouldn't interest you.
Where's Tyler?
The first rule of Project --
I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?
You are a moron.
Cornelius!  How are you?
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
Better than I've ever been in my life.
No.  I found something new.
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
You are?!
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.
You need to make these your primary "action items."
Have you finished those reports?
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
Does this sound strange to you?
The dynamite...
What does that mean?
It means it was homemade.
Who do you think could've done this?
No, you can't die of insomnia.
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
You need to lighten up.
Can't you give me something?
We need to talk.
And I saw you practicing this...
I'll expose you.
Why are you doing this?
It becomes an addiction.
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
You're kidding.
I want that.
You can't have the whole brain!
So far, you have four and I only have two!
That's your favorite, too?  Tried to slip it by me, eh?
Looks like this is goodbye.
That's the idea -- we split them.
You haven't been going to yours.
I found a new one.
Really?
It's for men.
Like testicular cancer?
This could go on for hours.
What are you doing here?
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
I don't know ...
No, thanks.
Where?  Here?
Here.
There?
Here.
Here.
Feel anything?
Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
You feel nothing?
Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.
No... no problem.
I think everything's okay here.
I could check your prostate.
Uh ... nah.
You... don't have to... leave.
When?
Do you care?
You hear that?
Hear what?
What is this?  Who did this?
... A person.
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Why would you get bent if I asked?
Let go of me...  Leave me alone.
The Paper Street Soap Company.
Can I come in?
He's not here.
Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we ever had sex?
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Is this a trick?
We did make love?
Is that what you're calling it?
We've just lost cabin pressure.
What did you say... ?
What is wrong with you?
Say my name.
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
You are an insane person.
Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to see you again!
I'm not paying this back.  I consider it "asshole tax."
My God, you're shot...
Who did this to you?
Hello?
Who's this?
Tyler?
... and you come home to this.
... You know me?
Is this a test, sir?
Yes... it's a test.
Who do you think I am?
What do you do, Tyler?
What do you want me to do?
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
Thank you.
What?
I guess so.
And, now it's gone.
But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.
Well, I have to file a claim...
Don't I?
Do what you like.
A hotel?
Would that be a problem?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Can I stay at your place?
Yes, you can.
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.
He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
Go ahead.  Say it.
This is crazy.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.
How do you feel?
Strange.
But a good strange.
Call what off?
The fight.
What fight?
Anyone?
My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?
Where's your car?
Hum.
What are you reading?
If you could fight any celebrity?
Alive or dead?
Doesn't matter.
Hemingway.  You?
Any historical figure.
Good answer.
You're okay with this?
She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay away from that one.
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
Okay.
Promise you won't.
Yes, I promise.
Promise?
I said I promise!
You want to finish her off?
"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
You get rid of her.
What is this place?
Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it.
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
We don't need him...
No thanks, I quit.
You quit?
Yeah.  Where you headed?
What... ?
Six months advance pay.  Six months!
There's fight club in Delaware City.
Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
What are we doing?
Homework assignment.
I asked you what you studied.
I feel sick.
Hey.
Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"
You know what I mean.
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
What are you talking about?
This conversation...
... is over.
You're too young.  Sorry.
Four in Milwaukee.
Why do people think I'm you?
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
Why did you do that?
Answer me, Tyler.
Why do people think anything?
Is this really news to you?
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
Oh, yeah.  I didn't really know my Dad...
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
What... what are you saying?
No!  This isn't true.  We... we were around other people, together, both of us...
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
What about them?  They're lunatics.
You took me to the house.
The house is rented in your name.
You have jobs.
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
What about Marla?
What about Marla?
She's... you... you're fucking her.
You... you can't be serious about this.
What a ridiculous thing to say.
I'm going to...
...stop me?
I'm not going...
...to let this happen!
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
If I'm wrong, we're both dead..
I'm pulling the green wire.
Fuck you.
Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
Tyler...
What?
Ask me nicely.
Defuse the bomb, please.
Defuse the bomb?
Can't you call it off... ?
What the fuck -- ?
Damn it!  God-damn it...
Not exactly according to plan.
Why... why... why... ?
Why are you doing this?!
Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
I swear on my life, I won't...
What are you doing?
Do something for me.
What?
Appreciate something.
What?
Look at me...
Who is this?
Very good, Sir.
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
Abort the plan.
You told me you'd say that, too.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name...
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
Really?
It's free to all.
Ain't that something?
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
You're welcome to join our club.
Did you hear what I just said?!
Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me!
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
S-S-Stuff.
Biology, mostly.
Why?
Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
Would you rather be dead?
Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
The second one just dies.  A 16 year old kid.
You have to tell us now.
What about that?
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
Speed up.
No!  It can't be.
Should we knock?
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
Calm down, Kimmy.  It's not drugs, just weed.
A Trans Am.  That shit went out with New Kids on the Block.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again.  Did you?
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
Please.  It's not going to wait.
I've got to stop and help those people.
Are you Jorge Cruz?
Maybe.  What's this about?
What was the fight about?
Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
You mean Alex Browning.
We have to tell her she's in danger!
This is cheery.
Whoa, nine months?
Guys, let's not panic.  Isabella's safe.
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
Want me to drive?
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
Relax, you need to chill the fuck out.
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
And you're gonna die after me, right?
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
Kimberly?  It's Dad.
What feeling?
I'm sorry.  I'm just so happy that you're safe.
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
What on Earth are they doing?
Mom?
This place?!
Thirty-nine.
No.
Most kids do, I guess.
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
Can't you open the door?!
Carter, get out!
You know what to do.
I'll remove him.
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
We're losing our favorite teacher.
Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
I'm sorry we broke in.
And don't pass on the right.
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
It broke!
What are you doing?
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
Get control of yourself!
SHUT UP, BILLY!
Wow!
Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
Gettin' old, huh?
Show me how it operates.
You read me, Brewer?
Read you.
Batteries not included.
That's it?  Some C-4, a map and a knife?
I've seen worse places.
This place is a trip.
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
No cigarettes.
What's this stuff on the rice?
What's she saying?
What's that?
These guys look like they'd sell their mothers.
How you doing, Brewer?
That guy's not going to make it.
You never been in one of those things.
You better take off.
Gawd, you look awful.
You're gonna love it.
I'm Rambo.  This is Brewer.  Her name is Co.
Where did you find this clown?
I thought he was with you.
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
I do?
You think you are... .
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
I know.  I go with you.
Yes you can.
John.  My name is John.
Stay on your heading, Captain.
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
That's an order.
I don't work with spooks.  Not after that op in Cambodia.
Where?
Not yet.
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.
All this is for us?
What?
How long have you been setting up?
About 22 hours on site.
How long before you're fully on line?
It's not necessary.
I know...
Who're you?
American.  Come to get you out.
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
Hello, John.
Colonel.
This your stuff?
Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever trained.
Those men are all dead.
Congressional Medal of Honor.
We left some people behind there, John... POWs.
But now it's free, right?
Well did you or didn't you?
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
I like your nails.  Where did you get them done?
...SO...anybody special in your life?
Well, there's nobody special!
What?
I never really...went through a... dating period.
Really?
Oh, no..I have to get home...
Yep! Right on it!
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
I was attacked.
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
No, I'm fine... really...
... So... where did you sleep last night?
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
Can I have my desk please.
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
The moron?
He's not a moron.
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
I... You're not going to understand this.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
What does that mean?
See, I told you!
Well talk back.  He won't bite you.
So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?
My agent.  I called my agent.
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
Yeah, I know the place.  It's one of those chic <u>yuppie</u> gathering holes.
Where you comin' from?!
Uh... basement I think...
You a friend of Parry's?
Can I help you?
I'm... just looking for Parry...
I wanna go...Just let me go...
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
Where?  Maybe we can.
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Remember. One chorus and out.
It's O.K...It's O.K...Lets me help you up.
NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
Yes... I... I agree...
.....Me neither.
Fine.  I'll say no.
How un-sixties of you.
Hello Lydia?
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
Free?
Oh, Lydia!
Please don't hurt me?
I need a drink.
Have I died?
My name is Parry.
Hi... Where are my shoes?
They're --  -- What?
Where -- ?
<u>What</u>!?
<u>What</u>?!
The Little People?
They said you're The One.
... Do you know who I am?
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
The Little...
They work for Him.
See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it...
Parry.
Parry... I'm Jack.
I'm not married.
Do you follow her every day?
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
What's her name?
Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!
That's O.K.
But I gave it to you!
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
Will you shut-up!!!
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
SAW WHO!!?
The Red Knight!
Are there any questions?
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
Holdin' my penis...
...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
You advise us!
Are you all right?
Parry Parry?
No just Parry.
What a gyp.
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
What do you do - for a living I mean?
Tell me more. I want to know everything.
Well, it's enough for me.
You don't have to say that.
Excuse me...
You're married.
No, I...
You have a disease.
Twinky?
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
Cerveza.
Serveza yourself!
Now, now.
You can sing the song.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
I can't help it, honey, the ball just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on me...
I did, didn' I, El?
I'm not.
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.
I'm going on over there...
I'm not some piece a crap.
I know you're not.
You're goin' a find me dead one time.
I'll be gone two or three weeks.
You like it?
"Every trail that you blaze/Makes me..."
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
Is what you?
You're depressed that I come along.
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
Sure...
Rayette.
What?
No.
Sure you don't want anything?
What's your name?
Where are you going?
Alaska.
Can I get you anything else?
No. How much do I owe you?
I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
You want me to hold the chicken.
Wasn't it, ladies?
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
Oh my goodness... Bobby...
Robert Eroica...
Now don't...
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
I just can't look at you.
You always do this to me.
Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
No.
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
Robert...
I have to talk seriously with you...
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
What?
Daddy's very ill.
Oh, well, what, what's he...
Well...  I better let you...
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
Tita, I've got to go...
How long have you been staying here?
Uhm hmm. Some range.
Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
Do you want some gingerbread?
What?
With applesauce?
Look at that.
Why are you being so mean?
I think he's got a terrific personality.
Where is she, anyway?
It's none of your business!
Where's Catherine?!
I'm talking to you, Tita!
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
You were going without saying goodbye?
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
But what about me?
Bye, now.
Yes, intentionally.
That's dangerous, you know.
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
The day after tomorrow.
If you're free.
You don't call that music, though.
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
I didn't have any.
You had no inner feeling?
What?
You think I'm a fake.
I think it's what you think.
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
I don't find your language that charming.
No, don't do that...
No inner feeling.
That's right.
That's what you said?
Robert?
I have to talk to you.
Oh. You have to tell me that.
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
Yes.
That'll make you happy.
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
Robert, do you mind?
I'm not aware of it. Like what?
That's three games to none, Carl.
Oh, for chrissakes...
Robert, I think you better just...
What kind of doggy is that?
I don't think that's true.
It is true.
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
Don't call me "honey," mack.
You better hold onto your tongue!
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
Well, she was.
Miss Dupea.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
If you want to call it that.
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
Aaron, how you doin'?
Fine.
Look at me.
Why you have an attitude for?
There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
Do you have a name?
Victor.
What?
Wussup?
Yo.
Hi.
So watcha doin'?
Nothin'.
What are you doin' here?
I, umm, came to see you.
You know somebody around here?
Whadja wanna see me about?
So you got a girl?
Of course.
A play-ya.
Just chill.
That's it?
So what you think of me?
I buy them flowers.
How you treat them?
I kissed those girls.
Come down!
Wussup?
Why don't you ask Eddie?
Why?
I got punished, man.
Wha'?
She fucks it all up!
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
Eddie from Compost?
Which one?
She lives near Eddie?
I think she lives down by Pitt.
Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
For real?
A bad attitude.
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
How old is he?
I think he's 18 or 17.
You gonna talk to him?
Yeah.
You looking for somebody?
Wha'?
You here to see somebody?
Yeah.
Who?
A girl named Amanda.
What she look like?
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
Yo, that's my girl.
Positive.
You sure?
Your friend must be misinformed.
So what do you want with her anyway?
Probably.  One of the many.
What?
No.
You wanna do somethin' with me?
Not really.
Hey!
Where you know Amanda from?
Jus' from around the way.
You live around here?
Yeah.
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
You mean her.
Maybe tonight?
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
That's what he said.
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
Sonofabitch.
Wonder who his supplier is.
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
I ought to get some sleep.
Hey, what are you doing?
Hey you're really nuts.
They didn't do anything.
What? What are you talking about?
You're lucky.
Fletch.
Full name.
Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
My God, you're serious.
Ask anybody.
Not a prayer.
Thanks for coming down to see us.
Greetings, everyone.
This one's going to be even more fun.
What the hell are you doing here?
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
So where do you know Alan from?
We play tennis at the club.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
One. B-a-b-a-r.
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
Your aunt?
Mrs. Smith.
Right.
Well, which one?
Margaret.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
Oh, he was dying for years.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
So what do you figure?
No idea.
No idea at all?
Okay. Some idea.
Like when?
Like tonight.
You don't know me.
My pleasure.
I'm serious, Sam.
What, the heat here?
Affirmative.
The two surfer boys?
You don't have a piece of the action?
What?
You find the source?
Nothing. They're still there.
Are you all right, Doctor?
Where am I?
You're in the Records Room.
I'm fine.
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
Here you are, Doctor.
That's it?
I guess not.
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
Until she remarries, Fletch.
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
My lawyer was a bum.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
You may be right.
That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
Read this, please.
Wait a second --
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attaché cases.
My parents were great fans of the former President.
Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
Right.
Isn't that nice. Since when?
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
Then he has.
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
John Ultramalensky, right?
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
Hi Gummy. Hows the eye?
I'm the Sufi.
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
Sure you did.
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
That's Brazil.
Yeah. Maybe.
Why not?
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
Alan Stanwyk.
Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent.
I'm all ears.
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
Do you have a passport?
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
That's right.
Will you kill me?
Can I steal you for a minute?
Deal.
Shoot.
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
Not our kind of people, you understand.
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'
I wonder if that's his doctor.
Did you say cops?
My hero.
Cute young thing, too.
I'm sorry?
His bride. Cute as a button.
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
No, thank you.
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
That's a strange combination.
Preoccupied with what?
Why do you keep doing this?
You are a rich woman.
Who is it?
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
I ordered lunch.
I mean put clothes on.
Lunch...
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
I saved his life during the war.
You were in the war?
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Can I ask you a question?
Depends on the question.
Thanks for the great time.
What is this?
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
What are you talking about?
What does all this mean?
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
But I've seen the deed.
No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
I'll take you to a game.
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
Act natural.
I think you better sit down.
What is this....
I checked. There was no divorce.
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
I'm calling the police. Right now.
You can't do that.
Don't tell me I can't --
Don't worry, I can take it.
You shouldn't be here.
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
Cabana one.
I would, actually.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
Muchas gracias.
The door was unlocked.
Lock's busted.
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
Where is she?
Moved out.
She moved out.
So you're saying she moved out.
I'm her cousin.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
I never read the paper.
What's the spread on the game tonight?
I don't know.  Look!
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
So let's go! We run the pictures.
How gray?
What about finding the source?
I have some ideas.
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.
What?  Who the hell are they?
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.
Fletch, you want an apology?
Not really.
Not really?
Jim Swarthout?
Frieda's boss.
Who's Frieda?
You don't know the Underhills?
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
Mrs. Stanwyk!
But I ain't got you...
But I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Who's your decorator?
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
No thanks.  I carry my own.
Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
Actually, you may take it all now.
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
Have what?
What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
That was close...
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
Thanks for the promotion, man.
Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
So what about this watch?
Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
You going to be okay?
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
Make eye contact when you say that.
I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
Contacts.
I don't know, what was the case?
Aha, just what I suspected!
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
Got those Vomit invites here...
Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
How much?
You gave it to the girls for one.
Hey, they blew me.
A simple 'please' would suffice...
It's red, Ford.
You okay?
Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
People still watch that?
Zuzu, wake up...
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Ford, you were right!
Nice left you got there, jerk.
This way...
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
Are you okay?
Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!
So, Zuzu.  Are you okay?
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
I tried to help you...!
And hey, I appreciate it...
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
So, did you find my dad?
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
What's fine?
I'm off it!
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
Let me go out like a man.
Well, hello, Ford.
Jazz, we're talking here.
It doesn't have to be like this?
It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
Kill them.  Not quickly.
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
Shit.
I'm still the king!
You're that guy, the private eye.
You're a poet and didn't know it.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
Only on a first name basis.
That's cute.  You're funny.
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
Hi, private eye guy!
Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
This isn't music!
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
'Bye, Johnny...
What's my name?
Doyle.
What?
Mr. Doyle.
I'm clean.
You don't use shit?
No - no.
How's everything?
There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
Boca?
B.O.C.A.
Doesn't register.
Who knows?
Where do you want it?
Where are you?
Takin' care o' business, honey.
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
Yeah?
What's your name, asshole?
I don't...
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Henri c'est gentil d'être venu.  Je vous présente mon associé, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.
Did you pick up the car?
It is waiting for you in the garage.
Did they follow you?
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
Allo... Salvatore...
Who's this --
Twelve o'clock... yes...
It has to be by the end of this week.
It's your problem.
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Pour moi?
Le sommes nous?
Are you sure it is dead?
Sale boulot.
Il fallait le faire.
What happens to the schedule?
We must follow it.
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
You're in show business.
I got no music!
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
Where from?
Where's he from?
You want some eggs.
Why not?
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
Yeah!
When ya go back on?
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.
How'd I know he had a knife.
Never trust a nigger.
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?
Drink this.
Who is that guy?
Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
Popeye.
Yeah.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
You got the warrant?
You want the red or the white?
Timezit?
Same car.
Hey, Bo.
Pass.
What is that old building?
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
What was it?
It was a crematorium.
For garbage?
Yeah.
You remember Mary Finelli?
What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.
No, I don't.
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
Where's the collar, in the cells?
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
Why haven't they killed the juice?
Switches are shorted out.
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
How do we get to the vault door?
Baltimore?
Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?
It looks open on the other side.
Don't know what's behind it.
Gotta be another way up, Frank.
You okay, man?
Hey, bud.
How about a little of the King?
Damn.
How was your tour?
Butch called.
Did he?
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
Frank...what's wrong?
Where's Johnny?
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
I love you, Bud.
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
I'm off.
Honey, what is it?  Just tell me.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
I'm serious.
Hey, bud.
Lucky throw, fire boy.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.
I think you know, Frank.
What do you mean?
415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
Next time lets put some money on it.
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
Daddy, I'm scared.
Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.
You ready?
Wait...
Uh, hello?
WB2YKXB, who've I got?
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
Queens, New York.
Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
Sorry 'bout that.
What'd you just say?
You call your son Little Chief?
What'd you say your name was?
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
What?
What's going on?
What?
You just burned the desk.
That's impossible.
Dad...?
How could this be happening?
Sun spot?
You sound...ground up...?
I'm thirty-five years old.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
I think I'm losing you.
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
What are you talking about?
I lost you.
I never knew you, Dad.
Why?
Fire.
That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
It did, Pop.  It did.
When?
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...
Dad...?
Chief?!  Is that you?
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
Are you alright"?
Something happened, something...
It's Mom.
What?  What is it?
She's not here.
Whatta you mean she's not here?
That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
What are we like in...1998?
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
You really wanna know?
Hang on a sec, John.
John, you still there?
I'm right here, Dad.
You all right?
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
In my pocket.
What...
Please, Dad, just do it.
Dad, what the hell is going on?
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
John.  John, you all right?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
You're not looking too good.
Maybe you outta lay off a little...
Another rough night, huh?  That it?
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
Which means he probably knew her.
Uh, huh.
Got a minute?
Sounds good.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
I'm sure everything'll work out.  She really loves you...
So how are things at the hospital?
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
You work too hard, John.
She's pretty special.
Are you a good cop, John?
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello."
You used to be on the job?
I look familiar?
The 2-3.  Homicide.
Nah, just working the job.
Where are you going?
Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
No more... I can't!
What're you gonna do?
Breakfast?
What was that?
Why don't we go take a swim?
How about a roll in the hay?
Think you can figure it out?
I vote for me.
I'm a slow eater.
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
Maybe we should do some exercise.
What's the matter?!
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
Will you come with me?
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
What are they saying?
Come on down!
What's this?
Your bed.
Derek... stop.
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
Is that so bad?
I don't know.
What?
Look what I found.  Remember these?
Did you stay here last night?
No.  I got here just before you did.
Somebody was in here.
Shelly!  Where are you?!
Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.
It's deceiving.
What happened that night?
You know him?
You're Shelly?
What d'ya got in there?
My whole world.
In that little thing?
What are we gonna do?
Why don't you help us?
That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
Is... is everything all right?
Please... be cool.
Are they following us?
Yes.
I don't see anything.
Got any good ideas?
Bullseye!
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
Why do you do these stupid things?!
I have to.
You don't "have to."
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
I never said you were "nothing".
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.
Will you slow down?  It's hard enough to read this thing.
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.
I'm getting real tired of this maniac.
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
Is that all you found?
Whaddya mean?
Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!
You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
Ahh, nothing.
My ass.
Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
Daddy, what is going on?
It's all over.
So what are ya drawin'?
There...Ya happy?
No.
Why?
Okay, give it back.
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
Lake Forest Green?
They did show up.  Isn't that great?
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
Did you hear me?!
You mean you had a bad dream.
Where'd you get this?
Are they grown-ups?
That's debatable.
Which is?
Boy scouting.
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
What's goin' on?
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
Doesn't that tell you something?!
Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
Well, let's hope not!
The what?
Steven...
I'm here.
I know who you are.
I need to talk to you.
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
No, I --
Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
Look, I don't want your money!
You need to leave.
I know everything about you, Diana.
Everything going okay?
It's going.
Legs giving you trouble?
Steven buggin' you?
I gotta get back to work.
What's the problem here?
Hello...
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
Maybe you should be moving on.
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
Why did you want her body?
For a good reason.
Tell me.
Sorry.
She's beautiful.
I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
Randy, c'mon!
Okay.
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
Oh, my dear God...
How many times do you want to hear this?
Until I hear the truth.
I know what it sounds like.
You don't know shit!
Then why were you at her house?!  She didn't want anything to do with you.
About what?
No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
A major prick.
What are you going to do?
A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
That was truly excellent.
Time to check out the waiters.
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
Well...how do you feel?
What's wrong?
Did you hear that?
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
And you'll never do it again.
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
Where's the radio?
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
What's that?
This is Jason's fault!
Jason's here in New York.
Where did you get that alcohol?
That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
I doubt very much that one even exists.
What did you do with Rennie??
There must be a phone around here somewhere.
Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.
I don't think that's such a safe idea
What a beautiful day.
You're telling a lie.
I...I can't...
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
You had me worried to death!
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
Get in the boat, Rennie!
I...I can't...
I'm glad you decided to come after all.
So, are you having fun yet?
I can't swim.
What is your location?
Rennie...
Hi, Sean.
I heard you weren't coming.
I got you a present.
But I didn't get you one...
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
I didn't mean for you to go!
Rennie...??
But Rennie...
Rennie...what'd they do to you??
You have to call the police...
Very big.
I opened thousands of brains.
What did you find?
You are going where?
Crosstown.
We must abandon.
What do you mean, we must abandon?
We must abandon.
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
Under the Manhattan Bridge.
This is a great young out-of-work actress.
Shut up, Elliot.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
Press a button and they give us money.
How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
She wants a divorce.
Don't talk like that.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
Asbestos lining.
I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
Tonight. What's tonight?
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
What was it like?
Is it safe?
Do we care?
I think we Nought to wait.
I say we go.
You say we go?
Do not inhale.
Where are you going?
Don't wait Efor me.
He carries a gun.
It's your best play, Nicky.
Keep going west. Last building before the river.
Paisley Porter.
Had to be him.
Great game.
Unbelievable.
I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
What are we talking about?
Of course I saw it.
Did you see the winning run score?
This could be it.
This could be it.
Let's work on it.
This could Pbe it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
Does it feel comfortable?
Does what feel comfortable?
This could be it.
You know about Adele.
She's dying.
I talked to her two days ago.
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
What?
This is how we've managed to last.
We're able to surprise each other.
In and out of bed.
Because we're completely mismatched.
It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
It's your best play, Nicky.
They'll lose because they're my team.
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
I go to college. I thought you knew.
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
That's completely crazy.
Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
What will we talk about?
Will I believe you when you tell me something?
Why won't you tell me your name?
First you tell me.
What else?
What else?
Yes.
What do we want?
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
It's your best play, Nicky.
Your father said you might be here.
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
All right. What's been going on?
That's always been my problem.
Be open with me. I'd like that.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
Joanne Bourne.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
I am really, deeply sorry.
It violates so many trusts.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?
Great game. Red Sox are winning.
Life is good.
All the failures, all the fatalism.
Washed away.
What did it say?
A thousand things.
This could be it!
Life is true.
Who is it?
I'm at the door.
Go way. I'll call a cop.
Pop, will you let me in?
Where the hell are you?
It's me. Nicky.
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
But the son is suppose to stop crying.
You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
Since when did that matter?
Let's not start that again.
My back is killing me.
Where's your elastic brace?
So what are you going to do about it?
What do you want me to do?
Everybody else does. Why not you?
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
Matthew's my grandson.
Now that's a complicated subject.
You see what you're doing, don't you?
What am I doing?
You're charming the boy.
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
Then say it.
Life is good.
I don't know.
Washed away.
Because life is good.
Don't worry. It's a test.
This could be it!
Then they lost?
Why do you care?
Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
I hate the Mets.
Have to hurry back.
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
Game six is history,pal.
Sidney.
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
I was educated by nuns.
There was a review.
So does Elliot.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
And he has finer moments now and then.
Endearing.
A little drastic maybe?
What?
You know what.
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
I hear good things about the new play.
So do I. Over and over.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
Would you like to meet him?
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
Is it true?
Is what true?
I don't know.
He's a very sweet man.
Where are you going now?
Home.
Someone waiting for you?
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
Yes.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.
Are you sure?
Everyone takes his turn.
I am your wife.
Please! You're being foolish!
God gave you ten thumbs.
"Take a fifth step, that we may serve the people."
"Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life."
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
What do you expect when you talk like that?
Enough.
What are you doing?
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.
They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.
You mean Gandhi?
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
What'd he say?
I'll take your luggage back, baas.
What can we do?
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
You will respect the law.
You're an ambitious man.
Do you remember much of South Africa?
After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.
We need your help!
Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else.
The fools!  Sorry...
It's split the Government.
Will you have a glass of sherry?
Perhaps some tea?
I dined at the prison.
All right. Fine.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
Have you read his magazine?
Could we cut all news off? I know --
Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible?
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out. We have to go back!
How much extra?
Not yet, I'm afraid.
No?  What's keeping you?
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.
Don't underestimate these imposters.
That's the last.
Something's not right.
He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
We don't have the manpower.
What are you waiting for?
Where do we start?
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
We believe we have a suspect.
Twelve have a mission within the week.
Hello.
Jerome--?
Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"?
It's about the Director.
That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
What's wrong with him?
Six one.
You okay, Jerome?
It needs work.
You had to be a right-hander.
You really need that much?
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?
Who died?
The Mission Director.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
Let's get out of here.
I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!
11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew.
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
It's all right.
Any particular reason?
We can't stay here.
What are you talking about?
What makes them think that?
They found my eyelash.
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
You really had other offers?
I've got enough on my mind without that.
If you say so.  The stripe.
How was your evening?
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
Where are we going?
Where are you taking her?
Everybody goes there.
You may as well invite her here.
How are you, Jerome?
Not bad, Jerome.
How the hell did you get here.
Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
Why have you done this?
In case you get back before I do.
Where are you going?
First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?
What will happen to the others?
Vincent...Vincent...
German, is that you?
You can wear lifts.
Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
You worried about the cost?
Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?
Were <i>you</i> alone?
Why don't we say we were together?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.
Have they found our friend?
It was a mercy-killing after all.
They found an eyelash.
Where?
In the South Wing.
Does it have a name?
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
I envy you, Jerome.
So you didn't do it after all.
Why are we leaving?
What about the car?
Let's walk.
I can't.
My medication.  I left it back there.
--when you go away.
A year is a long time.
What's this, Lamar?
Flight got you nervous?
What are you doing?
The doctor will give you something.
I'm not doing it.
The name?  For the certificate.
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
I'll take care of my end.
Hello, McCoy.
Beynon.
Three... Rudy got ambitious.
And you got him...
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
Hello, Doc.
Hi.
You want to drive?
Where do you want to go?
It doesn't look like that.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
What's Beynon got set up?
Where did you get those?
I've been doing my homework.
Just like old times?
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Where did you get them developed?
Assumed name... Houston.
Half a million.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
What do you want for dinner?
How does it taste?
How's Estelle?
Fatter... some things never change.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
That's not all of it.
After four years and now the question comes up.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
I guess I'm kind of...
It's all right.
Really?
How was it?
$250,000 right off the top.
Is he straight?
I couldn't have... much longer.
That doesn't hurt.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
I didn't. I just waited.
... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...
You know how I feel?
Promise you won't laugh.
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
Bullshit.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
What about the bank?
Doc...
Why?
He might be ready to chop us up.
I don't want to go there.
Why didn't you tell me?
Yeah.
Who's she?
She's on TV.
What do we do?
A man helped me open it...
And switched keys.
He must have.
Fifteen minutes.
Texas is a big state.
I can handle it.
Do you mean that?
There may be a hunting party.
Why, there's nothing on the news?
You're full of ifs.
That would be the first time.
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
Only one car.
Where are you going?
How much?
Are you hungry?
No scars?
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
We're going to make it.
I want to say something.
I don't want to hear it.
Sounds good.
You want to try with me?
Things can't get much worse can they?
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
I'll be ready.
Yeah.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
Come on, come on.
Who was it?
You okay?
Where do we go from here?
How long before this car's hot?
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
What now?
That certainly makes you kind of special...
No, I'm afraid not.
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
I really hope you have a nice trip.
Hope you get to where you're going.
All right. Shells?
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
Gonna knock down a wall?
Where?
Chicago.
You were with him?
Yeah. I got out.
Just in case someone gets a shot off.
Suit yourself.
Okay. How many bank exits?
Two.
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
Aren't we going a little hard?
Just sandwiches...
He took the day off.
Then you do it.
Drive.
How was that?
Just fine.
Which way?
What's it to you?
Come on. How much?
And I keep my mouth shut?
You got it.
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for God's sake keep your mouth shut.
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
That right?
You can trust him...
How long have you been married?
Can he trust you?
I've got to stop.
Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
Yes.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
When did you find out?
A couple of weeks back.
What did you do?  Albert?
Nothing. What could I do?
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
Yes. I told him.
What did he say?
You knew what I'd do.
What do you want?
What happened to this car?
What's it got to do with you?
This is my brother's car.
Oh ay?
Well, he drove it into the river.
What about the brakes?
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
How'd it happen, then?
I know.
I made a mistake.
What?
I made a mistake.
What about?
That's not good enough.
Jack, you're wrong.
Jack?
That's nice.
Who paid you to see me off?
I can't Jack. How can I?
No, don't Jack, don't.
Who sent you, Thorpey?
Where's he living these days?
What about?
Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?
I must go. I'm in a hurry.
I can't.
How were things between you and Frank?
He was all right to me.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Yes.
Though nicer than most?
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
Why'd you see him so regular?
Once a week?
I call that regular.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
You know Sid Fletcher?
What?
You know Sid Fletcher?
I work for him.
I know him too.
Who?
Sid Fletcher.
Oh, do you?
Yes.
Yes. I met him last year.
We went about together.
Really?
Yes, while he was here.
While he was here. You went about together?
He was here for four days.
Was he?
Could you do me a favour?
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
So where are we going, Princess?
To the demon king's castle, of course.
And what was that?
Brumby.
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?
Entertaining.
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
You sure about that?
I want to give you an Oscar.
You've been watching the film.
Tell me about the girl.
What girl?
The young girl. Who pulled her?
I don't know.
Was it Albert?
Shouldn't think so.
Yeah.
Who set it up?  Eric?
Expect so.
Now tell me the truth.
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.
Nice of you to come.
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
Look, look.  Get your suit cleaned.
No. It's all right.
Sorry about your father.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
How's school?
I left last year.
Oh, what you doing now?
Working at Woolworths.
That must be interesting.
You all right now?
Yeah.
You coming to South America?
Where you going to live, then?
At me friend's house.
Where's that?
Did you work with him, Keith?
I mean, what for?
It just would. He was always the same.
Since when did he drink whisky?
You work here, Keith?
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
Where would I find him?
What you having, Jack?
Heard of a man called Thorpe?
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
Nowt.
See you later.
Where you off to?
How many?
Who's Brumby?
What happened to you, then?
Did they give you a rough time?
No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?
I see.
I'm staying with a friend.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
It's not like that, luv.
Are you a traveller?
Definitely.
Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
What is it?
My brother, Frank.
Is he staying the night?
Funny.  Can I phone London?
I'm sorry.
You don't look it.
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
I'll call the police.
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
Now just a minute...
You sod.
They came back?
What'll they do to him?
They bloody hurt me.
You're lucky. They kill as well.
Thorpey nearly died laughing.
That little shit!
What about Keith?
What about Keith?
What you going to do?
Pension him off.
You wouldn't.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
What's that supposed to mean?
Are you awake?
No.
Did you sleep well?
No. Are you tired?
Do us a favour?
What, and get myself beaten up again?
No chance of that.
Not much.
They're friends of mine.
And that'll make me feel better?
You coming back?
Is he?
Jack Carter.
Eric. Eric Paice.
What you doing around here then?
Didn't you know this is my home town?
No, I didn't know that.
Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays?
No. I'm visiting relatives.
A bereavement. A death in the family.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, well. Small world, isn't it?
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Oh, you've been watching television.
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
That's not always a healthy way to be...
They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow.
Eh? Have a drink.
Scotch, please.
Yeah.
Nasty way to go.
Not going, Jack?
I have to. Things to see to.
We've got to take you back to London.
Gerald wants to see him first.
Bollock naked with his socks still on?
Not suede boots!
Knock it off, Gerald.
What's that? A hundred?
That's right, Harry.
Three hundred altogether?
All right. Two hundred.
Four hundred?
That's right.
Polacks and deadbeats.
...Polacks...
Deadbeats all.
...they hold on to their money...
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
I had to.
You had to, yeah.  Why?
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
Mmm...
You ever get 'em?
You did?
They came in and they, you know...
They did.
They killed the goose.
They did.
And now...
We're stuck with this...
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
...this shit...
It's too...
Eh?
I, I...I...
Some contest board...
I...
It's not.
That's right?
Eh...?
...that's right...
Eh?
...that's right...
He is?
The nurses?
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
What?
Starting up.
What?
No.
You...
You...
You build it!
That's what I...
You fucking build it!  Men come...
...you're absolutely right.
They...
They have...
Someone should stand up and strike back.
Somebody...
Someone should hurt them.
Yes.
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
How do you know he'd buy them?
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
No, we're just...
We're just "talking" about it.
As an idea.
No.
Talking about it as a...
No.
As a "robbery"?!  No.
Well.  Well...
You didn't?
No.  Not actually.
Did you?
You're actually talking about this?
You're going to steal the leads?
Did you talk to Graff?
Is that what I said?
What did he say?
Yes.
What will he pay?
A buck a shot.
A job with Graff.
Is that what I said?
He'd give me a job.
What?
What?  What?  The leads.
You...
I'm sorry?
Yes.
Dave.
Oh, yes, George.
What if you don't get caught?
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
Why would they come to me?
They're going to come to everyone.
No.
Are you sure?
...you don't have to come in...
...and rob the place...
Me?
Absolutely.
I didn't ask to be.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
You went for it.
In the abstract...
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
Do you need five grand?
Is that what I just said?
I do?
And why is that?
Can we get some coffee...?
Fine.
I, you know, they should be insured.
Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
Yes.
Huh?
Yes.  They are old.
They're ancient.
Clear...
It is dead.
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
That's...
They stole...
He said we...
To the cops?
Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste of time.
A waste of time?  Why?
The cops?
Yes.  The cops.  No.
They aren't?
No.
Where were you?
Where was I?
Was I?
Yes.
No.
You have nothing to hide.
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
Yeah.  You know who doesn't?
No, who?
Thieves.
Why?
They're inured to it.
You think so?
Will you excuse...
Where did Moss...?  I...
Did they...?
You understand?
Oh, God, I hate this job.
Read it.  Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.  What happened here?
Shelly, the Machine, Levene.
You...
That's great.
Wh...wh...Wha...?
...how can you talk to me that... that...
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
Who used to say that?
That they're going to be upset.
Go to lunch, will you...
I want to work today, that's why I came...
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
Just go to lunch.
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
Williamson...Williamson, they stole the contracts...?
Excuse me, fella.
...did they...
The people downtown said...
Mr. Levene...?
You're done, come down, and let's...
What about the other two?
...no...
...then...
Roma.
Under him?
Murray...
You're saying that I'm fucked.
...and I'm going to get bounced and you're...
Murray said...
Either way.  You're out.
I'm out.
Why?
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
Then put me on the board.
Of what?
And what if you don't close.
Alright.
Alright.
Now?  Now?
Why?
What happened?
The leads are coming.
You are?
Yes, I am.
How do you know I made it up?
Well, hadn't it?
You're so full of shit.
You robbed the office.
Five thousand.  I kept half.
Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
It was his idea.
Only the beginning...
I've got the check...
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
I'm sorry.
Why?
John: John:...my daughter...
You did that?
My ass.  I told 'em.  Listen to this: I said...
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
"You do get the..."  Huh?  Huh?
Eight units?
That's right.
Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch...
They took the phones...
When?
They took the leads?
Just now.
Fuck you care...?
How was it...?
From the store.
What is it?
I wanted to speak with you about...
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
Uh...
Home...
Home cooking...
The monthly interview...?
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
What?
Kenilworth...?
I'm sorry...?
Me.
Yeah.
Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
Did I...?
Yes.
What do I...?
Three days.
No, I don't know.  Tell me.
To change our minds.
Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I can't, you saw my book...
But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
You don't count Saturday.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
What would have elapsed?
If we wait till Mon...
Yest...
What was yesterday?
And when was that check cashed?
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.
It's not me, it's my wife.
What is?
I told you.
What's going on here?
You tell me again.
She wants her money back.
No.  She told me "right now."
We'll speak to her, Jim...
She told me I have to.
What does that mean?
I...
What...?
I...
What power?
The power to negotiate.
This.
Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
What?
What are the police doing?
It's nothing.
You cashed the check?
Guess what the Machine did?
Fuck the Machine.
You hear what I said?
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
Eight units.  Mountain View.
Fuck you.
Guess who?
You just this morning...
Why not?
Is that what I did?  Dave?  I humiliated you?  My God...I'm sorry...
What is this, your farewell speech?
I'm going home.
Your farewell to the troops?
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
They didn't get my contracts.
They didn't get the contracts.
Did they...
They took some of the con...
You closed him yesterday.
It went down.  I filed it.
You did?
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
Aren't you going out today?
With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
If you don't want it, give it back.
I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift.
Three?  I count two.
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
We had a slight burglary last night.
Yes.
Did you like your party?
I got lots of presents.
Did you see my present for you?
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
I know.  How long will you be gone?
Just a few days.
Why do you have to go?
To do business.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
What position did you occupy?
Your friend lives in a fine building.
What took so long?
Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.
Yes, thank you.
I got surprises for everybody!
We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
You're not my father!
Then why do you come to me?
Is Kay coming?
I want to talk to you, Michael.
What's 'cent' Anne?'
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
Deanna, will you get back into the house!
I don't want to stay here...
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
You would risk your life for strangers?
I'm not afraid of his words.
He is weak.
He will grow strong.
Ready, Frankie.
Hey Mike, what can I say?
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.
It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
I want you to help me, Fredo.
No.
It was hard to have him killed.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
It was hard to have him killed.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
What is it?  Can I help?
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
He's an Italian?
Beautiful.
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
The 'patrone' is here.
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
That's off now.
How long does this go on?
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
Am I a prisoner?
If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.
He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
Hello?
Will you tell him?
Me too, Tom?
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
If you need anything, just...
But if you're wrong...
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
I took care of it.
They can come in now.
Wait... there's something else.
Go on, tell me.
Was it a boy or a girl?
It was a boy.
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.
That plane goes to Miami...
Fifteen percent skim?
It might show.
What's up?
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
I think I prefer to see my client privately.
The room has a bug in it.
Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.
Did my brother go back?
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
You're right.
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
Do you owe markers?
There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much.
And what's the price of their not finding out.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
Is he related to the witness?
Senator Kane.
This meeting is adjourned.
This committee owes an apology!
Whose orders are these?
How's the baby?
Sleeping inside me.
Does it feel like a boy?
Why don't you sit down?
Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
Kay, I told you...
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
Are you Klingman?
Who's asking?
Where can we talk?
Who do you think you're talking to?
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.
No, I meant lose his family.
Nothing is more important.
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
So?
You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.
I just left our friend in Miami.
How is his health?
When do we talk?
Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.
You were unfair with them.
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?
I want you to settle on their terms.
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator.  But never think it applies to my family.
We'll try.
On the phone?
Rosato, where's your brother?
He don't want to talk?
We worked it all out beforehand.
Are we going to eat or what?
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
The same assurance we got from you.
You want a war?
We got friends in the commission.
I'm talking about Italians!
What about Michael Corleone?
He supports me.
How much more a month?
What was that?
I accept your generosity...
What makes you say that?
Fuck you.
So what did you think?
What's to be jealous of?
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
I wasn't going to try anything.
Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
It still hurt.  A lot.
You liked it too.
Sure.  I loved it.
Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
Your wife?
I'm not married.
Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
You ever been married, Hanna?
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
He is dead now, twenty years.
A homo?
You did not know?
Well...no, not really --
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
Thanks.  Why do you do it?
What have you done with him?
I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.
You must leave.  You were not here this morning.
Good morning.
Nice place.
Just that I was in the Marines.
Or would you prefer a beer?
No.  Iced tea's fine.
What?  Oh yes.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
"Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and "Son of" and all the rest?
I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
What did she mean by going flooey?
What was wrong?
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
Broke is more like it.
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
Football in college.
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.
You don't say?  Which picture?
I'm not wearing an undershirt.
Take a picture, it lasts longer.
We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.
Do you mind?
Is this David's doing?
Did you now?
I liked it.  We all did.
Did anyone laugh?
Did you kill anyone?
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
I'm not, you know.
I never thought you were.
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.
I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel.
Not at the moment.
Ah.  A philosopher.
Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?
You first.
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
Everybody has stories to tell.
What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
You're talking through your hat now.
You were a soldier?
You asked me to model.  Remember?
Good afternoon, Clayton.
I suppose you'd like the top down.
If that's okay?
What did I tell you?  Listen.
No.  The girl.
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
Neither of us really belongs here.
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
Run for what?
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already?
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
That only leaves the rest.
Do I have any other choice?
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
I never made it to Korea.
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
Do you mind?
"A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."
I don't remember that one.
I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
Barnett.  Barnett on the wire.
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?
What won't do?
You are much too human.
What did you expect?  Bronze?
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
All right.  Let's take it off now.
What was that?
Oh Clayton.
Did I hurt you?
Nothing I didn't deserve.
Need some help?
I can undress myself, thank you.
You'll feel better tomorrow.
Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.
I liked it.  You learn stuff listening to old-timers.
You coming, Boone?
Hey, Boone.
You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
Thank you.
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
Should you be drinking in your condition?
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
I didn't ask George to invite you.
Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride feast upon her visage.
Jimmy.  How are you?
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Mr. Kay, sir.
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
He is not going to kill the old man?
She is horrible.
You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
Does the yardman come today?
Who was that at the door?
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
One likes to live simply.
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
You're serious.
Quite.
Then the rumors are true?
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
Can we talk about the horror movies now?
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Can that count as one question?
Of course.
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
My monsters?
How are you?
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
A boost. A big boost ...
Who was the job for?
Jesus ...
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
Jesus, man ... What'd you do?
It's about my brother ... Kip...
Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
I'm not interested --
I knew you'd say that.
This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
Get out of here, Ray --
One more night --
Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...
You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...
Well, that certainly won't do.
I know you --
You know my back -
You want to come along quiet?
How's that?
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
You have my word...
I know you.
A little family emergency --
I know you.
You know my back.
What are you still doing here, Randall?
I'm on the move -
Your girl works in there ...
I know you.
I'll catch you later, Randall --
Who is it -- ?
What's this -- ?
What's wrong with it -- ?
Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ...
Double-meaning intended, right?
When'd you get to town, Raines?
The other day....
You seem a little hinked-up ...
How'd it go?
Keys were in it ...
Got it ...
What's the matter?
It's all microchips and shit ...
Donny --
Lookit Kip. All grown up...
For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...
Peugot convertible ...
What color?
No. That was Higgins ....
Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...
Most of 'em are late-model...
Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
How's it going -- ?
Dignity...
Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in McO...
Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit..
That's a good one, Donny...
How are we supposed to--
No ... And they won't take my calls ...
What does that mean -- ?
How you know that?
Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?
You look good...
You, too, Ma...
What are you doing back?
Have you seen him?
No.
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
What time of year?
You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
Oh, for God's sake
Breakfast brunch -- ?
Any more, O -- ?
You guys are through...
Hey, Kip, what's up?
What do you say, Toby?,
You goin' home?
Yeah... You want a ride...
How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
It looks just like a regular Mustang --
Any more ...
Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...
Hey, Kip ...
Kip -- ?
Yeah ...
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
I heard you were pumping gas -
Something like that -
Nah. It's a scratch.
Hey, you want something to eat ?
So what are you gonna do?
About what?
What happened to you?
He's gonna kill you -- !
I can handle it --
You can handle it?
I can handle it --
You can handle it?
I can handle it --
You?
Me.
You?
You don't think so, huh?
What are you doing here?
"Shadow games?"
Thank-you ...
Ain't we good-timing here ... ?
The family that steals together, deals together...
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
What era was that -- ?
The era when crime didn't pay --
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
You okay -- ?
Too early to tell. Nervous?
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
Come here --
What?
Come here -
What?
I know ...
You boost her -- ?
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
Where you off to -- ?
Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
What for -- ?
Now what -- ?
Shit ...
What are we gonna do -- ?
Hospital.
You know of one -- ?
Where we going -- ?
Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.
Call 911 -
Call 'em here -- ?
See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
Buy you a drink?
"Mitch?"
On account of Mitch?
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
I left town. I didn't leave you.
A distinction worth noting ...
And you got some Italians -- ?
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
I go with you --
That what you want?
That's what I want ...
You mentioned that in your letters
No way ...
No ... ?
Ready -- ?
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
I take out my slim-jim...
Slip it in ...
You're going high-cheese, dude --
Unlock your button ...
"Unlock my button" ... ?
The alarms go off ...
I pop your hood; find your siren wires
I do ... I cut "em...
Cut 'em...
Now... I'm in ...
Of course you are. You're a professional...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
Wrong preposition...
Hear you roar ...
What about The Club ... ?
Let me worry about The Club ...
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...
This time it's for real?
What's that?
Hello, Otto ...
You remember Junie?
You think it can be done?
Are you considering a comeback tour?
And the moral of that story is -- ?
You need him...
Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
What happened to Sway?
Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ...
Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
How old are you now, Toby?
Who's "Eleanor?"
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
So she flies -
You know what you got here?
Uh ... Randall -- ?
Why don't you leave him alone?
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
What are you doing here, assface?
Which way's out, man -- ?
Look at Jeannie's kid.
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
Billy, how are you?
What did you hear about that thing?
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
No. No. The guy from downtown.
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
Nods again.
I warned you a million times.
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.
I'm in construction.
Go inside. I'll be right there.
What are you gonna do?
My bag. My bag.
I don't care. Something's going on.
Henry.  Wake up.
You son of a bitch. She's been here.
We've got to help each other.
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
Who's gonna do that?
Where's the stuff?
What are you talking about?
You know. The stuff I left.
I flushed it down the toilet.
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
What happened? You okay?
I got seared.
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
What about the schools?
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
Paulie was just talking about him.
It's been six months.
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
Give'm a drink.
I gotta talk to you.
Don't worry about it.
There are cops all over the place.
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
You want the melon?
Nah.
Done.
I want to talk to Jimmy.
What happened to you?
Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
Where'd you find such creeps?
You ready?
You know what to do?
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
Come on, relax. He's drunk.  He's been locked up for six years.
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
No, no. It's okay.
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
I hate to do dishes.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
Are you okay? What happened?
I don't need this... You said tonight and now it's not tonight...
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
He's okay. They sobered him up.
He didn't call?
He's with his friends.
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
I got dry cleaning.
I don't want them left back.
You want a partner?
Who's she talking to?
Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit!
Suck my cock!
Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what happens.
All right, then.
I've been shit faced for like two weeks.
She's sharp as a marble.
She didn't do it again did she?
What do we got?
When's the arraignment?
What'd you get? You get leniency?
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
Who'd you call?
Why not?
I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride.
How's the woman?
Gone.
Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
Week after I'm twenty-one.
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
You and Morgan throw?
No, I had to talk him down.
What class?
Hi.
How you doin'?
How'd you know where to find me?
Oh, right.
Yah, that is a nice ass.
Fuck this, let's get something to eat...
Yah, all right...
How much money you got?
Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
Come on, Will...
Morgan, Let's go.
You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
Chuck, let's go.
Why don't you beat off at your house?
What'd you say about me?
Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day.
I don't think I...Larry?
I have about seventy-three...
How'd you like that course?
Seven.
And what do you see?
Somethin's in my room.
You're in a safe place, Will.
Where is it touching you?
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...
Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What're you doing?
Hey fuck you.
Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.
Really?
Yes. Under two conditions.
Of course.
Okay. How?
I think so.
What's that?
Half-red, half-black--
--that?--
--Half-red, half-black--
--That edge!
I told you to cooperate with these people.
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
That's fine, but did you ever think--
It's right.  Take it home with you.
What are you smiling at?
I can come back.
Will.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
Find out what?
Good to meet you.
Uh-oh.
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
So who won the bet?
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
I didn't see you at the reunion.
Since Nancy died.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.
I need someone with your kind of background.
My kind of background?
Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick?
Just meet with the boy once a week.
Can we do it at my office?
I got it.
Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit.
Would you excuse us?
Tom.
To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?
I live right around the corner.
You moved?
Seems like it's going well.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
He married his cousin.
I do.
Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
Now wait a minute--
--And confuse him--
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
Hello, Sean.
Come in.
Sean...
Where're you going?
Why there?
I got one of those too.
How about one now?
Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
What's the point?
What do you want to do?
There is somebody...
Who is he?
It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
I could go for a Whopper.
What happened?  You got fired, huh?
So, you finally got a job Morgan?
You're right. I know.
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
Yeah, I read those.
That must have taken you a long time.
You think so?
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
Yes, I do.
285.
Yeah. Do you paint?
No.
This is a real piece of shit.
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
--Well, maybe that means you.
Maybe you should be a patient and sit down.
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
Why thank you.
Yeah? You got a lady now?
How'd it go?
Well, are you going out again?
I don't know.
Why not?
Haven't called her.
You ever think about gettin' remarried?
My wife's dead.
Hence, the word remarried.
No, I don't.
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
"I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
They could see that I meant it.
Would have been nice to catch that game though.
I don't know.
I guess.
What did you think?
Do you think you're alone?
Do you have a soul-mate?
They're all dead.
Not to me, they're not.
Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
Don't give me you line of shit.
You want to read it?
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
Yes.
The wrench, why?
Oh, I know.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
Don't fuck with me.
It's not your fault.
I know.
That's what you want?
Yeah, I think so.
Good for you. Congratulations.
Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
I just want you to know, Sean...
You're Welcome, Will.
No. Thank you.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
Sounds good, where are you now?
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
So you just want to use me and go?
No I wasn't...
No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
You grew up around here?
Not far from here, South Boston.
How was that?
I bet you have a great family.
You know, nothing special.
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
I have twelve big brothers.
Not a chance.
Bullshit.
I swear to God.
Do you know all their names?
I want to meet them.
Where have you been?
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
Promise?
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.
I'm supposed to understand this.
Why do we always stay here?
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
They don't come over here that much.
I think I can make it to South Boston.
How's it goin'?
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
Some, a little.
Just for fun?
Do you play the piano?
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
Will? Are you awake?
No.
Come with me to California.
I want you to come with me.
How do you know that?
I know. I just do.
Yeah, but how do you know?
I don't know. I just feel it.
And you're sure about that?
I can't go out to California.
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
Then what are you afraid of?
What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
I'm not honest?
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
No, you don't want to hear that.
Take care.
You doin' the hirin'?
Will ya look at her!
Ready, Pa?
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
Ready, Ma?
Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'?
Don't hold me so tight.
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
You bust outa jail, Tom?
Naw. They paroled me.
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
People done it. If they could, we could.
Lots must a died, too.
Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl.
She's hotter'n a heifer.
Any gas?
Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll make it?
I didn't see nothin'.
Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.
What's it to you?
That's not your affair. Name.

How many men?
Four.
Women?
Two.
Two.
Can all of you work?
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?

Open up! We hear you got a riot.

That's the way it is.
An' you say no cops?
Say, who runs this place?
Why ain't they more like it?
*You* find out, I can't.

Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy?
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
Been out travelin' around?
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.

How long you plan to be in Arizona?

Got any plants?
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.

Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
You take this.  I ain't hungry.
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
I like the tent better.
Anybody ask anything?
No'm.
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
Connie's gone.  Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this.
Make her easy, John. Watch her.

But what about this?
Maybe it's nice on the other side. Them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty.
Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live.
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!

You people looking for work?
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
Can you pick peaches?
You sure you got ever'thing ready?
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
You do not.
Yes I do.
You don't...
In the corporate offices.
Oh... really?
What do you do?
You do not.
It's what I do.
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
Marty, you haven't changed a bit!
So, what are you doing now?
Bob. Bob Destephano.
What?
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
Bob...
It's me. Martin Blank.
Really...? So what?
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
Never better.
What am I gonna do?
Jesus...
I just play my own collection.
That's it?
Not much else.
What's your business?
I'm a professional killer.
Where have I been?
Are you going to the reunion?
It's always the little things.
Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.
Bad experiences.
You met people.
Watched television?
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
Yes.
Unbelievable.
Are you there?
Flowers. That's funny.
As long as I get the laugh.
You look beautiful.
...Let me get my coat.
Do you want to get a drink first?
Shoulda brought my gun.
No time.
Like heroin?
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
Yes.
Not the other way around...?
Is it something you've done?
...About five years now.
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
I was leaving.
Will you come with me?
I'm staying here.
What if I come back?
Shouldn't you be taking notes?
How do you know?
I just know.
Yes.
Okay. Repeat this after me.
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
Like a union?
Like a club. Work less, make more.
No harm no foul.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.
There you go. I left it blank.
Hey, Ken. How have you been?
Hello Martin. How have you been?
Hello, Bob.
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
Have you seen Debi Newberry?
Lisbon?
That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.
It was the PLO.
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
He's falling for her. Look at him.
He using her.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
One cannot love and kill.
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
Throw that away.
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
That's going to cost.
He didn't.
They blame you for the compromise.
They were very upset.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
Enough?
This is not good.
What's it look like?
It's fine.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
I bought a new rug.
That's wonderful, Mom.
What's a revival tent?
It's a place where religious people--
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
I spoke to your father the other day.
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
You have a headache?
I have a headache. You have a headache?
No, I don't have one.
We had a good laugh, didn't we?
I think I'll go see Debi today.
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
Marty! It's me. Paul.
Paul?
God it's great to see you.
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
He sells BMW's?
He gave me a great deal.
What the hell happened to you?
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
It didn't work out.
To shoot you. Correct.
Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
I'm a professional killer.
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
You okay?
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
Does Chicago count?
When I was first married.
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
A jogger, huh?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
You sleeping all right in that house?
I thought you lived in Chicago?
Enjoy the day.
Shit.
Need a lift?
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
Thanks.
How long did you live here with your wife?
Just make yourself comfortable.
You missed a button.
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to --
Show me again.
Annie!
I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
Mom?
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
Whatever you want.
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
Would you like to see that?
I don't care.
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
That's not true!
You buckled up?  You cold?
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
He's still sitting in that damn field.
Did you ask him to come visit?
Why? There's no food in the house?
Well, one was for salad...
Does anybody out there want something to drink?
Nothing.
About what?
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
Grace, I don't hate your father.
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
Yeah, you know everything!!
Started what?
My period.
Who's going to want me now?
That's not true.
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.
So do you.
How's everything?
Good.
Great!
David?
Who's there?
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
Did you speak to Farlow?
Uh, yes... Sure, David.
It's me.
Hi.
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
I should be in by two.
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
Sure... What's Grace up to?
I'm sorry.
What did he say?
I should go get some of her things.
We're very lucky.
... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?
Aw... that's so sweet.
I love you.
You've got to stop doing that?
Yeah.
What did he say?
I don't understand. You just said he said no.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
You've already made arrangements!?
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
What if she doesn't want to go?
She will if you think she should.
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
I miss you, Annie.
I know. We miss you too.
Everything all right.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
How are you feeling about work?
May I have a suggestion?
Yeah, what?
Take your time.
No. I am a "tubab."
What do you mean?
I have so much to tell you.
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
It's so cruel.
No. He had the choice.
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
I was there for that shot, actually.
I'd love to go there one time...
Sounds like something Tom would say.
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
Good luck to you, Annie.
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
I understand, but Annie, please...
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
Mixed salad.
They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.
Sure. As long as she don't mind.
When you figure on branding?
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
I don't believe it.
Tom?
Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...
Why do you always wear that hat?
Would you let me ride your horse?
Have you talked to Tom about it?
I wouldn't let happen.
What does she do?
She's an editor.
That's not a question, is it?
Can you drive?
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
I can't...
I don't know if I can with my leg.
Sure?
Grace, I need you to come with me.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
You want to go to a movie tonight?
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
Do you want to go around by the old road?
Jude, you okay?
No, not yet.
Dad! I can do it, OK?!
Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?
You want to watch some television?
What, sweetheart?
Did you notice -- no cane?
I know. Amazing.
IT WAS MY TURN!
Don't be such a baby!
You just showing off for her!
I can't believe it's the same horse.
We still have a way to go.
Hey, darlin'.
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
What are you looking at, young man?
You ever miss it?
Where did you learn all this stuff?
Now that's cool.
Cool?
Yeah, cool.
You think it's cool?
Secret Service!
Welcome to our show!
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Let's keep her.
What's that?
What's that?
Shit!
Right.
Very impressive.
Hold on a second!
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
That's far out!
Ta-da!
Snoop onto them...
Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
I want it to have my children!
One-handed!
Cereal.
Yeah?
Go fix the phones.
Who's that?
Curtis.
Dade?
I'm taking over a TV network.
Mm-hmm.
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
How was school?
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
I told you, I don't play well with others.
Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
I found it! I found it!
Crash Override.
Yo, showtime, showtime!
That's Razor and Blade.
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
What's this one eat?
Oh, shit! He got me.
Yes!
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
Think you can do better?
What the hell is going on?
He's not in this class.
I said give me time.
What?
What the hell are you doing?
It's cool, I'm just looking.
It has a killer refresh rate.
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
Yeah.
Are you challenging me?
And if I win?
Make it my first born.
Make it our first date.
You're not gonna win.
Thank you.
Okay. I'll copy it.
Kate, listen.
Uh, hold on...
Why did he come to you?
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
How?
Shit!!
There they are!
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
Ready?
Yeah.
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
Dade.
Oh, wow, she's great.
You look good in a dress.
You would have looked better.
Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
Gill.
We caught 'em.
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
Mr. Belford?
Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...
Joey, Joey...
Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
Hey! What are you guys doing in here?
What is he doing in here?
Hello?
Hey, it's me.
A hacker planted the virus.
What the hell was that all about?
Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
What is it? What's wrong?
Send a Flu-shot.
Thank you.
What number please?
555-4202.
Just one moment.
You're late.
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
Real charmer.
I'll take you down there.
My parents baby-sitter canceled.
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
When did you find this out?
Don't get angry.
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?
So?
I don't know Brady.
Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
Are you two okay?
We've been better.
What's going on?
Michael Myers.
Who's that?
Not without Jamie.
Is there another key?
What does that mean?
Brady!
Get back!
Shit!
Brady! Come with us.
Go!
Brady!
Brady!
Get up there Rachel!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
An accident?
It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
Mom, please
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
Can't you find somebody else?
How do we look?
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
How do you know their not?
Why wasn't I notified?
I don't want to have anyone live through that night again.
Why shouldn't I?
Four plus Myers.
Yes.
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
Has he been prepped?
I do.
Outside.
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
Night Doc.
Got it Earl.
Kido. It's four in the morning.
Do you love me Rachel?
Jamie, sometimes it's...
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
Come on Rachel.
Jamie, what happened?
It was the nightmare man
Come on Rachel!
I thought you said you were ready.
Jamie, wait for me.
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
Can we go home soon Rachel?
Jamie!
Rachel come on.
No.
I can't.
What are you doing out here alone?
We'll hear sirens soon.
Then we'll be safe?
Why?
You remember Lindsay don't you?
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
I don't want to look pushy.
You won't come on too strong.
Call me.
Hell of a night.
Its not over yet.
Leave Myers for the state boys.
Right here, Ben.
You look sharp. You understand?
You got your riot gun?
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
Get the outside shutters.
Making sure that no one can get in here.
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
I am. Ben Meeker.
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
He's here, Sheriff.
Something?
He's been here.
Oh Christ. Doc...
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.
Where's that Deputy?
These kids aren't likely to forget.
Car trouble?
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!
Okay.
Now you understand?
Jamie! Get away!
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
Hi, Dad. What happened?
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
You're going to be late!
Why didn't you wait for me?
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
It's been totally charted.
We just talked.
Saving the treats for Bob?
I have a place for that.
Look.
Look where?
He was standing right here.
Why did you hang up on me?
Annie, was that you?
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
Sure, see you later.
You still spooked?
I wasn't spooked.
Probably Mister Riddle.
He can still watch.
Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
I can't.
Get him out of here!
You locked yourself in.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
Yes.
That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to...
Fantastic. Totally.
Yeah.
Want a beer?
Yeah.
Is that all you say?
Yeah.
Go get me a beer.
We're all alone, aren't we?
I gotta go.
Yeah, sure.
Promise?
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
A man wouldn't do that...
I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.
Jesus!
You all right?
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
Isn't that David Graham? He's cute.
Okay. Later.
Hey, Laurie...
Are you coming over tonight?
Same time, same place.
Yes, I am.
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
I don't like that story.
Not any more.
Why are they under there?
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
There is no such thing.
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
There was no one outside.
There WAS.
Promise?
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
Who is it?
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
I'm scared...
It's the bogyman, isn't it?
Are you sure?
Yes.
How?
I killed him...
Laurie, you come with us...
Yes, she is.
Will you get her for me?
She's washing her clothes.
I'm not responsible, Sam.
Of course not.
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
PROBABLY going.
What did you use before?
He'll barely be able to sit up.
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
If you say so.
Ever done anything like this before?
Only minimum security.
I see.
What does that mean?
Pull up to the entrance!
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
...any sister talk?
Oh, good...
I love that.  That's my type.
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Hi.
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
Are you really interested?
What are your favorite buildings, David?
You want to see some?
Oh, yeah.
Well, let's do it.
That's just --
Uh, who gets dropped first?
And then, uh, April...huh?
I know.  It's terrible!
Wow, it's the red one?
That's disgusting!
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
Oh, geez, yeah.
Well, I live downtown.
It depends on what way you want to go.
Well, sometimes, some, uh...
You're joking.
No, he called late last night.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.
Right.
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
We're actresses.
Is this your first job?
Really?  Is the food that bad?
You're Holly.
Oh, what, what do you do?
Yeah.
It's really sad.
And it ruins everything else.
We could...we could do that.
So what's the, uh, problem this time?
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
Now I ca-can't remember.
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
Like what?
Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Hi, Dusty.
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
You--  Standards and Practices?
Child molestation is a touchy subject...
Could you--
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
We--
Like, uh...?
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, Elliot!
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Oh, what, in this section of town?
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
Ohhhh!
How about you?
Oh.  Well, I live--
Yes, I do.
Yes?
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.
No!  No...
No?
Uh, yes!
Yes.
Yeah.  How are you?
I'm...all right.
e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Page a hundred and twelve.
Bye.
I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect.
Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
Oh!
I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
Oh, don't say those words!
I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
What do you expect me to say?
Not because of me, I hope.
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
I thought you weren't coming.
I almost didn't.
I didn't sleep all night.
This is not an easy situation.
That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
No.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
And you're in love overnight?
Aren't they great?
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
Great idea.
I know.
You bet.
Are you in a bad mood?
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
I don't know.
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
But, you got four children!
Are you angry with me?
I didn't say that.
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
Hi.  How's she doing?
Don't make it worse, Dad.
Oh, Mom!
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
Why should I be afraid?
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
So?
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!
How do you know?
Want some coffee or tea?
How about something to eat?
Are you sure?
Mmm...
Me?
Elliot lusts after you.
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
Like what?
Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!
Because I have to!
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
No.
No.
You've been with someone!
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
So you met somebody else?
But who?  Where did you meet him?
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
Look at this guy.
N-n-no, not that.
Hello?
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
I can't keep my mind on the show.
Like what?!  What?
But you don't have any symptoms!
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
I think they're fantastic.
Oh, great.
You look so beautiful.
Come on.
Doesn't she look pretty?
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
So how are you?
Oh, me, I'm okay.
Do you miss Frederick?
How are you?
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
Hi!  Hi!
I know...I know.
Glad you could put in an appearance.
I got two minutes.
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
He's fine.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
...you know?  I, uh...
Thanks, thanks.
Mh-hm.
That's a beauty!
Isn't that great?
Oh!
Go right over there.
Gee.
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
Well, what about artificial insemination?
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
I want to experience childbirth.
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
Hey!
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
What?  You're kidding!
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Holly, please.  Don't insult me.
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
Ohh?
Don't you think she does?
Frederick didn't come with her.
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
Oh, Hannah!
It's, uh, you never know--
He's such a loser!
Oh, he's such a loser!
Not this Thanksgiving, you know.
Ouch!
Sometimes she's terrific...
Singing?
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
Ohh!
You know.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
Awwww...
Oh, gosh.
Uh, losers!  All losers!
You're crazy!  That's not true.
Hey, what's the matter?
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
Well, why don't you share them with us?
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
Don't, no, please.  Will you-- No, don't...
Can we, can we go?
No!
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
I remember you.
Yes, you do recall, right?
How are you?
Good.  How are you?
I'm fine.
Oh, no.
Yeah?
It was a terrible evening.
I'd never do that.
...in a really horrible way.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
People change...you know.
So how are you?
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
Are you, are you out of work or something?
Have you?
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
No, you can tell me.
Come on.
Nobody ever said it.
No, the reason I ask is--
No, I haven't.
You're kidding me.
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
Well, what about me?
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
Hi.
Okay.
Just a few minutes ago.
Mickey?
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
Dad...
Hi.
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
Take our literature...
...read it over, and think about it.
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
Aren't you glad to see me?
I can't think.
...you don't have to think.
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
A reward...
I'm going to tell you later....
A reward for what?
Some museum director disappeared.
And?
They're offering... 
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
...I was <u>working</u>...
...<u>please</u>...
I have not read you your rights.
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.
Well.  Word gets around.
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
Or, perhaps...
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
Now, whyn't you help us?
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
...aren't you afraid of me...?
You want me to be?
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
...they did it for a lark.
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
Rich, comic book freaks.
And why is it a vacant exercise?
Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
No, you're wrong about Verger.
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
C'mon, pal.
You're ready now.
I'm not.
Then you tell me, then.
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
How you doin?
M'I gonna see you tonight?
That's right.
Then I'm doing fine.
I know her by the Back.
What, What, I can't hear you...
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
How was America?
...nightmare.
They got that kind of money?
...are they hard to get?
Impossible.
Hold up a minute...
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
First things first.
You take this much time over everything?
Not with any certainty we...
<u>Do</u> it...
Where was the call from.
Somewhere in Italy.
He escaped...
He don't like popcorn.
No.  And...
I like Popcorn...
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
You give me whatever I want...?
The children...?
...they're from Baltimore....
Now, why in the world would he do that?
What reaction?
Do you know the <u>seller</u>?
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
Try Barney Clark.
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study. 
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
...young boys, still...?
...here's to child abuse!
...and then, he'll be coming down.
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
...unmarked hundreds....
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
Let the girl go.
Why?
For a consideration.
Sir:
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
...what's he got against you?
Look at this:
...what'm I looking at...?
I know you did what you could.
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
She threw a punch at a man on the team.
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
What is that supposed to mean...?
I think its meaning is clear.
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
Said what?
What'd you say, hon...?
Waited too long, hon...?  
I said how's your baby...?
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
Waal...
A wonderful country...
You know it?
I have had many excellent meals there.
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
...should love to correct your error. 
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
...your <u>scar</u>..?
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they...
I require...
I'd like to walk home with you, and...
...Franklin.
Where do you live?
We got KittyKat...
Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.
And you let her get away.
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
...spend some time on the streets.  Ask me then...
I came to pay my...
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
...may be the heat....
Can you walk?  Are your legs working...?
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
...I'm sorry....?
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
Indeed we were.
...and my need for The Institution...
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
And how did he do that?
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
Thank you, Cordell.
...but will that satisfy you?
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
<u>Yes</u>.
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
The girl could use some help.
You're <u>free</u>...
Look what they put her on...
You should get Married.
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
Because you're going to help me plan a party.
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
What was it.  What was it, honey?
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
...what...?
No.
Every suicide kills two.
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
What would you guess, Ardelia?
You goin to shoot yourself? 
Don't shoot yourself.
Give me your gun...
...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are <u>expensive</u>...
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
No.  Invite us?  No, he simply...
Then we cannot go.
Because...?
"Because we don't have any money."
....because we don't have any mmm...
Ask me when we get home.
...and then, we're going to <u>Greece</u>...
Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
...what did you want? 
I know where he is.
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
I know where he is.
What shape is the scar?
I want the money.
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
Thank you.
Or clear your windshield with it.
I know it well.
What're they on about?
They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
Brazilian. 
...a <u>liaison</u> position...
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
She must be something special After Dark.
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
I don't <u>think</u> so.
Then what brings you back?
No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
Yes.
Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
...would you use a small word?
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
I..
You want some <u>advice</u>.
He was <u>shot</u>...he was shot.  On his rounds.  And... and...
And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
Believe me, I wish I knew less.  Oh, if you weren't such a pig...
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
Now what? What did I do this time?
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
Talia, don't go!
Wha-at?  What is it?
Go stand by the flagpole.
No, they're not from Wendy.
That would be a No.
I didn't realize I had to declare a major.
I'm not a nai-ive little...
You'll be hiding behind a tree.
I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl.
...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...
What in the hell did you do that for?
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
Oh you know, Bosnia, the importance of the right to vote...
Yeah. I guess I do.
I think your passion is terrific.
Do you really not believe in God?
What else don't you believe in?
I love you. Don't say I love you, too. I hate that--"love you, too."
Do you really think we're fooling anyone?
What do you want me to say?
God, you're beautiful.
Sorry Veronica.
I don't believe it. I'm winning.
Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.
It's not my style, okay?
Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
Hey really, I don't feel so great.
Oh, I have to hear this.
Take a break Veronica, sit down.
So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
Because you're an idiot.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
Because you're an idiot.
Something like that. Will you do it?
Things are going to change, Earl.
I'll think about it.
Sawyer. Guess what today is?
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
You stupid cunt!
Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
What are you doing here?!
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.
God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something.
Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
Maybe you should see a doctor.
Guess who?
No.
Veronica, you look like hell.
God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
No way, no day!
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
That was seriously warped, Veronica.
Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.
Chick-en.
Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.
And your worst enemy.
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
"I die knowing no one knew the real me."
Mute!
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.
Do you take German?
I did not want them <u>dead</u>.
Did to.
Did not.
Did to.
Can't you see this is a special moment?
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
You can be so immature!
You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.
You're still not listening! I'm not..
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
If you'll excuse me......
You really fucked me up, Veronica.
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.
Let's kick his ass.
Cool off, we're seniors.
Is it sleeping, dude?
I guess.
How was the funeral?
Everyone take their places on the stage!  Isn't this thrilling?!
Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
I adore anything to do with the arts.
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
Come on! Sausage rolls.
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.
I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.
wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
Can I go now?
Well, I guess I take after you then!
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
You have to let me go!
You have it.
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
looks startled at the outburst.
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
Oh-what a nice outfit!
But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper!
Mummy!
She's terribly hurt . . .
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!
It doesn't matter.
I think I'm dying . . .
To be known as He!
This.
That.
What?
It's so beautiful!
You're such an incredible woman.
You'll never guess what's happened!!
John has fallen in love with me!
How do you know? Did he tell you?
Let's go overseas . . .
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
But that's not true! I've got one.
I'm coming with you.
Mummy!
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
Bye, Dad.
Are you a dream too?
Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?
Your insight is enlightening.
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?
Of course, yes.
The way you just looked at me...
Hint. It's not a geographical location.
I'm stumped.
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Second most common?
Skin cancer.
Eighty third most common.
Pitbull attacks.
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
Sure plenty of times.
Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things.
Yeah, how's that?
I have my connections
Really? Do tell.
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
What's the occasion?
Yeah? You and who else?
Hello I'm Dr...
Have we met?
Who's Allison?
What did you just say?
I said she's been missing for-
You could say that.
Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
What's wrong, Trev?
Good boy.  Where's is it?
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
Uh... eighty two?
You win! Okay pull over.
What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
Really, why's that?
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
Where's my wife?
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
I don't work here.
What do you want?!
Two.
You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
Are you ready?
Wait... what the hell is this...
... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac.
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
Hey. Can I borrow something?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
What have I done?  I was dirt poor and useless... but I was honest.
I dunno.  It was... an impulse. Me, wearing my good shoes.
What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What is this?
I got your bail continued.
"Anticipation of incarceration"?
He gives a good report and I walk?
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Often, uh.
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
Turn that thing off.
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
"The Nomm"?  What's that?
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
Were you in it?  In the war?
You never saw that picture, huh?
Here.  Get off here.
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
I... no... I don't have the right... I...
Vietnam!
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
John, I know all about it.
What're we talking about?  Reach out for what?
We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
What is it?
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
This guy LaPlante won an award?
Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
We're piecing together different accounts and...
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something.
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
Upset!  What's he upset about?
She wants to quit?
It's not unthinkable.
He lost a shoe!
You were in bed.  Weren't you?
My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!
Oh my God!  Bernie!
Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?
Never reach out!
He's pretty... remarkable.
You didn't... get it on with him?
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
What about?
Hey, c'mon.
Give it here, Bernard.
So where are all your toys?
Let's watch some TV.
Are you being helped, sir?
I'm looking for some perfume.
Any particular brand?
Well, it's for a woman.
-- hospital.
Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.
As long as you keep remembering why.
-- a sense of proportion.
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
Well, can I make an appointment?
Yeah, that was easy.
Do you do washing machines, too?
Everything breaks at once.
Isn't that always the way?
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.
About what?
Baby, what is it?
I'm thirsty.
It's the middle of the night, sweetie.
A man scared me.
A man?  Was it a dream?
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
Have you just plain asked him?
I've asked him what's wrong.
Rita, he's only twelve years old,
Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
I could take a cab on the way home.
Has anyone seen Rudolf?  I don't think he came in last night.
Neil, you could have burned the house down!
No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
What's that?
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
I know it's at the high end of our range --
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
But it's what we want.
You could have a pool to cool off in.
It's a nice pool, isn't it?
How were we -- were we cool?
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
Did you hear that?
He made, you know, a remark.
How was lunch?
How was your lunch with Charlie?
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
No.
I hear things in this house,
No, I'm not kidding you, <u>Philip</u>.
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
The cab's waiting!
He wants to see me!
Philip!  The senior partner?
He wasn't there.
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
That's not the case.
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
Who was that?
I'm having the floor fixed,
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
I think it's time I came home now.
It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
How large is your brood?
God, your sister's really hot.
Let's follow 'em.
What for, dickweed?
It's fun.
Are we gonna buy this house?
Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!
I have a cold.
What did the thermometer say?
Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come from, huh?
A <u>man</u> started the fire.
Do you see a man?
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
And this -- is the master bedroom.
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
Is it a king or a queen?
It's a double.
Even better.
I'd like that.
Would you?
Really?
Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
What do you think?
You didn't see this.  Understand?
Tough.
This ties in with Nash.
We don't have any proof of that.
He had to come from somewhere.
I think it was England.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
Detective Bedsoe.
Lieutenant.
When did you get back?
Where were you last night around nine?
I already told you.  I took a walk.
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
No.  I don't scare easy.
Around.
She was a good woman.
No.
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
Yes -- I think it is.
No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
Must you do that?
What?
The river.
That's all?
That is what bothers me.
I'm leaving.
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
Maybe myself.
I'm sure they will.
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
France.
What are we doing here?
To ask her to dance.
She's the King's cousin.
Yes.
What worries you?
No.  What am I to do?
Well?
I'll go first.
No -- I will.
I stood up first.
That doesn't matter.
You can go first.
It will be a good harvest this year.
Can you really tell from doing that?
What do you think?
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
She's a treasure she is.
How comes it your are not afraid?
Your life.
We had a bargain.  You promised.
Different places.
The past?
Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
I cannot stay.
Why not?
Leaving?  For how long?
Why?
I cannot explain.
Do you love me, Conner?
Aye.
Then take me with you.
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
Are you a cop?
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
What do you want?
Yes.  How did you know?
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
If it's good advice.
This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
You're hurt.
Because it's my name.
Then who's Russell Nash?
Why do you stare at me like that?
I don't have any answers for you.
Who was that man last night?
I don't know.
Do you always walk around with a sword?
I'm interested in mythology.
No.
Yes.
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
Good evening.
You're twenty minutes late.
You didn't answer my question.
I'm just trying to place you.
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
Is it?
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
No.
That would mean they'd been trapped in there--
Would you like to see it?
I've seen it.
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
Where will you go now?
It will end tonight.
Must you fight him?
He's in there!
Be careful, Conner.
We found him this morning.
It has to be.
You stayed here again last night?
I was working on the cataloging.
It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
I am stronger than you, Highlander.
That's what the Kurgan said.
No.
Is there anything else you need?
Would you care for some water, Conner?
Don't leave us, Conner.
You kept it?
Fine.
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
I think he's dead!
That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
I guess so.
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
You get anything on Smith?
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
You think we should take that chance?
The car.  All you want is the car?
I'm going to my desk.
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
That woman's gonna call the cops.
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
It's over.  We have to give up.
Then we might as well die rich.
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
How about the cop?
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
Talley?
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
Okay.
Let me come get him.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
Who else is here?
Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
Use more ice.
What about my father?
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
We can take it with us.
The cops are comin'!
I got the gasoline --
What the fuck is that?
You have his address?
Donuts here any good?
Are you out of your mind?
Give me an ETA.
What if it goes south?
What hospital?
Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
Where is it?
Can we talk some more when you get here?
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
I'm scared shitless.
Ow!  Shit!
No one's coming.
That big asshole nailed my windows.
You leave that gun alone!
Want one?
What do you want?
Kevin left without you.
You'd better get out of here!  Kevin's coming back!
Please get away from me.
Thanks for the shirt.
Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
Are civilians inside?
We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
What are we going to do about Mike?
What's going on?
Smith!  Wake up!
Just one question.  Please.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
That's enough.
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?
That's not enough.
Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered the door.
Louise?
Louise?
I know the one.
Chief, base.
I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
You have her cell number?
Did you find Jane and Mandy?
What's wrong with the radio?
I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?
He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
I want to know what in hell you're doing.
Let it go, Captain.
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
It's right in front of us.
Chief, Mikkelson.
It's mine.  Talley.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
Are all of you named Jones?
What's my name?
We've got to get those kids out of there!
The kids are in here!
Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?
How about you and your sister?
We're okay.
Where are you right now?
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
Can you open them?
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.
Who is it?
Are the disks still in your room?
Where are my children?
Did you find the disks?
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
Where's your gun?
Who are you?
These disks . . . where are they?
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
What do you mean by that?
Paul, Paul, a moment please.
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
We, who is we?
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
What is this about?
You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
Please, I don't use guns.
How much?
Name a price.
How many in your family?
Ten.
I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
Have you requested re-enforcements?
Yes we have.
What was the response?
Paul, you know who this is?
Anything. Strong.
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
They fired a rocket at us.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
Will you protect us.
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
He did.
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
Where are my supplies?
I'll be over.
We must go to the Diplomat.
Get in.
Your police are at the gate?
What do you mean, General?
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
We are better here.
You are a marked man.
I am on a list! What list?
I led no massacres.
You think they will believe you?
You will tell them the truth.
Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.
Business is good at the hotel?
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
) You cannot kill them all.
Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
Holy shit! Holy shit.
You fucking see that!
Here, have a sandwich.
Great, I really need a shower.
The fifth room is your broadcast room.
When will they be here?
Very soon.
There are no more rooms.
Mr. Manager.
Get out of this room and get back to work.
For supplies, you drive.
The fog is too heavy, sir.
Are you sure this is the river road?
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
They moved you from the Diplomat?
Can we phone them in, Paul?
Perfect timing.
I would never do that.
This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
You are the manager?
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
What do you want?
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
The commander is not here.
He will be here.
Excuse me.
What?
Our cards, please.
What cards?
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.
I will need a suite.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
Pack the bags, we have to move.
Your brother's here?
Thomas wants advice?
He wants your wisdom.
Let's have dinner first.
Do something.
No.
I couldn't help.
The president has been murdered.
Where are Thomas and Fedens?
I sent them home. Go and call them.
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
Please, Paul, 'til first light.
Oh, my God!
What is it, Paul.
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
This won't do.
Has Roger spoken yet?
No, Odette says he's in shock.
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
You could leave, Paul.
Go to the roof now.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
So where is the lamb?
Go out! Where?
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
It was substantial.
Tell me what it was.
What does it matter.
A Volkswagen.
I will not leave without the twins.
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
I have to stay.
Let me go. Children get off.
I love you. Keep the children safe.
We are almost out of water.
We have to have a plan.
The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.
I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
Rutaganda's place?
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
You have taken business class?
Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.
Twelve are dead.
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
He has taken the presidential suite.
What are you doing?
Where has all our beer gone?
How much beer?
When?
What is this about no water?
All. What do you mean all?
The staff, the guests.
Paul, are you there?
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
No, I don't want you going on the street.
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
There are soldiers.
Where?
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
What is his room number?
I don't know.
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
So what stopped her?
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
And how the hell are we going to do that?
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
Jesus H. Christ!
Looks like we're it.
Melissa!
What?
Three times, to be exact.
Where is it??
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
This thing's going nowhere.
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.
-- I did: down here.
Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
What's in there?
Hey! Where'd you guys go?
-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!
What's down there?
Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
Oh. Jesus.
Uhhhh...
Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
If you know where it is, get there!
Pritchett, is that you?
Pritchett!
I'll meet you down there.
Prove it.
Is she...alright?
I'm better than that.
Most fun I've had all day.
Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
I don't think so...
We can do it...
I was upstairs with Eddie --
-- that's the fact, bud --
-- you lose either way, Price --
Good point.
Or an on-line computer.
That's crazy!
This is the best we're gonna do.
It's okay, everything's okay now.
Don't think it's even an issue.
What --
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
Where did it go?
Run.
What?
...Jesus H. Christ.
Could we have a word?
-- just not always in the sexual sense.
You're hurting me.
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
-- the sadistic prick --
So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?
Where is she?
-- I pose you the same question --
If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last --
-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
Jesus!
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
Evelyn... Get up... NOW!
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
You didn't think to ask?
I was in the middle of --
You think this is fucking funny??
No, no, it's just --
What?
Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?
Your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it."
And then what happens?
Please! Something! Oh-God!
-- even if I give you a million as well?
-- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.
He was right! Pritchett was right!
Good way to get your head blown off.
What is it??
I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.
I was upstairs!
I'll take my chances.
Then tell me, please -- help me...!
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Please! I need your help.
Houston, I think we may have a problem.
-- it wasn't me.
Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
Wish I could take the credit, but --
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
Of course he did, for God's sake.  Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?
Oh, no.
Don't know that it does.
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
Won't do any good.
Blackburn's dead.
Price!
Pritchett: what is going on?
He must've unsealed the room!
-- hey! --
-- Eddie!!
Please.....anyone....help me?
For the love of God....please...?
Sara...?
Keep talking, I'll find you!
Something....happened --
-- I'm coming --
I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...
Damn it.
What was her name?
It might have been her mother.
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
It looks delicious...
Did you find her?!
Are you all right?
A few years older, perhaps.
It will heal.
I'm sorry.
Good-bye.
By freeing them.
Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
Don't play games with me, little girl.
I didn't do anything, mommy.
Well then who did?!
Maybe it was Colleen...
Can you talk to her?
My angel!
Are we leaving mommy?
Where are we going to go, mommy?
We're going to go someplace new.
What about all my other stuff?
Your father doesn't love us anymore!
She says she's lonely...
Where is she?
She's here.
Where is she now?
She's down.  Help her...
Can I have this room daddy?
Sure.  Did you see the others?
What's he doing daddy?
He's blessing the house.
Look daddy!  It's empty!
Mommy please help me!
Don't be afraid!
Oh my God!  She's in there!
Are we going back to California daddy?
Good night Angel...
I just, I don't know...
What will Aubrey think?
It's just going to take a while.
To our family.
I wish I knew more about her.
What the hell is that?
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
...set up some more things.
What is it?
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...
So what are you saying?
But do you agree with me?
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
Well, I try to keep an open mind, but...
Oh come on!
It just disappeared.  Literally.
Whoa there...
What are you talking about?
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
How are we doing?
I think everything's ready.
Oh my God where is she!
She's gone!
Aubrey!
I'm fine.
You don't think I know?
Are you all right?
You're bleeding.
Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
Maura.
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
You must be a Londrigan.
Oh, that's nice...
Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.
Your daughter's been taken.
She's coming back.  Keep talking!
You must be the new tenants.
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
Thank you.
This isn't happening...
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
How long will it take!
Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  Maybe some kind of a rodent.
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
Where did you find this?
Do you mind if I borrow it?
There's something in there.
What?
There's something through that wall!
Right.  Like last night's doozie.
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
So where is it?
It was off the statue.  In the club.
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.
Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
What is it?
Why are you so interested?
That's great.
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
How have you ... ?
And he still sits there?
Every day.
Would you know this store again?
Sure.  Why?
Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
Terri?
Buying some drugs, alright?
What am I looking for?
No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ...
What else came with it?  Anything still here?
Can we see?
You gonna buy?
Welcome. 38
You're JP Monroe, right?
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
Yes really.
Wow.  Thank you.
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
How do we start?
Joey?
Not quite.
Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?
Really?
Oh, I don't ...
I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.
That was beautiful.
Eighth room down, babe...
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
That's your definition of "Hard?"
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....
The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last time I played the game, Simpson only had a 40.
This isn't funny.  I'm not into this.  I...
There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.
You got about five minutes and change.
"A mule is an animal with long funny ears."
"And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo."
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
Rio, Alex?  After all they've done to...Hey, these tickets are for Moscow!
We're going in from the ground floor.
Count of three?
Why not just go now?
"Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money.
Now that's a lock.
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
Anna, I think you better stay....
"We all had our quarrels and parted..."
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
Welcome to Rome, sir.
My life is not some deal.  I...
Welcome back to Vinci.
Don't you just hate kids...
What the hell....
A little petting is not the issue!
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
Tough guy.  What are you--How's your head.
Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....
Prison?
I was the Warden?
How long were you in?
What have you been doing?
tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.
Catholic girls are scary...
I hope you know what....
Trust Leonardo....
Cat got his tongue?
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
No, let me!
We're here to say, your government was right.
What a pleasant surprise.  You're probably wondering...
Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
Yes.
Remember that shoe you lost...
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
Get away from there, convict!
Don't be stupid...they...
Bastard!  If you were a true American.
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
I'm supposed to fall for that?
Why does this have to be so hard...
We'll call it the Flying Donut!
The Dancing Dingus!
Something short.
Sharp.
With a little jazz.
The Shazzammeter!
The Daddy-Oh!
The Hoopsucker!
The Hudswinger!
The Hoop-dee-doo!
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
Who are you? How did you know who I am?
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
Adenoids?
He didn't offer you money.
A sawbuck!
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
What a horrible little person.
You're from Muncie?!
-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!
...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?
...You know! For kids!
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
I know that, Amy.
...Huh?
You know, on farm route 17.
Oh yes! In Muncie!
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
Now, Amy --
...You son of a --
Norville!
Phony, huh?
As a three-dollar bill.
Muncie.
Watch it, Archer --
You can't print that!
Just got hired today!
Terrific.
Ya know, entry level!
Tell me about it.
I got big ideas, though!
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
How long've you been down here?
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
What the heck's she doin', Lou?
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
This I know, Benny.
...Geez.
...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
My pleasure, sir.
...Why, this is worthless.
Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
...You don't?
Nah, that's all forgotten.
Say, that was a swell idea!
But, Buzz, you know I never --
And Sid says you stole it!
Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
...This'll only take a moment.
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
...Who let you in?
...education, were you?
Well, I'm a college graduate --
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 'Lamebrain'?
No, sir.
Not even behind your back?
You're fired.
But, sir! --
My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
Not that way! Through the door!
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
My God! The Bumstead contracts!
I got gas, Bennie.
Yeah, tell me about it.
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
Ya get the special?
...Enter the dame.
There's one in every story.
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
...and awduhs a light lunch.
...No money.
...He's not noticing, Benny.
Maybe he's wise.
He don't look wise.
Yellowstone.
Old Faithful.
Hello, Niagara.
She's got other problems, of course...
...Her mother needs an operation...
...adenoids.
Maybe he's wise.
She isn't!
She's good, Bennie.
Good morning, miss.
She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
Things so bad, nobody can help -- not even Doctor Maxwell.
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
Where?
At the Houmfort.
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
I think you need some help.
I'm afraid so.
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
She can never be cured?
I've never heard of a cure.
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
You're single?
Yes.
But it's so far away...
Thank you.  But who sits there? 
I went to school in Buffalo.  Paul went to school in England.
Where do you think you're going?
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
But don't you have to work?
Bring me another, Ti-Joseph.  I have to keep the lady entertained.
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
Don't let it bother you so, Wes.
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.
It is not beautiful.
I am not a frightened girl.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
A mental case?
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
I suppose so.  Yes.
And charming?
Good morning, Miss Connell.
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
I heard you playing.
I wanted to help you.
She was beautiful.
I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
You want that?
I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.  It'll pass.  We've had this sort of thing before.
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.
You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?
Right o'.
Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
OK, OK, the defense rests.  Want another?
You're staring at me.
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
Good night.
The Halfords have invited us again this year.
You want to go?
What do you think?
I'm, uh, going to bed.
So early?
I do. I'm -- are you...?
I... I think I am...
The turkey in?
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
Yeah, that one.
What's for dessert?
See for yourself.
Don't start.
You think I --
I have no idea.
What do you mean?
Don't be dim.
Elena, what are you're talking about?
It's a starting place.
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
You've...
This just isn't the best moment for this.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
You're not going to --
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
Ready to go?
I'll drive you --
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
The phone's out.
So how's school treating you?
All right.
Classes?
Good.
Grades?
Fine.
Anyone special? You know...
Sure dad.
See you.
Libbets. Libbets Casey.
Ben--
Huh?
Birth control.
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
A prior engagement overcame me.
Good-night dad.
Nah.
What the hell are you kids doing down here?
Your toes cold?
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?
But...
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
It's what?
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
Thank you Janey.
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.
You okay?
Sure. Maybe coffee.
With Mikey?
Who?
Nobody.
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
They need the money for my band uniform at school.
I don't like coffee.
Please don't.
It's not a bother.
Oh.
It's really quite all right.
I used to know how to cook.
Social work?
How'd you know?
Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
Yes, it was -- I ended up --
They say you never forget.
Forget what?
-- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
You ask what the point is?
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
But not too ashamed.
Now you are being rude.
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
How can you do that man?
Aha! I could sense the vibe.
What do you mean?
Am I right or am I right?
Huh?
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
Awesome sleet and rain.
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Hey.  I'll take this stuff.
You going to tell dad?
No!
Great, thanks for the tip.
Frankie opens them with his teeth.
Well, uh, I don't, it's really --
Maybe you should have just a half.
Yeah but you don't even know me really.
It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
No one.
Mikey?
Yeah?
Geometry?
Why are you so good at math but not in English?
Out.
Want some gum?
Sure.  Twinkie?
Did you tell Sandy?
I don't ever want to see you.
You have to follow me?
Why did you -- with Sandy?
I don't know.
Wow!
When worlds collide.
Huh?
You're parents at that party?
Yeah. Yours?
You get in trouble?
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
Hood residence.
Charles, what time is it?
Is this Charles?
What time is it?
Hey Wendy.
Hey Sandy.
Mikey was looking for you.
All my model planes.
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
What are you doing?
Yeah.
Are you his girlfriend?
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
Want a drink?
Vodka?
It feels warm.
One more shot?
I love you.
That's nice. Are you drunk?
I don't know. How do I know?
Yes, sir.
Didn't want to miss anything.
Just after Leland Street.
What's the D.A. got them on?
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
Will, you can't blame yourself.
I had him!
I have to get back.
You did your homework, Officer.
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
Typical seventeen year-old.  She went to a party Friday night?
We already did.
Do it again.
This murder was in the papers, right?
She your only sibling?
I don't remember.
It's legitimate.
I know.
What about your shoulder?
Sorry about...
What I saw?
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
No.
What time was that?
Who was the last one to see her alive?
We're sure it's hers?
What are you doing here?
Forget your pager?
Where you signed this?
That's right.
How do you mean?
Eight years.
What do you want to talk about?
To do nothing.
You know I remember that.
One word to I.A. and he walks.
Well her mother didn't buy them for her.
Your friend's all business.
I'm not expecting anyone.
That's not what he thinks.
Will...I...
Did you love her?
Huh?
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
Stuff.
What kind of stuff?
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
The other guy?
I told you I don't remember.
How should I know?...
Ran like hell to go to him...
I don't know.
You don't know.
Thought I smelled something.
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
I was her best friend.
Best friend?
Since grade school.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
You want me to take you somewhere?
Hey...
You and Kay were like sisters?
You don't know.
She wouldn't tell me!
Who?
She used some stupid code name.
What was it?
No game.
She was only seventeen.
But she was an attractive girl.
I suppose.
No.
But you wanted to.
Yes.
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
What about him?
Randy Stetz is in jail.
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
There's nothing more to talk about.
I told you that was an accident!
Then so was mine...
Don't you pull that shit with me.
This an accident, Walter?
Where's your back-up?
No back-up.
Wild card.
Monstrous.
Yes, and very beautiful.
Are you the leader of tis group?
So you have the answers...
Ah! You have questions?
What are we?
Who made us what we are?
That is a picture, nothing more.
Then there is nothing.
And perhaps this is the only real evil left...
Then God does not exist...
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
I was waiting for you...
Your lover.
No, my beloved, my child.
That's what the one who made me said.
Where is she? Where's Claudia?
Not without Claudia. Where is she?
And yet you knew what I would o.
I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
Why always on this night?
I didn't realise.
Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
And if I cut my hair again?
Stop her Louis!
Not you my dear.
Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
Don't Louis --
Louis, put me in my coffin...
I want more.
How did you learn to write, Claudia?
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
He jests.
Claudia! You did that?
Claudia - don't -
We're immortal. You've always known that.
Don't mock, Claudia...
Louis, look at me.
It can't be -
The ship is sailing wihout us!
How do I look?
Or her, or her - or any of them?
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
This is no performance.
This is monstrous!
Do you think I would let them harm you?
He can protect us, Claudia.
But if she dies...
They would have killed you -
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
Give it to me!!!
How do you mean, start?
Let's call that a start.
I can't do it.
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
You really want to be with them?
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
Did I hear a yes?
You're sure?
Come, you're going to feed now.
Take him.
The crucifix -
What have I done?
Dear God, what have I done?
I know. It gets cold so fast.
But how do you know?
Read her thoughts.
Paris? You came from Paris?
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
The girl, Lestat -
NO!!!
She's here, your wounded one.
What are you saying?
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
No... You come back to me Louis...
Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
I have to go now Lestat...
It's just a room...
Well, what a lucky break for me.
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
You said the slave had a crucifix...
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
The story about stakes through the heart?
What about coffins?
You loved Yvette...
Can a vampire feel love?
But why did you tell her?
How could I not? She had to know.
No... it can't end like that...
And the child who did die?
What can I do for you?
You're in 201 and 202.
What about a radio?
Sorry. Emergencies only.
Listen to me. He's here.
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
Stupid. Stupid.
No.
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
I thought you were out of town!
Say yes.
No.
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
He's not coming. I thought he was just...
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
I'm the King of the World.
Hello? Hello?
Karla! You promised.
Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
Karaoke -- perfect.
Don't even think about it.
No way.
No.
Yes.
Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
Karla!
Let him go. I believe him.
There's no way to lock it.
I don't know...
I'm holding your hand!
No, you're not.
You're okay. Thank god.
I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?
Yeah.
Ray, I can't...
Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry.
I love it here.
Checking the locks again?
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.
Who?
Voodoo.
Don't kill me --
Julie! Wait! You okay?
I'm fine.
You sure?
I'm fine.
To get out of Southport?
I'm okay.
This was not my idea.
You sure it's okay with you?
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
It's...him.
What do you mean, Julie?
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
What? What are you talking about? Where?
There was a body! I swear it!
Come on. We're gonna be okay.
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
He's in it with Willis?
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
Is there a problem here?
Oooh, the mainland --
Guess the capital of Brazil --
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
You think that's a good place to hide?
Julie, is everything cool? Karla said...
To a great weekend --
Ahh, that feels great.
Why? He can't help us.
Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?
Rio de Janeiro!
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
Jeez, that's a full carat --
Well, there's some flaws in her...
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
You guys lost?
What's the matter, boy trouble?
Not anymore.
He leave you?
And so could you -- crazy fool.
You stumbled into my hiding place.
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
How's the water?
Take this.
We'll only be a second, okay?
Where'd Estes go?
What is up with that weirdo?
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
) You feel the symptoms?
Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.
No.  She shall not be left here.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
Good night, Oliver.
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
Oh, no - it's too delicious! You're making it up!
Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
Poor child. These must be horrible days for you.
Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
She has never mentioned her family.
What are you doing?
Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
Shh it's all right - I'll be all right.
You are fortunate in your father.
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
What is it -- what are you talking about?
I have forgotten it, dear.
But one must love a father.
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
You were father's secretary - I never thought - -
You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you - I'll warn them against you.
You wouldn't tell that 
No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
Her name is Thea?
Theodosia.
Your daughter is ill.
She's not too well.
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
There's no one there - nothing but the caves and the dead.
There is something evil about her.
It makes me fear her.
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay.
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
We still don't know that it's the plague 
Thea is so like her  in every feature 
Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle -
Listen to what I say --
You're crying. Why?
I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
Please.. You shouldn't laugh --
Thea, what's wrong?
Well, tell, him.
I can't.
Why in the world can't you?
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.
Get that ladder up here.
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
Good morning, sir.
Carter  bank examiner.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Go through with what?
Oh, no.
Well, who are you, then?
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
What?
Yes, George?
Where's Mary?
Well, naturally. Of course.
Hey, who's that?
That's your problem, George Bailey.
Who is it?
What's that book you've got there?
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen  that's Violet Bick!
I know. I know.
Hey, Ernie!
Hiya, George!
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
Is this the place?
Oh  Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
Mother . . .
Well, sure I do.
When'd you see him last?
Hi, Daddy.
Well, what happened to you?
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
There it is, good as new.
It will?
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
Hee-haw!
What boat you sailing on?
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
Oh  Welch. That's what I get for praying.
Oh, no  you don't feel so good.
I'm all right.
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Uh-huh.
Hmmmm . . .
Hmmm . . .
Oh, stop that grunting.
Sure  Sam Wainwright.
Hmmm?
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
George! George!
Is it a charge, sir?
Yes  charge.
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
Aw, get going!
No . . . No . . . No. . .
Aw, forget it.
Oh, it's wonderful.
Yes, you bet.
You want a martini?
Okay  all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.
He's pretty young for that job.
Well, no younger than I was.
Maybe you were born older, George.
Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.
Got a match?
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
Come on, George, let's hurry.
Oh, am I glad to see you.
Hello, George, how are you?
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
Two cents worth of shoelaces?
Hey, George . . .
Hello, Georgie-Porgie.
What gives?
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Say hello to New York for me.
Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
Some other time, George.
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
Hello.
Yes, hello? George . . . it's Potter.
George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there.
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
Now look, did you buy anything?
Pop!
I'd like to do that.
Yes, sir.
Made up your mind yet?
With coconuts?
I'm not very good at this.
Neither am I.
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.
You may kiss my hand.
Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
In that place?
Oh, no.
Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.
How's that?
Have you made up your mind?
Tuesday.
Where'd you get that dress?
Would you rather leave?
No, I don't want to be rude.
Oh . . . yeah, yeah. That's all right.
Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
After that, who cares?
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .
Please, let's not stop, George.
Have fun.
Hi.
To keep from being an old maid.
Is it snowing?
Where's your coat and hat?
What is it, a sore throat or what?
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
Where're you going?
Mary! Mary!
Oh, George, George, George.
You have no idea what's happened to me.
I guess you forgot something.
Huh?
You forgot something.
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
How about that one there?
How fast does this go?
With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
You can?
Come on, you guys.
For me...?
Great!  Find one for me.
My hair's getting wet!
When do we get to the lighthouse?
I can't wait to get there.
Sure you do -- you win either way.
Oh, shit.
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
It's okay, it's okay....
Don't!
Get on the rocks!
Yeah, it's her job.
No.
Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.
Maybe by now they are.
Turkeys!  Eat wind!
Your dad must be really pissed.
We better go back in.
Putz -- that won't be for hours.
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.
Why'd they decide to move?
Where're we going?
But the island!
We're carrying weight.
Loser sails home alone.
Throw it.
I don't know.
I thought you said she was going with us?
Let's just go sailing, okay?
Want to talk about it?
You coming up on him?
How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?
Hey!
Sean!   Catch the rope!
We're hung up here.  Snagged.
Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?
No!  It's still there!
It's still there!
Good morning!
On your own time?
I just made it up.  It means, "Get me out of there."  What the hell's that?
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
We got a helluva tide this month.
Chief?
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
If there is, develop it!
I know just where to go.
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
I can't let you take her out.
Untie that rope.
Where to?
Every day?
Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
You stay here a minute.
Oh, c'mon.
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
Michael.
I got something for you to do tomorrow.
Mike?  Is that you?
Pop.  I'm sorry.
I passed out, but I'm okay.
Sean's still out there.
What else you got?
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
May I have this dance?
Wait a minute....
Is that what it is?
Look at that:
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
The whale's mouth?
We don't know that, do we?
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.
Carcharadon Carcharias.
That's it.
Okay, so that's it.
Is there one in these waters?
And sound.
Where the hell were you?
Do I have to talk to those two?
Why?
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
Listen -- what are you doing later?
Let's get the kid home.
Mmmm.
Sean's awake.
Door's locked.
Mrs. Silvera?
Need a ride?
Hey!  That's my boss!
It's good with coffee.
Eat Cheerios.
Where's my day book?
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
Oww!
Careful.  What's wrong?
Nothing.
That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
No.
That's great.
Sean's asleep.
What?
What're you doing?
What is it?  What's the matter?
Hello, hello.  It went well, I thought.
I'm showing summer rentals.  We got a helluva season going.
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?
Did he raise the Kids?
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
That's what he said.
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.
Can I go swimming?
Some people.
Can I go with you today?
Hi Dad.
Hang on!
Is that me?
That's you.
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
What's wrong?
It killed her.  It ate her.
We're going to die.
How old is your cousin?
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
Waiting for Andy.
I want you to meet my cousin.
Mike!  Are you going out?
Did you ever see a dolphin?
Terry!  You okay?
Help!  Help!
Get a dance yet?
Nope.
Me neither.
Who'd you ask?
Tina Wilcox.
That's a crock of shit.
The wind drift is lateral.
Come on back up here!
Nope.
Give me back my hat!
Just like this.
The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light.
They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
What're we going to do in the mean time?
But first, a little juice....
And second?
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
Right after, the Kids went out?
Be careful....
How much longer?
About damn time.
What is it?
Power line.
Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
I'm not sure I can.
Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
I don't care.
Faster!  Faster!
Heading back?
I don't think she's such hot stuff.
Not tonight.
Who wouldn't.
They're turning around.
You always go with Andy.
Do I have to play with the little kids?
You're going out.
Yeah.
You're going sailing.
Maybe.
Take me.
I want to go with you!
Quiet!  Shhh!
Michael....
Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.
Yeah.
Brody's riding his tower.
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
Oh, my God....
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
Be reasonable, please....
Go on, you're tired.
Absolutely.  Good idea.
I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.
I'll need more men to look.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
It's Miller time!
You buying?
Sure am.
You see the three-quarter socket?
Aren't you suiting up, mate?
Well, don't worry about your fiancee.  We'll watch over her.
She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
Never know down there.  Helps to have a friend, sometimes.
Well, not much longer to go.
What is it, 97 days?
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Hope I make it through both.
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
Pre-opening jitters.
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.
Yeah.
My imagination isn't that good.
Honey, I gotta go.
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
Yeah, you really don't like him.
I don't like what he does.
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
Not enough loving.
Where's the rubber band?
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
What do I do now?
Take a deep breath and hold it.
That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.
Honey... you all right?
No.
Are you scared?
Damn it!
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
They just wanted to say hello.
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
It's romantic down here.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
Where are you going?
Up.
And leave me down here???
You're going down there again?
Yes.
After what happened to us?
I know I can capture it.
Here.
What's that?
Kathryn...
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Change your mind?
You want me to stay?
Finally.
How's your patient?
Recovering nicely.
Mmmm... you smell good.
They said you'd be here.
No, we'll go through here.
... Mean through the tubes?
Yes.  It's faster.
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
... He ought to put him in here.
It's too soon to move him.
So tell Calvin.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
Honey, what is it?
Michael, take deep breaths.
Come on.
I can't take water, Kathryn.
It's a shark's tooth!
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
Somebody better get down there!
That's right.
Michael, you're not going down there.
I am.  You're not.
Michael, you don't have to go down there.
You don't have to prove anything.
Are you okay?
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
Fine.  Have them do some.
Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
I thought they were clever.
I can have them walk backwards.
No, no.  That won't do.
Unhappy combination.  Most likely one's inside the other.
You can get killed!
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
You look like an orange worm.
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
We're taking that shark alive!
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
Should be coming out of it soon.
Thanks for helping.
Not at all.
Why are you?
I like it when they wake up.
So do I.  But for different reasons.
You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed.
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
I think that you and I are natural enemies.
Hello.  I think his nap's over.
Well, Doctor.  You've got your shark.
I've heard of a White that big, in Australia...
He's big as a bloody bus!
I think they'll come out now.
They still seem nervous.
He's a young one.
When did this happen?
Don't blame yourself.
Sure.
Musclehead?
Sure.  No problem.
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
Hi, Mike.
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
So, you just get here?
Massachussettans aren't.
'Course they're also so rich.
... Massachussettans aren't.
How long you staying?
I don't know, it depends.
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.
Depends on big brother.
I'm a water-skier.
Are you really?
Well, I needed a cold shower.
You were great out there!
Herpes?
I don't know, what else is there?
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
The one that goes underwater?
Yes, it's great!
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.
Isn't this fun!
Told you you'd like it.
Now what's this do?
No...  It can't be.
It's okay, Sean.
Take it up.
Take it up!
The space shuttle has landed!
Hold still, damn it!
I don't talk that way.
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!
Ahhh, ahhh...
Gotta sneeze.
Don't you dare.
Did you see that?
That?
Yes, there is goes.
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
Calvin said it was all right.
Make sure you put this back.
No, South Georgia.
What the hell's there?
Polar bears.
Polar bears in Georgia???
South Georgia, Antarctica.
Oh...
The world's southern most reaches.
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
Reach for the limit I always say.
How far away is filter number four?
Five hundred yards.
After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
I'll go with you.
What kind of trouble?
It's not closing, Mike.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
Look great, don't I?
Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
Took it this morning.
He needs a haircut.
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
Who's grown up?
Gee, it's good to see you!
Come on, let's go.
She still talking to you?
We're in love.
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
We'll shoot this with an .18, boys.
I wouldn't mind going down with her.
You want to show this?
Come on, sweetheart....
But you always let me....
Daddy, why can't I...?
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
You're welcome.  I was the one who cried.
Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee....
Can I make sandwiches...?
Yes, I did.
No way....
It sure is good to be home....
Make a list.
We need beer....
I miss him, Matt.  I still can't believe he's gone.
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
How come it's my responsibility?
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....
What the hell are we arguing about?
No fair, I'm not armed.
Then don't come any closer.
Turn it off....
No....
Off....
Close the door.
Where have you been...?
What's wrong?  What happened?
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....
You knew...?
Where's my mother?
It'll grow on you.
You caught me....
You want to try your hand at something...?
At least he doesn't have a beard....
Beginning of what?
We'll be there....
Sweet breezes...Sweet women....
What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
They won't kill it....
I hope the man knows what he's doing....
Stop that....
That....
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
I see what you're doing....
Are you all right?
The fish.  Check it....
You check it....
He heard that.
In a minute....
You can stay in my room.
Can I ride one sometime...?
I like Grandma's cooking....
No, no...It's too dangerous....
You're coming, aren't you...?
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.
Sit down, Ma....
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
You're damn right I'm serious....
I'm just getting started....
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
Oh, I didn't mean....  I'm being such a Grandma....
I didn't mean to start that....
How are you doing?
I want you to give up your work....
Mom, please don't start that again....
You could teach...You could....
You're having a good time....
I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....
I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
It's late....
You and Sean used to make....
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
There's nothing to worry about....
You hungry?
It got him....
Why'd you come out here?
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
Promise me you'll be all right....
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
It could have been an accident....
I can't....
Sure you can....
I don't know how....
It's just like driving a car....
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
How do you like flying?
What's wrong?
I'm fine.
No, you're not....
A drink with an umbrella in it....
A big one....
You're not going to bet it all....
I have two right feet.
Our little island seems to agree with you....
You're always taking time off....
I borrow it without telling him....
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
I'm sorry...I....
There's nothing to be sorry about.
You sure you don't need glasses?
I tried to tell you...I tried....
I can't....
They had them on the big one....
I have coffee in the thermos.
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
You the architect?
Hurry!
It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....
What do you mean, it'll find her?
You sure you know how to do this.
Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
Keep it steady....
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
The damn thing is going to have our asses....
Matt?
I don't know what the hell to say....
Yeah....
Still chasing fish?
Still tagging conch?
We'll be done pretty soon....
Inch by inch....
She's a tough lady....
I wish there was something I could do....
Let me speak to Ellen....
Stop farting around....
Stop busting my hump....
How many...?
Will you leave me alone...?
You tagging them...?
The readings suck....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
I made them, man....
You didn't stick them on right....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
Put me down....
They won't fight with me....
Maybe I missed you too....
Bad boy....
Forget it....
Money is money....
It's not a bad life, Jake....
He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
How many?
Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
What?
Where is everybody?
What happened to Clarence and...?
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
We don't write up anything until we're done....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
When we got the grant....
When I got the grant.....
When I signed on....
When I invited you...
We got it together, Jake....
I don't know shit about electronics....
You sure you've done this before?
And it's always worked?
What are we getting out of this old bucket?
What she's got.  Nine knots....
How long have you known Hoagie?
How long?
Who?
I don't remember.  One day he was just here....
Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction....
Half don't...Bring her about....
I am...You must know something about him....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
We lost it....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
I'm coming...How close is it?
I didn't ask you to....
What about Carla's gig?
I'm going down, Jake....
You getting a reading on them?
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
How come only me?
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Funny, Jake...Funny.
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
'A Moray eel....'
You don't like my voice...?
You told me what?
Holy Christ....
What the hell are you doing?
I've got to get to her....
All the time....
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.
Your equipment has crapped out again....
I'll do it, Jake.
No way....
Here it comes....
Who grows more beautiful....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
More beautiful with each passing minute...
Oh, Jake... 
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
She's in management....
You have the safety talk at school, one o'clock tomorrow....
I'll take care of it.
Did you like that, Mama?
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
The van?
Only me and Mom ..
Did you bring it with you?
What do you think?
How's the new residence?
O.K.
What does that mean?
Why so coy about the word "frozen"?
Because, don't get into it ...
There's nothing in the files?
You want my advice?
How'd you do it, old man?
Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
I haven't got it.
Then give me that Zippo.
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
What do you want it for?
That isn't what you said before.
Did he shut you down?
Did I say he did?
Why's she blind, Bro?
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
Well .. I didn't know that ..
That's a very stupid question, Ross.
Ease off, John ..
What about Citrine?
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
What exactly you doing, John?
Listen, you don't havta come?
Where's your watch?
I guess by the bed.
Bits.
What if we need a back up?
Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down.
How do you know her hair's black?
I got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut ..
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John.
Three or four.
I'm talking, outside the girl?
And did they?
I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
Did you find the knife, Sergeant?
Kid told me he didn't take it?
What are you looking for?
Vehicle references.
<u>You</u> put it in there.
The elevator wasn't working?
Can I see your hands?
Did Amber have a dog?
Yes.
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
What are you reading?
Hamlet. Have you read it?
Are you wearing a uniform?
No.
Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
Do you pray?
Have you known her long?
I know what you're like ..
How d'you know what I'm like?
Ross told me.
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
Just your age.
Which is what?
You're looking worried again, Helena?
You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
Why can't I stay with you?
It's not possible right now.
I'm going back to the institute.
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
Why does he want to kill me?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
I can't identify him ..
He don't know that. I didn't.
He doesn't need my help.
You do?
You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
I think they're gonna arrest me.
What are you doing, Travis?
You got a warrant for this?
Yes, Sir.
Who sought the warrant?
You find something curious in that?
When did John divorce?
Two or three years ago.
You think John would like it?
How you doing on those shoes?
Is that Margie?
So tonight she confesses?
No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
Except for the hair color, she looks just like Suzanne?
You want something, darling?
She married some English prick.
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
You can drive down there, Sir ..
Don't annoy me, Travis.
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
Don't ever stop fucking me!
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
Who told you?
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
Okay, this is working.
Now.
I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
This can't be happening to me.
Could you just stop moving?
I have to finish my job --
Jerry.  You and I are salespeople. We sell --
Listen to me!
No.
Didn't hear it.
There is something missing here.
No one has ever dumped me.
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
He's asleep, right?
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?
I see what you're saying.
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
Reporters, Jerry.  They been callin' all night.
... this is... uh... too funny...
Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
No no...
Hmm.  Pretty good.
Well, thanks.
Well, take care.
Oh no.
You think so?
That took guts.
No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?
We are?
Well, I'm happy for you.
Thanks.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Hey you.
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
Beer okay?
Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab.
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
We will be fine!
-- especially one like this.
Truth?
Me too.
Don't worry about it, boss.
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
Yeah, I did.
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
Well, good evening.
Happy. He said "happy?"
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
Well -- this would be goodnight.
Oh God.
Another time, okay Dorothy?
Fine, I just --
Sure you're okay to drive this?
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
If I said that, would you stay?
I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.
And I really don't know your noises yet.
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
Why do you love me?
It's my fault.
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
I don't need you to "stick."
You want...
I don't know --
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
So this break... is a break-up.
What about medical?
You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
Wait. Where is he?
He's coming over.
Good.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
Denver is where he should be.
Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
Call me tomorrow.
You love me now, don't you?
Great word.  Towel?
You're telling me to dance.
What's wrong.
Forget it.  Forget it.
If you get injured, you get nothing.
I'll get you some quick work --
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
No, I don't know.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
You don't want to go home, do you?
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
I'm asking you a question --
That's an answer.
Fine.
We still having dinner in L.A.?
Jerry!  You made it --
Thanks for coming.
I have to ask.
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
How sad --
Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
You gonna get that --
Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
Marcee --
I'm sorry what I said back there.
He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
You okay?
I'm fine.  What's up?
Pardon me?
Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
... dick?
One-two-three, swing.
No.
They do, my brother.
Let's go the zoo.
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
You said "fuck".
I don't see any.
Show me the animal, Jerry!
I'm scared.  What is it?
Can you be quiet?
Eric!
This is how you make dinosaurs?
Oh, my God.
What is it?
He says it's a bad idea!
Sorry.
You hate to swim.
You look good.
Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
No, Dr. Grant says...
Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.
Oh, don't worry about that.
What?
Nothing.
What did you say?
Nothing.
What did you say!
That's him. Thats Eric!
Eric! Are you here?
Udesky.
It's not safe.
I don't know. I don't have it with me.
When did you have it last?
I don't remember
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
We should try fishing again.
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
You had the phone the whole time?
PAUL!
Where's Dad?
We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.
I dont know.
I thought you were an expert.
Eric!
How was your trip? Profitable?
We'll be broke in four weeks.
Absolutely not.
They're here.
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
Is it a rex?
How would you classify it?
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
They never got that big.
Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
We could co-write a paper.
ALAN!
I CAN GET HIM!
NO!
He used to know me.
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
Raptors, mostly.
You remember the sounds they made?
You think they could talk to each other?
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
A well-accepted theory.
Eric, your parents are both here.
In Costa Rica?
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
Did you read Malcolm's book?
Yeah.
We need to head for the coast.
Are you sure?
Do you have any kids?
Bonitas.
You should.
We're safe!
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
I have never been on this island!
Amanda!
You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.
Just a little bit too much, I think.
It matches the pictures.
You hear something?
Any damage?
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
It doesn't matter what I think.
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
Oh --
Do you have chromium tapes?  The others fog in high-
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
Are you looking for a problem?
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
Hi, Dad.
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
My vacation is over in a week.
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
Is that kid still bothering you?
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
Well, is he?
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
"InGen."  What's InGen?
Dad!
Cancel that, Dieter.
Okay.
Where do you think you're going?!
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
What in Christ's name is going on?!
What is?
What is that?
Where's the power and radio setup?
We took to the rock.
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
What's he got in there?
Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
Their what?
She's gutty.
No way.
Do you see any family resemblance here?
Then this is our chance.
What do they want?!
No.
Lava?
No.
What are they?
Come on!
Where's Kelly?
We can't stay in here!
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
Head for the roof!
I have to find Kelly!
I think she's with Sarah!
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
Why did you come here?
Why should they?
It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
How many rounds did you find for that weapon?
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
Funded by whom?
Oh, God.
Ian.  It's guano.
What?
These formations.  They're dried --
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
Hold it down, Nick!
WHAT ARE YOU-
Where's Kelly?
Ask her.
You're sure we have to?
Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.
So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
Phones are out too.
How many lines of code are there?
But would we get the phones back?
How long will this take?
Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
These are dilated.  Take a look.
They are?  I'll be damned.
Are you sure?
I have samples all over the kitchen. 
There you are.  Out you come.
Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the grating.
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
The what?
The Cretaceous.
Anything else, you old fossil?
Okay, who's the jerk?
And what are those?
Why would they care what we think?
The movement!
So what are you thinking?
Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
Oh, shit.
Constantly sick.
Not just every six weeks.
Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
- - barfs them up - -
It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
Ellie, com one!!
Dr. Grant!
Alan?!
I'm going with you.
Okay, I'm on channel two.
It's all right.
That's right.  Will break through.
I get ah - -
I know, it's very exciting.
And scary.
It's anti-nature.
Dino droppings?
Can we chance moving him?
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.
Yes?
Hola, Juanito
I can't see.
What are we looking for?
Up and down, up and down!
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
In a box under my seat.
Are they heavy?
John, we - - what I'm just saying....
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
I read your book.
Listen, ahh - -
Tim.  Which car were you planning on - -
Tim, are you okay?
I threw up.
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
So am I going to help you with your foot?
That's a good idea.
I doubt it.
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
You got me.
Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.
You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.
Go, go, go, jump!
So you two dig up dinosaurs?
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
Machines hate you?
Yeah, they hate me.
I didn't say I was scared.
I didn't say you were scared.
I know.
Where does he think he's going?
You're sure?!
We gotta do something.
What?  What can we do?
Hey, we were saving that!
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
Can't you stop these things?!
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
Ah - - they're here.
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
Tim!  Lex!
He left us!  He left us!
It's safe?
It's safe.
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
Tim, Tim, Tim....
I'll stay awake.
All night?
I like cows.
Watch how it eats!
C'mon Tim, move down, damn it!
Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.
John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
John, John.
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
We miss you.
Thanks for the presents.
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -
Why did you do this?
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?
I hate trees!
They don't bother me.
No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop!  Stop! Stop!  Don't let the monsters come over here!
They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.
That's not funny.
Jump, Timmy!  It's too late!
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!
Fifty.
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
Mister Biller?
Yeah?
I think we're lost.
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
I really think we should go back...
Who is this? What's going on?
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
I don't know...
What about that other guy?
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
He... he's here...
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
It's still on.
What?
What happened?
_Krueger_...
Who?
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
Well?
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
Cute waitresses?
There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
See this?
That doesn't make sense.
Add it to the list.
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
And if he's not?
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
How long will the effect last?
About ten minutes.
You work in the insurance department?
Where do you live?
My assistants, I presume.
You look like brothers.
Yes -- we do.
Have you worked here long?
Fine -- terrible.
Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?
Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
Yours is a very powerful and important firm -- it has a lot at stake.
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
I don't know what you could have read.
Just what you've published.
-- In magazines nobody reads.
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
You work in the cemetery.
A man must eat --  And drink.
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
-- You appreciate my writing.
What an extraordinary request!
It's my last and final one.
Then its authority is in doubt.
A true friend would do it.
I gave it to him yesterday.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
No, I left it in his office.
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
You're just doing your job.
It's what I'm paid to do.
You're detestable.
You wanted to see me, sir.
I understand you fancy yourself an author.
The <u>Orlac</u> claim.
I know.
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
Why would you suppose so?
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
Hello again.
I've never seen you here before.
How long were you and Eduard --
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
Are you free tonight?
You almost married recently, didn't you?
Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
Eduard wanted to marry me.
-- I don't know the Musil district.
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
Why were you given notice?
You don't believe that.
I've heard of it happening.
Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
Your office is the Workmen's --
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
Where you've been employed for seven years.
I don't know.
No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
Can I ask -- how you found me?
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
He wasn't a lonely man, though.
What makes you think so?
Maybe it's true then what she said.
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
-- Just doing our job.
That's <u>mad</u>.
May I ask where your two warders are?
Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
Ludwig.
It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous.
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
Oskar!
This is filed incorrectly!
They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
Then that's the place for us!
Amerika for us!
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
Get the hell out of here.''!
Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ... · organize an expedition -
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
He's grubbing for money, father.
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
I'm sorry ...
I want to thank you.
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
It's the same image - Kong!
Jack!
Barricade the gates! Quick!
There's no island there. We're wasting our time!
They' re dead.
What was it, Jack?
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
That's your monkey, Denham.
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
It must have been terrifying?
Yeah.
Why?
What's that?
Compassion.
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
What about him? Yes.
Why? She's a junkie.
I'd just be guessing.
Don't belong?
Well I have to close up now.
Look -- could I use your phone?
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
Well we're pretty --
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
I guess he figured it was better.
What was better? I made better bait?
Yes -- all right --
-- We can talk --
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
I said yes, I see.
What about?
My name's John Klute.
Will you let me ask you some questions?
You remind me of my uncle.
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
How would I remember?
I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
What? This?
You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
What do you think?
He never told me.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?
Is there anything more I could --
I don't see anything, do you?
What're you gonna do next?
And I don't think that was Tom.
You said it was!
Yeah, you got to me.
Oh, don't be a doo-doo.
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
-- Then you don't need me.
How?
How can you do it to yourself?
I don't get you.
Ligourin: How could you do it?
Please.
Is that all you have to say?
You and I -- a relationship.
I was wondering what that was.
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Right back at the start, right?
I called Trina.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
How do you know how bad it was?
Mm.
You're going back?
You wanted to, or you are?
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
Then, close the case.
I better keep looking.
Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
Someone's been doing all these things.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
Just send me a money order.
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
All right.
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
Town Police.
Then how are you involved?
I know Tom Grunemann.
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
We grew up together. Kids.
He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.
Well?
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
Are you closing the case?
Mr. Kramer?
He's in his room, playing.
Does that distress you?
Not particularly.
The prospect of losing my child.
No.  But I've been to Brooklyn.
What about your mommy?
Oh, sure.  Here, this can be mommy.
Lunch in a restaurant.
In real life when does he hit you?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Ladies and gentlemen...
Greatest...
On earth.
When is mommy coming back?
What about my orange juice?
When is mommy coming back?
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
Uh, huh...
Okay...Same as usual...
Mom, I mean dad?
Sure.  Too much birthday cake, right?
Mom, I mean dad...
C'mon, there's not much difference--
Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay?
Salisbury steak.
No I didn't.  I hate the brown stuff.  It's gross.
All it is is onions and gravy.
I'm allergic to onions.
I think I'm going to throw up.
There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
Then eat around it.
You're no bargain either, pal.
I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...
Daddy?
Yeah?
Daddy?
Is mom ever coming back?
I don't think so.
Good night.
Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Yes?
Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite...
Objection.  You're leading the witness.
Objection.
See.  That's my name.
Wow!
Yep.
Is that really your chair?
Did mommy ever see this?
No, she never did.
Are you going to get remarried?
I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
No, son.  Daddy and mommy will never get remarried.
Mom--I mean, dad?
What did you do when you were little?
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Was there apple juice when you were little?
Yeah, there was apple juice.
I don't understand, daddy.
What don't you understand, pal?
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
Who will read me my stories?
Objection!
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
No, I did not.
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
And what is your present salary?
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
Yes.  Very much.
Objection, your honor.  The answer is, to be generous, very vague.
So do I.
Eight, almost nine years.
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
No.
A heavy drinker?
No.
Was he unfaithful?
I don't recall.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
Is that...permanent?
Yes.
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
Were you?
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning.  They'll be ready on Saturday.
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
What about Billy?
Where are you going?
Hello, Ted.  You look well.
How's the new job?
I've seen him.
He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
Okay, I'm here.  Now why did you--
Ted, do you love him?
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
Only can I still see him?
Hey, what's the rush?  C'mon, walk me a couple of blocks.
Yes.
Yes, what?
Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
And?
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
I lost him?  I lost him?
What if I fight it?
We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.
I'll take my chances.
It's going to cost.
Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer?
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
Ted?  Are you there?
Yeah.
Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.
She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights.
How many?
No.
OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
Things? What kind of things?
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
Got it.
You're on your own, understand?
I understand.
You're sure?
How many onions does it say to use?
She ever ask about me?
Thelma, if I die--
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
You heard anything yet?
Ted.
Ted, I just heard...
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
We must go, Holiness.
Please, come, Holiness.
All quiet?
Where are you from?
Mama, my story.
Again?
I am sorry, Lhamo.
Not the way to talk to people.
No.
But, I am in charge.
I do, now.
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
Will you buy the sheep for me?
Where will you keep them?
Here. We'll collect them.
I will buy them for you.
Can I free the prisoners?
Goodbye, Kundun.
Are you, General?
How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
Dalai Lama.
General Chiang.
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
I have.
He has been imprisoned, here in the Potala, Holiness.
The Sera monks have surrendered?
Did you receive the letter?
With much bloodshed.
Yes.
Holiness?
Oh, no. Where will he go?
This many?
Who am I?
You could buy them.
Do I have money?
What do you think?
I am him.
How big is Tibet's army?
Roughly five thousand men.
Is that big?
Will we be in this war?
No. This war is almost over.
In the Pacific Ocean.
It is an island. American territory.
Where is Alsace?
What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
Tell me.
Ask whatever you will.
Britain chooses not to.
Where is that?
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
I am scared.
Did you ever doubt it?
They will take Lhasa next.
Good day.
Good day.
Please, come in, so cold.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
Do you think I must?
Is that a true story, or pretend?
What do you think?
True.
What does the butter spot feel like?
I have more men.
Pretend.
I want to go down there.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
We have enemies.
The Chinese.
This is Britain.
Ahh.
The people want you made Dalai Lama.
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
You will not come?
No, Holiness.
We have.
How could I ever leave?
It is possible, Holiness.
You are unharmed?
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
It is a difficult situation.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
No.
Too young?
You killed him.
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--
I'll sue you.
You're a beautiful woman.
It seems like we're getting lower.
It happens when I land.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
Go!!!
--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
And you like me.
Jesus Christ!!
What the hell are you doing?!!
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
You're crawling around like a--
I'm laying a spring trap!
I coulda shot you, you--
They don't really attack underwater and--
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
Was he a good man?
Asia?  How... how could he get here?
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
What's that?
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
I can arrest you!!
Where is he?!
He never said "go".
This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.
Bastard bit my chopper.
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
And again.  How would you get him on land?
The more he thrashes, the better.
You ready on shore?
I got something on the screen.
Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
Where is he?
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
You take care.
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
He was an Indo-pacific.
<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
Nothing's real.
Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
No.
What?
You're gonna be okay.
Guess I finally got bit.
He's gonna live?
Kelly Scott.
Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
Oh my God.
Same thing from Fish And Game.
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
I beg your pardon?
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
It's too dangerous for--
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
Okay.  We're up at six.
Good.
Good.  See ya soon.
You okay?  Kelly?
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
<u>Are</u> you okay?
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
I didn't say it like that.
Like little children.  You okay?
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
Sorry.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
No thanks.
Thanks for the... bandaid.
Ssssh!
What?
Thing we can lift it?
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
I'm not mushing it.
You're mushing it a little around the--
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
Calm down.
You calm down!
What?
We might as well pack.
Are we crazy?
He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?
He's floating.  Take it home.
He's mooing.
Watch out!!
Hector!!
He's through fighting.  Look at him.
Get him onto shore.
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... 
It was... something meeting you.
Half mile up, there's a clearing.
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
What's that?
White perch.
Are they feeding?
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
You said nobody came in here!
If you get a safe shot...
I'll take it!
Thanks for your help.
He just came up screaming.
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
I wouldn't.
Well.  At wakes.
This is a little different.
You talk to the married couple?
You have a thing against museums?
I got nothing against--
You're sort of a rude person.
Was he swallowed?
What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
What?
I thought I saw...
Hey!!
You threw it at me!!
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
You like Jack?
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
Hector thinks you like him.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
You think Jack's handsome?
Hank?
Hank!
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Did you get him?
Should I?
Kelly.
That's not what you came to say.
The somebody else part?
It's ten after nine.
This is what we do?
Part of our research--
I'm not even a field person.
Backstabber?
No.
Liar?
Myra.
Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?
Never cock. Just squeeze.
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?
Boy, is that smart...
No. He won't come after me.
Well, except for the one girl.
'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
"- every day."
Agent Starling! Telephone!
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
You're all right! Where is he?
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
Okay, Miss Starling?
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
That wasn't me.
Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
Who's the subject?
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
Miggs has been murdered.
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
I am, yes.
That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
It's much better than your shoes.
Maybe they'll catch up.
I have no doubt of it.
All that detail, just from memory...?
No, I came because we need -
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
I didn't.
You're a tough one, aren't you?
Your bleeding has stopped.
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
Ahhh... Why?
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
Yes.
Big through the hips. Roomy.
They all were.
Was it a butterfly?
The death of my father.
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
Horses - and sheep...
How long did you live there?
Two months.
Why so briefly?
I - ran away...
No.
Did he try to?
I heard a strange sound...
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
Yes...! They were screaming.
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
Thank you, Clarice.
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
What...?
Time, Pilch! My move.
Of course it counts. How do you play?
My God, you've grown up.
We leave in the morning?!
Can we rest soon?
You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
The Ottawa are gone.
"We're a breed apart and we make no sense"...?
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
Because what I am interested in is right here...
Are we safe?
And my compliments to you...
Will you go back to England?
When? How?
There was none!
What?
There was no letter.
You still have an aversion to the water?
"Some"?
Will you consider that?
My God, Alice.
One called Magua arrived.
I see...
Yes. Go ahead.
... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
We were headed...
Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
What?!
Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
No.
Fort Edward, then?
No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!
Ottawa!
That is sedition! Treason!
Where do we go from here?
We don't.
Any powder?
What did you say?
I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
And what is that?
Webb's at Edward?
Sir!
Advance, Sergeant Major!
Shoulder arms!  Present! 
Sergeant Major!
Excuse me. What did you say?
Gifts?
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
Wampum?
Gold could be arranged.
For Munro children?
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
What is enough?
The honors of war?
Granted.
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
Qui vive?
France.
Le mot d'ordre?
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
Here.  Put this on.  You examine him.
I'm not a doctor.
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
Doc eat already?
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
It's got Hazy!
I thought they were your friends?
Jesus Christ...
Can you fix it?
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
Go on!
No!
That's an order!
Where the hell've you been?
Your suit, Becky!
How do you know it was Williams?
You did good...
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
I need more light on that, Four.
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
No.  I'm just being friendly.
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
Shit!  He sent them all.
What are you doing?
We're on backup air.
How much time does that give us?
We made it!
It hit me!  Where are they?!
The internal monitors read normal.
Where's Doc?!
What's wrong with it?
Excuse me, sir...
I'm going inside.
What's your air reading?
Twenty minutes...
Give me a readout, DeJesus.
How do you feel, DeJesus?
Made your million, yet?
Not yet.
You got money in this tub?
Yes sir...
What the?...
Bullshit.
What happened?
It...almost got you.
Still bothering you?
So that's all you do?...
Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music.
Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
Hey!...I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!
It's Sixpack!
Typhoon?!
Getting some food.
How far away is she?
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
What are you going to do to him?
I'm going to try to remove it.
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
It would explain the suction- like appendages.
Clear for pickup.
Who were you talking to?
Sixpack...
What on earth's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...
What is it?
What is it?
Don't spend all day down there.
Are you okay, Jonesy?
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
Hardly.
How much did you part with?
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
A what?
Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.
Well?
You want a pint, go to the pub.
I thought this was a pub.
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
Like what?
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
I don't know what you mean.
They were . . .
You fucking well have to get 'em!
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
I hate these Southern shites.
Nope.
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
Have you counted the money?
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
Son, have a look in his locker.
I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
You all right back there, mate?
Is he on his own?
Just carrying a bag.
It's not him, Dad.
All right, Dad.
Is that you, Dean?
Sure is.
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
Who was that?
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
Dog, I have found the cash!
There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
It must be this one.
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
Yeah, one of them's out.
My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?
And all your friends, there's a good lad.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
Where?
Out the back.
And the weed?
Invitations.
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward.
That's it all done, we are off.
There's nothing in it!
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
What the hell are you doing here?
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
Everything all right out there, Tom?
You and me, Tom.
Tom, this is our case.
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.
Tom?
You got it all?
Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.
That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.
I will.
You will what?
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
That's if I want to see you.
I'll see ya.
For half a million?
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
Go on.
I like your bar.
Yes?
I want your bar.
Hello, can I help you?
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
I can't help you, Plank.
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
How much did you say it was, Tom?
You know how much it is, Nick.
And that does include the amp?
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
I'll only be a minute.
Look. Go on, look.
At what, exactly?
My van is half full.
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
You would take a pain ín the arse full stop.
How many feet?
What are you carrying, Willy?
Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
I don't know what the big deal is.
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
I can't take any more school.
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
That makes it okay?
It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
I-I can do the job, sir.
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
Who's "they"?
Do whatever they tell you--
I do, sir.
Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"?
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
Why don't you start with that?
You're dismissed, Private.
So you knew this young man before?
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
You're dismissed.
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
And you and Private Graves--
Private Johnson!
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
I hear they're closing that post down.
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
Yeah, this is Skinny.
Charley Wade.
You know the popular version of how he left town.
Everybody on the border knows that story.
Colt Peacemaker.
A .45--
He swore by it.  What?
It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?
Whole different story; isn't it?
Do I seem jumpy?
Same weight I always was.
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
350 pounds.
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
Hey, it's the General.
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
Come on in--
If it's too late--
Where'd he get all this?
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
My mother said he never asked about--
No sir.
Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse.
They fought against the Indians?
Same as they done in Mexico.
But they were Indians themselves.
They were in the Army. Like your father.
You know who I am?
That guy who got shot--
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
Didn't have a father?
Dad--?
You wouldn't?
My father.
You lived in the States for a while?
Fifteen years in El Paso.
Made some money, came back here--
This place is a gold mine.
What?
It's a lead mine.
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
You going to get married?
It's a .45.
Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
Seriously, I think we should get married.
We been through this before--
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
That ring--
Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
That where he was shot?
That's where he fell.
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
I gonna meet that family of yours?
Why would you want to do that?
Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]
Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
Reputation?
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]
Vi a Rosaria arastrado para el corriente--[I saw Rosaria taken away by the current--]
Como se llama? [What's your name?]
Is very beautiful, your car.
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
Senora Cruz?
What are you doing out there? Are you crazy?
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
I have some friends who have had a accident--
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?
This girl is a friend of yours?
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
We have a daughter.
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
Tell that one, Hollis--
"Mas cerveza por favor."
Your mother was a saint.
That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.
We don't need a new jail.
Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--
I heard there was a bit of a fuss.
I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
I haven't been out here for a while.
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
You thought any more about our murder?
We have a murder?
I got an idea what happened.
Fellas.
Hey, Sam.
Buddy Deeds--
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
The Perdido thing?
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
Steve called for you.
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
How 'bout the Sheriff?
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
If you spent a little more time training them--
He was killed.
Right. When he was killed.
A little older than Paloma is now.
There must have been somebody.
I was too busy.
Thank you.
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
I never said that. It was just that boy--
Mrs. Bledsoe?
That's me.
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
You ever play one of these?
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
He had the club out on the old trail road--
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
Not if I can help it.
Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
Okay? He's not here?
No. Is he sick?
I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.
That was the night he disappeared?
Could of been. That was white people's business.
What about it?
Of course you can.
Mom?
Yeah?
You gonna stay out here?
What's she singing about?
She finally got in--
It's Saturday.
You got in late last night.
Can I get this?
Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
Morning, Sheriff.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
Time marches on.
How much you got left?
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
That's how I ruined my stomach.
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
Something wrong?
They've got my Amado.
Got him here?
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
Your mother still doesn't like me.
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
I thought you got through that pretty well.
People liked him.
Yeah.
Your boy, there--
Amado.
Nice-looking kid.
He hates me.
You've got your mother, your kids--
I should get back.
Wow.
How come it feels the same?
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
How long have you lived here?
Like your story is over.
Pilar--
Yeah?
What was your father's name?
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
We start from scratch--
You're out early.
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
They got telephones.
Gotta be in person.
Yeah.
You'd do a good job.
How 'bout you?
Don't know if I'll still want it.
I didn't want to be going around your back.
Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed.
That the problem, son?  You Slow?
You telling me what to do, Roderick?
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
I haven't seen anybody come by.
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
Hell of a spot to put a business.
No--
I know you?
Name's Otis.
Payne.
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
I know that.
How come you don't took familiar?
You going to tell her?
You going to tell him?
He doesn't need to know all my business.
He's gonna find out.
How much?
Hello, L.A.
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
Who?
Nix.
Nix?
Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
How?
You heard right.
My life was too weird for her.
That's Butterfield...
Take a look at this.
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
Hokey enough for you?
How'd you spell that again?
D'Amour.
Right.
Right.
You did.  Didn't you?
Why would I do that?
Who did this?
Who did this?
D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?
About?
Death.
What about death?
Please.
I could scoop them out.
So tell me where Nix is buried.
Anything?
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
What is he?
Yes...
He's with us...
And are you afraid?
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
Harry.
Harry.
He's good.
I don't know where you'd start.
They were jealous of him.
Why?  Because he had you?
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
So why did you marry him?
Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
Okay.  I'll keep digging.
It was more than that, I think.
He was the real thing, right?
He taught all this to Swann?
I wasn't.
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
Nothing?
Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
Are you sure?
I'm sure.  He's dead.
And they all came...
Yes.
What was that?
Are you all right?
Oh God!
I've got to help him.
... oh... God...
...yes?
Don't look.
Harry?
Is it finished?
What the fuck?
Valentin?
Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.
It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.
... they believe you.
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
Sure.
Somebody killed him.
Oh God.
And this Butterfield guy--
--vanished.
They weren't worth a damn.
I heard he was the best.
Oh, I've got plenty.
I'm not saying another word.  You damn fool.  He's a journalist.
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
With what?
Shit.
Mr. D'Amour?
Go away.
It's one in the afternoon.
Then what do you want?
I'm here to offer you a job.
I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
Whose is the car?
Maybe I just bought it.
Philip Swann?
You know of him?
I saw him in Vegas once.
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
Any movie stars buried here?
Are you sure?
Who is she?
What the fuck are you doing here?
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
Yes.  It's regrettable
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
What for?  You need to stay busy?
I like to know why things happen.
I want to speak to Dorothea.
I'm afraid she's not in.
I can't let you in.
Yeah, I know.
Leave her alone --
I tried to pay you off.
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
I want to see Swann face to face.
D'Amour --
Shit...
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
What's her problem?
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
The Puritan?
Yes...
Where'd you learn that?
What?
At birth.  I don't know you --
You know Vinovich?
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
For what?
For an introduction.
Are they all in the business?
Look, Ma, no wires.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
How the fuck do you do that?
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
Or murdered, like Nix.
I did it for Dorothea.
So Nix won't come looking for her?
Oh Jeez.
You think I'm an asshole.
No.
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
Yes.
They got here before us.
... no...
He's better off this way.
Nobody's better off this wav!
That's where we're all going.
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
This is where we killed him.
You didn't try hard enough.
Yes?
Can you do it?
I don't know.
I got to go.  I'm late.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
One question.
What?
Have we met before?
Maybe... I... don't...
What about Philip Swann?
He's not!  He's not!
Nix! Nix!
Is he the Puritan?
Yes! Yes!
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
Swann?  What are you doing?
You could still help me do that.
Why would I want to?
No!
Hello?
Bob, it's me.
Ok.
You'll do it?
How long have you been married?
Two years.
Oh.
What do you do?
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
What did you study?
Oh, what do you do with that?
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
No, how about you?
Not really. How long are you here for?
You really are having a mid-life crisis.
I don't want to go home.
Hello?
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
Really?
Did I scowl at you?
No, you smiled.
Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
Oh.
You're possessive.
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
No, yes, it does...
But, I'm mean.
That's ok.
And marriage, does that get easier?
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
I know.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
It's for my daughter.
How old is she?
Four.
Nice one.
It's bad isn't it?
You think so?
Where's your husband?
Working.
Do you ever see him?
I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.
What do you want to drink?
So, where'd you go today.
I'm sorry.
When are you leaving?
Tomorrow.
I'm going to miss you.
That's what you said the other night.
Charlotte?
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
You're leaving right now?
Yes.
Well... have a good flight.
Thanks.
Why are you crying?
Mr. Harris?
Yes?
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Oh?
Mr. Harris?
Yes?
Do you like massage?
I don't think so.
Yes?
Lydia?
Ok, well... I love you.
Hello?
Bob?
Hi, Lydia.
Is this a bad time?
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
It's just carpet.
That's not what I'm talking about.
I don't know.
What?
You know, eat healthier.
Alright?
Not all that pasta.
Fine.
Hello?
It's Lydia, your wife.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
Fine. Is it going ok?
It's ok.
Do you want to- 
I guess she's busy.
That's ok.
When are you coming home?
Great.
Excuse me?
Hospital?
Hello? Yes?
Hello, can I have room 5601.
Evelyn Waugh?
What?
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
How'd it go today?
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
You wanna come?
Sure.
I don't know what to do.
You smell weird.
Like popcorn?
Do you think it's done?
Its bad for you.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
Oh, the record company sent these...
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
Are you sure you want to stay?
I miss you.
John! What are you doing here?
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
You never said anything to me...
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Uh...sure...I...what?
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
What?  That's horrible!
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
I'm still shaking.
I can't believe Will killed him.
I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.
Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
I don't know.  What are they?
I found them in your file box.
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
What a...jerk!
Nonsense, it's all of our home.  So how's work treating you?
...you wearing a watch, Father?
What time did you make it for?
And how would you describe him?
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
Is he going to be okay?
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
What is it?
Something he said, just before...
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
So...we won?
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
Father, please don't die.
You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
Well I know he's come here before.
Peter...Peter Kelson.
You just call?
Two negatives always make a positive.
May I help you?
Peter Kelson?
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
And also that...
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
A narcissist doesn't admit it.  It's the extreme of self-denial.
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
So...what did you think of the tape.
I think you gave me the wrong one.
So what'd I miss?
We need to talk.
What are you looking for exactly?
We needed to know all we could.
Get up!!
You okay?
When's your birthday?
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?
There's nothing else here.
What's the bible for?
I'm scared I'm slipping back.
We're going to do this.
Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?
No oxygen to the brain.
Plenty of time.
He was trying to tell me something.
How much time do we have?
Good seeing you again.
Hello?
I know who he is.
Maya?  What do you mean?
And what are you thinking we should do now?
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
A lot of good that'll do.
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
You don't want to face it.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
You know what?  You can go.
Get out of here.
Mr. Kelson, here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
He can see you Thursday.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
Lemme guess.  The lottery.
Yeah.
Good of you to stop by.
Would you sign it for me?
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
What's the matter with you?
He could see me.
How're you doin' today?
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession.
Parents died?
Yeah, murder-suicide.
Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
Monica, what did you do?
Nothing.
Taste this.
You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
Monica.  What are you doing here?
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Dad around?
Hi.
Need any help?
Engaged.
To that stewardess?
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
Don't curse.
I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
Which one for tomorrow?
The blue.
Okay.
He's fine.
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
Can I take your coat?
Sort of.
Huh?
My mouth is kinda dry.
That was nice.
Wait...
Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA.
Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.
You could make a career by telling me where.
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
It means a lot that you came by.
I don't wanna see that.
So how long is this trip?
That too tight?
No.
Mom's going to hate it.
Always on my ass, anyway.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
No one's forcing her.
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
I found you someone.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
No.
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
This brother from my college.
He's in college?
And he's fine, girl.
Oh, great.
You do.
You ever been in love?
Too many times.
They ever love you back?
Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.
You lost your head.
I know.  But chances are...
Hey, munchkin.
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
You shoot like a girl.
I was just playing ball.
You were trying to make me look bad.
What's up?
Well, what do you know.
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
Can you take that damn thing off the table.
So what are these Spanish guys like?
One, up.
For real?
So how come you could play basketball?
Your Dad play?
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
You do act different.
I don't like flowers.
Kay.
I think we gotta kiss now.
For how long?
I want to ride my own bike.
I don't have to do what you say.
Way to hoop.
A ride home.
Your legs don't look broke.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
That's it, give it your best shot.
With a jacked-up attitude.
Didn't know you cared so much.
I don't.
See you made it.
Yeah.
You don't look half-bad.
Hey.
Hey.
You having fun?
He ain't Spalding.
Guess not.
Mulholland Drive.
Four.
What was that about?
Yeah.
You do see me standing here, right?
It's okay, little baby.
So how about a little one-on-one?
What are we playing for?
Clothes.
Give me the ball.
Kiss my booty.
Yo, where's the "D"?
I won.
I...can't.
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
Nah.  Don't sweat it.
Hey.
Sorry about your game.
Who was that?
Nobody.
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
You want to go talk?
Hey.
The "man" again.
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.
What the hell's going on?
We're going to get some food.
Can we talk?
Cheap date.
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
Least you got your priorities straight.
I never asked you to choose.
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
I don't think so.
You don't think so?
Look, I'm entering the draft.
When did you decide all this?
Few days ago.
So that's it, just forget about us?
Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.
Just something I'm trying.
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
Yup.
Not for Quincy McCall.
So, how's pro-ball, Europe?
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
Funny.  I never did.
Tried calling you a couple times.
Actually, I don't...
Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
It just isn't.
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
Like what?
So why'd you give up ball?
Why do you keep asking me that?
Cause I don't get it.
Something was just missing.
What's going on?
you woke me up to tell me that?
Better late than never, right?
I'll play you.
One game.  One-on-one.
You're out of your mind.
So you're gonna bitch up?
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
There's so many I just can't keep track.
Give it yourself.
With who?
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
Not great.
What's that, not great?
Nona, please.
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
What?
We still have to go?
What is this?
You hearing me?
How was your game?
Still the man.
Where's your dad?
Said he'd be home later.
You scared me.
Sorry.  You okay?
Just...leave it alone.
Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
What people?
Tell me what?
Your door was unlocked.
We need to talk.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
And some things should never fucking happen!
What do you want?
Came by to check on you.
No.
Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
What surery?
You smell like trouble --
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
You ok?
Hey, Janet, it's Chad.
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
Well can you connect me to someone else?
Uh-huh.
Does this sound weird?
What kind of Cancer?
Brain and Lung.
My mother had breast cancer.
Oh, she's fine.
Oh that's good.
It was scary though.
It's a helluva disease.
...what the fuck is this...?
What the fuck do you want?
Don't yell, honey.  Please don't go crazy --
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.

Honey.

OPEN THE DOOR.

No.
You don't have a boyfriend?
No.

About two years ago.
You and your boyfriend have a party last night?

I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
Yeah.
Is this boyfriend bothering you?
I don't have a boyfriend.
Just Jim.

Bye, bye, Claudia.
I'm sorry, Claudia.
Please, yes.
Well...is that illegal?
Really?

Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
It's my favorite place --
Great, bye.
So you've done it --
Wow....huh..."...piss and shit..."
What?
You really use strong language.
I'm sorry --
It's fine.
I'm sorry.

I lost my gun.
It's ok.
Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.

Wanna kiss me, Jim?

I should maybe go to the bathroom.
I don't know.
What happend, what's going on?
Let's go, c'mon, get up --
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
DADDY! DAD! DAD WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON?
C'mon, Dad.  We gotta just GET HIS MONEY AND GO, LET'S GO. Let's get the money --
We're not gonna do that now.  We're not gonna do that now and that's over.

Put the gun down, please, boy.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
Son, please, now....
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
How much you pay me for my help?
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
Why the hell aren't you in school?
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
Ok. Listen. You: c'mere.
Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
Have you ever been to Juvenille Hall?
I ain't fuckin with you --
Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it.
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
I'm almost done.
Now that shit will help you SOLVE the case.
Did you listen to me?
Doc it's Janet.
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet.
Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
You look like you've got money in your pocket.
This sounds threatening.
Is it real love?
A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
....do you know who I am?
You're a friend of the family I presume?
What?
"The" cause of dullness in others --
This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
I confuse melancholy and depression sometimes....
Mmm.Hmm.
I'm sick.
Stay that way.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
You mind your own bussines.
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
...please...
What is that?
Braces.
Braces?
Yes.
You don't need braces.
Yes I do.
I've been a good worker --
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
Give me your keys, Don.
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!
He has Phil right now.
I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
Do you wanna sit down?
How's today then?
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.

Get a girlfriend.
She loves you.

Hello?
Hi.  Is Frank there?
I think you have the wrong number.
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
No.
Alright.  Thank you.
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
-- let's talk more about your background --
I'm confused about your past is the thing.
Is that still lingering?
-- just to clarify --
Are you asking me that?
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
It's all important --
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
Mm. Hm.
C'mon, Frank.  What are you doing?
What am I doing?
Yeah.
Time's up.  Thank you for the interview.
Where are you from originally?
Around here.

Hollywood, mainly.
Why does that sound silly?
Well I guess it doesn't.
Does you mother still work?
She's retired.
Are you close?
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
And your father?
He passed away.
I'm sorry.

I wouldn'tve asked --
Not a problem.
From '84 to '89.
Psychology major?
Right.
Do you have your masters?
...this close...
What name?  My name?
It's not your given name, right?
And "Frank?"
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
How long have you taken care of him?
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
When did he go off chemo?
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
Uh. huh.
I'm really sorry.
He's in here --?
Uh. huh.
It's interesting.
I don't think, he can't...
What? What? What now?
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
You can't just come in here.
You're just come in --
There's no disturbance.
No one else in here?
Are you lyin' to me?
No I Said.
Ok. What's your name?
I preffer to stand.
I don't know a loud crash.
You on any medication?
No.
Been drinkin' today?

No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch --
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
What the hell is this Marcie?
You look great.
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
...you know...
Did your wife find out?
No.
All your other fluzzies?
Yes.
I won't.
What happend to you?
Are you ok?
Rose is on the phone and here's the cards for today --
I need you to get me Paula --
You want her right now?
Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
I can't fuckin' do this.
I'm gonna need a full name, Stanley.
I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry.
How you doing?
I'm drinking.
Slowly or quickly?
As fast as I can.
-- did she talk to you?
She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
I love you.
Love you too..
I don't think I want that.
It'll take the pain away.
You're my handsome man.
Will that help?
How many times....it's ok...just say... Just say...
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
I'll answer anything.
Yes.
Who?
Rose, I don't --

That's it.
Just once.
How long with Paula?
Two years...three years...
It's over.  I talked to her this morning.
Do you have any children with anyone?

Well maybe.
I love you so much.
I think that you know.
...say it, Jimmy...
Did you ever touch her?
Jimmy, did you touch her?
...Jimmy...
<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
You deserve to die alone for what you've done.
I don't know what I've done.
I don't know what I've done.
Hello?
Hello.  Is Claudia here?
She's asleep.
Are you her boyfriend?
You're Jimmy Gator, right?
Yes.  What's your name?
I'm Bob.
Can I come in?
Want me to wake her up?
I'm sorry.
Was it a call back?
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
They look pretty smart, I think.
You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest.
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
Linda --
Let me call you a car, Linda.
Linda --
Hang up the phone.

Yes. What? Yes.
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
I don't have regular classes anymore.
Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley?
I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time.
Cmon,cmon,cmon, that one to?
Be ready at two --
C'mon, man.
You're late, not me.
You coulda been in front --
You ready to keep winning?
Go to it, handsome.
What's the problem, what's the problem here?
I'm fine. nothing.
Why didn't you answer those questions?
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
Stand up.
...oh Jesus, what the fuck...?
Hi.
Hi.
..sorry...
Hi.
Hi.
..sorry...
It's not right.
I have money.
I have money to give you.
What is that?
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
It's raining frogs from the sky.
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
I understand you saved my son's life today.
God smiled upon us.
And you were not hurt?
Oh God I -- Forgive me...
What -- ?
M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
My Queen...
There were two.  Not one.  But two.
May I speak with you?  Alone?
What is it, mother?
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
What had you to do with this, Mother?
How goes that favor I asked of you?
D'Artagnan, arrest them all!
What do you propose to do?
It can.  I know the way.
What are they doing?
The Prison of Belle Sur.
What is that?
Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
Who is he, Aramis?
You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.
Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is ludicrous!
Go on.
But -- what is Porthos doing?
Now.  You were saying?
But -- what is he doing?
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
He seeks redemption.
So what has changed?
Then to the Bastille.
A simple theological discussion.
I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
Pull them back, d'Artagnan.
You can't do it.
Pull them back!
Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.
Forgiveness.
I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
Aramis... is this the way to hell?
Mother of God!
It is also a place of burial.
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
Coming?
What use am I?
We go someplace dangerous.
Aramis... These are... these are whores!
So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
Who?
D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.
D'Artagnan!
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
Raoul is everything to me.
I know.
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
Athos, please...!
Get out of my way.
Where are you going?
He lies.  He is here to trap us.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?
I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.
How did you know -- ?
Whose rooms are those?
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
Phillippe...?
Are you hungry?
There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
At least help Raoul.
I will consider it.  Now leave me.
I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?
Your Majesty...?
It shall be done, your Majesty.
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
... You knew you had a double?
Where is Michelle?
... The ball... Continue.
You dead yet?
Food, moron.
What number, on the first page?
You've... memorized...?
... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
Now.  Where is d'Artagnan?
Magnificent valor...
Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
Exactly why it should be given away.
... Nothing.
Raoul... is in love...
The food doesn't please you?
Shall I leave?
Captain Doyle?
What can I do for you?
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
Cooperate?
You mind if I ride with you?
It's Marvosa -
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
Yeah?
Where are you?
We're by Ozone...
You set to go -
What do you think?
What the hell is this Marvosa!!
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
Did you hit him?
What did the six-toes have to say?
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
Find out for me.
Let's roll -
I'll take the south end -
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
Gotta come from somewhere...
Something wrong with you Marvosa?
Alright, where is she?
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
Are you alright?
I was just having a little fun -
And what did he do to the girl?
And where the hell is Marvosa?
He said he was following up some lead.
Captain?
So where are you from?
Up north.
Where up north?
Seattle.
No...
No.
What's going on here?
Why did you set me up?
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
No.  A witness.
I had it all on tape...
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
What?
Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
No...I'm in some trouble...
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
Jesus, man...
Holy shit -
And?...
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
I've got a better idea...
1490...Breckinridge...
Both at the same bank...
Ahh, shit.  We're pretty much tapped out.  I'm getting denied access all over the place...
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
I'm not going anywhere!
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
I'm stranded out here.
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
Are you a regular there?
What would your - boyfriend - think?
You don't seem afraid of much.
No.  It wasn't like that!
Where am I going?
Don't you guys ever knock?
That was Peterson upstairs.
It was you who did the asking.
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
Could he handle a direct contact?
In thirty-five minutes.
How long do I have?
That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
Where?
Read it.
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?
Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.
Somebody hurt him?
No.
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
You look all right now.
As long as they're dead...
Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
Get him to Atlanta.
You said the guy down here is good.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
See? You do know something about him.
For Christ's sake, why?
Is it weird?
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
Who did he ask for?
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
Get me a plane...
Wait, Will...
Get me a plane!
I'll pick you up in...
That's narrow?
When are you coming back?
There's no connection between the families.
He's a very shy boy...
What?
That's why the boltcutter.
It's getting late and...
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
Have him peel the top label back.
Will...?
How far away's the back-up?
I'll cover the back.
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
Wait for the back-up! Will?
Where the hell's Graham!
He went to the men's room.
...twenty-eight minutes.  Cryptography at Langley?
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
What's being photographed?
The activities of nocturnal animals.
When do you need it?
Tonic will be fine.
Is that you. D?
Yes, are you okay...?!
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
Reba...
Francis? Where are you?
The developing room.  I need to... see you.
No. Reba...?
Are you okay...?
You'll come by?
It's me.
Who?
Me.
Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?!
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
What am I doing here?
Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
Yes.
Do you feel privileged?
I'm very scared.
Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.
Do you see?
Do you see?
Oh, God.
Do you see?
Please, no.
'No' what?
Not me.
Are you a man?
God, no.
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
You'll let me go now?
You will tell the truth?
Come in.
Dr. Chilton.
Do you have it?
I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
I want to see Lecktor now.
Linda King's desk.
Hi, Linda. ..
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
No. I can help you.
I don't understand.
Do you know something about that?
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
I don't think I'll tell you.
He's right-handed.
Most people are.
He's misunderstood.
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
To yourself...
I call him a monster.
I understand he cut you pretty good...
What did he want?
He asked how you are.
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
What the hell can I do?
Molly?
Hello, hotshot!
Hey, baby! Where are you?
At the store. You doin' some good?
Me, too. And very erotic...
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
To do what?
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
Blue, then.
I remember.
Do you remember what you said?
Can I have one of your cigarettes?
You haven't smoked in two years.
No.
Can you quit?
No.
What will you do?
I have to go back to Birmingham.
Mama was probably asleep.
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
Let's forget who said what to whom...
Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
You going back down to Florida after?
What's that?
Meet point's up ahead!
Go on to the house.
Lt. Fisk said...
What do you want?
Are you George Sherman?
Yes. Who are you?
My name's Will Graham. I...
No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
Will it keep them out?
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
Yes.
We don't know that.
Did the girl die?
No.
She got all right?
...after a while.
And Hobbs died?
Did you get my card?
You've read the transcript. It's all there.
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
I thought you would have some ideas.
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
Then how did you catch me, Will?
You had disadvantages.
What disadvantage?
You're insane.
Yes.
Pictures?
No.
Do you dream much, Will?
What were the yards like?
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
I want your opinion.
I don't have one right now.
May I keep the file?
Kevlar Second Chance.
You got it.
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
No.
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
You have to do it.
Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.
Andy?
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
Andy!
Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
I can't move my arm.
My hair is coming out.
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
Andy!
Twenty!
Ten.
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
Hi...
Hi... am I late?
Hi...
Hi... am I late?
Popcorn?
Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.
Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
Go away.
It's me.
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
You don't know the real me.
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
How can you be so casual??!
You're NOT DYING!
I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!
You're not listening to me --
GET OFF!
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Then your father's a wimp.
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Then your father's a wimp.
I'm gonna quit.
Each show is worse than the next.
Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
Give me the book.
No!  Andy, don't do it --
I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
It's so dirty.
Sir, do you have a problem?
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
Are you at peace with your family?
Excuse me, Andy...
It is apparently not working.
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
Are you sure?
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
It's probably just a strained muscle.
Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!
Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?
Er, yes.  Speaking.
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
That was a really hot house!
I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work.
Why...?  Andy, why...?
If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.
Where?
Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy much to do.
Why is he saying these things?!
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!
What's your name?
Bob Gorsky.
"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
It's my name.
Then the informant is real.
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
He'll be contacting us again.
Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
We'll need a search running.
You don't know.
The sewers.  Of course.
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
And you are?
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
Lieutenant?
Oh shit.
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
He's gonna make it.
Weird.
That's the third white van I've seen.
What?!
Who is it?
You're two hours late.
If you get caught using that --
You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
Did you hear that?
Are you sure this line is clean?
There's something about him, isn't there?
Hello, Trinity.
Cypher?  Where's Tank?
He had an accident.
... yes.
I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!
Sorry.
No, it's all right.
What are you doing?
Is that...?
Why you're here?
Five.  Since I've been here.
What happened to them?
Dead.  All dead.
Thanks... for the drink.
Operator.
I need an exit!  Fast!
I got you.
Are they any agent?
Yes.
All right --
I got a fibrillation!
They'll be able to track it.
What is he doing?
How long?
You can't use that until Neo is out!
Who's coming for me?
Stand up and see for yourself.
Right now?
Holy fucking shit!
The cubicle across from you is empty.
Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.
It's an honor.
No.
What are you doing?
Why do my eyes hurt?
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
Right now, we're inside a computer program?
For what?
How did I beat you?
Do you know why you didn't make it?
I thought it wasn't real.
If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?
Yeah.
What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
Set down in there.
So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
The beginning?
Of the Resistance.
And she knows what?  Everything?
She would say she knows enough.
She helped you?
Yes.
What did she tell you?
And you still believe I'm the One?
How is he?
Got it.
Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
We need an exit.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
Tank, charge the E.M.P.
I'm going to make the call.
That vase.
What's funny?
Hello, Neo.
Who are you?
That was a long time ago.
Gee-zus.
I just thought... you were a guy.
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
Of what?
They're watching you, Neo.
What the hell is this?!
It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
From what?
What is this thing?
Uh-oh...
Get this thing out of me!
But an Oracle can.
Is it?
Are you worried?
Should I be?
Yes.
What did she tell you?
Are you all right?
What did you just say?
Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
Go!
We can't leave him!
What are you doing?
I'm going in after him.
You can't!
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
Why?
What are you doing?
I'm coming with you.
Neo, how did you do that?
Can you fly that thing.
Morning.  Did you sleep?
See who?
What are they doing to him?
They're hacking his mind.
Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
Why?
It's locked.
Operator.
We need an exit!
Tank, you're hurt.
I'll be all right.
There is.  We have to pull the plug.
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
Neo!
What the hell just happened?
What just happened?
They've burned through the outer shields.
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Know where he is?
Look fella...this is private...
We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.
No.
That means it's good.
No, all we got is $40.
Sssh!  Quiet.  Y'know that's illegal.
Why?
I gotta get the stuff.
Hey hold it!  Gimmie the cash.
Uh...can we give you a check?
No.
May God be with you.
'And with your spirit.'
Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?
Who's the girl?
Jewish...
Look at her.
Where to?
I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?
Nervous?
You flew before?
And say what?
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
Waddaya think?
Next time, bet with your own kind.
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
You got some mouth!
Drinks for everybody Tony...
I know but let's hear it anyway.
Nah.
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
There won't be any this week.
What do you mean?
Hey...you got nothing here.
Don't come any closer!!!
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
Let's get out of here.
That's not going to help.
Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this...
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
Don't you move!!!
Back so soon.
Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...
No...I'll be ok for a week.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Michael, give us a lift.
Hey, shut up.
Disgraceful.
Out!!!!
You getting out too?
How much?
Well, he isn't.  Nice...real nice.
$3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?
Where's the rest?
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
Uncle, how are you feeling?
Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
Take a drink!
Hey, where you been?
Oh...around...why?
Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
Well, maybe you missed something?
Wasn't a book...was a short story.
What was it?
Nothing.
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
"Francis Macomber."
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Please take it.
Well...
Sure...it's not that...I mean...
An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
Maybe, who knows.
Charlie...?
What is it now?
Did you?
Take your time.  I don't care.
That W.A.S.P. bastard.
You're intolerable today.
You know why...with my parents.
Well you can't blame them in a way.
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
The girls like it loud.
What's the matter with this kid?
Don't count it...it's all there.
Count it.
Scumbag--
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
Sal!... fourteen street.
This is some boat.  Your father's?
Hey... you got stereo.
Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.
I know...I know.
Yeah, it's your father's.
Well...no.
You mean it's heisted.
You could say that.
Just keep him quiet.
Friends of yours Michael.
How much?
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Can you spare it?
-- But he does seem very nice.
Look who's talking.
Did you speak to the Governor?
He's coming.
Daddy!  Come on, a name.
Just plain 'Joe'?
That was 'Joe'.
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
Daddy!
Hi, Allison --
Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
I know you do, darling.
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
Who?
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
What is this?
I don't like cake.
Oh, the goddam party --
Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
I haven't been the father to you that --
That you've been to Susan?
Yeah, but --
But what?
What do you do that for?
I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
Red or white?
Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
What are you eating.
Toast?  No...just the butter.
-- Did I hear 'business'?
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
Well... goodnight.
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
Thank you for coming.
Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
Here...
Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?
Why yes, thank you.
Hot or cold.
Cold.
Yes.
Yes.
What an odd pairing.
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
Of whom?
It doesn't matter.
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
A voice?
In my sleep.
What'd it say?
'Yes'.
I was saying to Quince we won't need --
Did you just hear something?
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
Sounds good.
It's going to be great --
Do you think I need a haircut?
Like a marriage made in heaven?
Yeah, something he goes by --
'Joe...'
Is there any more to it?
What do you mean?
Have we met?
...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
I am now.
No.
'Just kidding'?
Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.
Mind if I throw up?
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
Whose?
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
And what do I get?
Yeah.
'It's up to Joe', huh?
He was interested.
'It's up to Joe'?
I'm going to put a stop to this!
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
Obeah.
Obeah evil.  I not evil.
What you then?
No, no.  I on holiday.
I nuttin' to do wi' dat.
Make it go 'way.
None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
No, I come to see Doctor.
Yes.
My Doctor Lady?
Yah.
You loved back?
I am.
She knows you real self?
She knows how she feel.
Rass!
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
No.  Nothing.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
Good morning, Jennifer.
The Board is waiting.
How long you here, Joe?
Black.
Don't bother asking, we already tried.
You're an original, Joe.  A little hard to figure, maybe...
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
Confused, huh?  About what?
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
You love Allison, don't you?
Oh yes, I do.
You think so?  How do you know?
What are you doing here?
I'm lost.
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Do you love Drew?
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
I don't have any.
Susan?
Goodnight, Joe.
Oh goodness, no.
Then why are you here, Joe?
Very well, I'll watch.
Watch me do what?
Whatever you do.
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
And I'll be a visitor.
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
I wanted to apologize, Susan --
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
I appreciate you --
Excuse me?
I mean I appreciate that.
Yes...
It comforts you, doesn't it?
I am, too.
No, I'm not.
Girlfriend?
No.
Gay?
Where are you going?
To bed.
'To bed'?
Almost.
I love your smell.
Thank you.
You're here?
He's taking a nap.
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
I loved it.
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
For how long?
I like you in a black tie.
We know so little about each other --
We know all that we need to know --
But there's so much to tell you --
Don't.  That will come later.
What will we do?
'Love will find out the way'.
'Love will find out the way'?
It's a saying.
I believe that, don't you?
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
Susan --
-- Yes?
You think so?
What a good idea.
I won't.
How long have I got?
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
Well, thank you for letting me know.
Not at all.
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Good morning.
Good morning, Bill.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
Sounds fair enough.
It is a deal?
Bill --
Yes?
Joe --?
How about giving a guy a break?
Make an exception?
That's what everybody says.
I'm not everybody.
I want to live.
What's it like?
What do you mean?
What's it like where I'm going?
Can you keep a secret?
Yes.
...I'd like to be alone for a while.
Now I'd like to be alone.
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
And more.
Why didn't you stop me?
I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
Dinner?  Absolutely.
Why did you go to the hospital?
I don't know.
You were just curious?
I guess...
About Susan?
I wouldn't put it that way.
What way would you put it?
Okay.  Goodnight.
I'm sorry, Bill --
What's okay?
I'm not hungry.
I couldn't sleep.
I'll be the judge of that.
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
Uh --
You are?
Yeah.
Thanks.
What the hell do you care?
You're what?
Those were my words, Bill.
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
I don't like what you're saying.
I don't expect you to.
Okay.
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
I told you to shut up.
I'll take it from here --  I am --
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
An offense --
Happy Birthday, Bill.
Not exactly.
Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?
You are --?
Yes.
Death!
You want me to be your guide --?
You fill the bill, Bill.
I do?  How long will you be staying?
You should hope quite a while.
Excuse me?  Could I say something?
Of course.
It just occurred to me --
'Yes' is the answer to your question.
I didn't ask any question.
I think you know --
What are you talking about?
Are you giving me orders?
Where are you?  Are you there?
It's enough now.
What do you mean?!
I think you know --
Where are you?
Get what?
Watch it!
The 'question' --
Hi, Bill --
Good morning, Quince.
How're you doing--?
I am, this is it.  B Day.
Next week?
But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?
Yeah, I give a shit.
This one.
You think Drew will go for it?
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
Good morning, Dad.
How did you know?
Does Drew tell you everything?
I hope so.
I don't like to interfere.
Not my birthday again?
I thought you were in a meeting--?
...There's a start for a meeting.
Do you love Drew?
Don't get carried away.
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
Well, I wasn't going to say that --
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
Bravo.
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
Thank God.
What is it, Daddy --?
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
You know each other?
We've met.
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
It'll come back, Daddy.
That was wonderful.
Yeah, it's good to get together.
Then what is it?
Where's Joe?
Where is he?
Where's he going?
What a night.
Are you relieved?
I love you, Daddy --
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
What was that?
Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
What's the way?
Nothing lasts.
I agree --
I could be her.
Not at all.
How 'bout another cup of coffee?
I've got to go --
Did I say something wrong?
You said you liked me.
No --
...We know so little about each other.
69.
That's it?
Hiya.
I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
What can I do for you, Leonard?
I'm sorry... um... ?
Condition?
I have no memory.
My wife.
How long have I been here?
Couple days.
So you're holding my calls?
What makes you think he's my friend?
Shit. Wrong room.
This isn't my room?
No, let's go.
This was your room. You're up in 304 now.
Why didn't you clean it out?					 *
Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
I know you said you didn't want any calls...
What?
Who did this to you?
I haven't made a strong enough impression.
I like your car.
Where'd you get it?
What the fuck are you doing here?
Do you remember me?
Yeah, I remember you.
Don't say anything else.
I don't want blood on them.
You think you can bargain with me?!
Take the money and walk away!
So you have information for me?
Tell me about her again.
Deals?
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
They treating you alright?
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
Did you?
What?
Kill him.
His name was Jimmy.
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
What do the police think?
What are you gonna do?
He'll kill you, Lenny.
Yeah, I hated it.
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
I told him about your car.
What's wrong?
Somebody's come. Already.
Who?
Calls himself Dodd.
Did you?
No!
Neither do I.
Don't protect him.
I'm not.
Help me.
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
Don't say another fucking word!
On the house.
My wife.
Sweet.
Dying.
What?
Beer, please.
What do you want?
There's a dress code?
What are you here for?
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
Well, that's me.
You're the memory guy?
How do you know about me?
My boyfriend told me about you.
Who's your boyfriend?
Are you Teddy?
My name's Leonard.							 *
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -
I'm not appealing the decision.
How can you read that again?
It's good.
You've read it a hundred times.
I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm -
Did you? I musta forgot. I'm Teddy.			    *
Yup?
Mr Gammell?
Lenny, is that you?
Unfinished business. What made you think I wasn't coming back?
You said you were leaving town.
So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
You don't know him?
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
Natalie? Natalie who?
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
What's wrong with this one?
Who the fuck are you?
Teddy. Your buddy.
What do you mean "bad news"?
She couldn't.
She has no idea who I am.
You're not coming?
This is a drug deal?!
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
My wife wasn't diabetic.
It makes all the difference.					 *
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
Yes, I will.
No, you won't.
Somehow, I'll know!
When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
You probably.							 *
No. You took them out.						  *
It is now.
Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles.
Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.
No.  I was in Namibia...
Yeah.
Turn around.
We know these people...!
I was the kids' godfather.
And...?
Sal Maguda.
He any good?
...eliminated one.  SWAT's on the next two...
What do you think?
We're not certain...
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
I don't know.
Yes you do...
Okay.  You got the "item"?
How many?
Two main players plus three.
My end?
25% discount on the load.
Make it 40%.
Make it 35.
You do.
When?
We want it back.
What's "nothing"?
What do you like to drink?
How fast does that go?
It goes very fast.
So where's the best place for mojitas?
The Keys?
Where's she now?
Mojitas...?
Later!  Do you dance?
Tell <u>me</u> everything.
No.
Died in childbirth, having me...
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
That's right.
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Cost less.  That's the point.
Is it December?
What do you mean?
Good samba dancing...?
Available cash is not an issue for us...
Twenty-eight-point-five.
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
Hola, chica.
I forgot the napkins.
They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
Do I need it?
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
Would you find me...?
Of course.
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
Yero, by himself?
No part of it wasn't real.
What's our deal?
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
And there's Dmitri...
The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
Stevens?
Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So...
Then it don't work.
Where we meeting 'em...?
What do we got?
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
No.
How much we looking for?
Where the hell are you, man?
Where?
Verdado.
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
You're not makin' a move on her...?
We're makin' moves on each other.
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
Hey, fuck him.
What is going on...?!
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
I am asking.  You to me.
What's your take?
Eleven to seven he blows it.
Twenty on my man...
Go ahead.
Hello?
Detective Crockett.
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
Guy's involved in a "meet"...
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
How?
So what do you want?
Yeah...?
Yeah.
Where's Riccardo?
On the phone.
It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...
Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
They had me from the gate.
Alonzo...!
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
You okay?
Yeah.
You sure?
...and thanks for the flowers.
You mean with the flowers...?
What's it say?
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
That sonofabitch!
And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move?
What do you care?
Then what were we talking to you for?
This the load you lost a while back?
I gotta, I gotta go...!
Alonzo...
You're hoping to get a look at what?
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Beg pardon, ma'am?
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
What you gonna do back there, East?
Lotta rich women back there...
Yeah?
Men, they mostly faggots.
Must be some mess back there.
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?
I can tell, can't you?
He's got taxi fare.
I ain't sleepy.
Okay. Never argue with a man.
You gonna beat me, Joe?
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't mind if I do.
For what?
For money.
For money for what?
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
Forget it.
You keep the sixty-four cents. I want you to have it.
You want some free medical advice, shut your goddam mouth about that night.
You don't seem like no fag...
You want me to stay here tonight, is that the idea?
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso.
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
You got a comb?
Don't need a comb.
Tell her, Ratso.
And what?
I'm scared.
These guys're good drivers.
They gotta be.
You get your first palm tree in South Carolina.
I read it.
Hey -- whatsa matter?
I'm wet.
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
What d'you want?
I simply don't have it, Joe.
Get outta my way.
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
Uh, yessir.
Ready for hard work, son?
Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida chicks...
You got it.
Sold. Let's go.
Yeah.
History, man, history. How much?
You got that, shit face? Asina...
It's there!
What?
Want me to take over?
What?
How's your hernia?
Anybody bitten?
Who?
Shit.
Haps, railroad, bus timetables?
Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
Where'd you get that limp?
The Hilton.
Why'd you do it, Billy?
DAD!
You know where they are?
Sure.
How far?
About ten kilometers.
Sixty Lira?
I'll pay extra
Would you recognize him again?
But just...
...are you with the Consulate?
How much you pay this joker... this cab driver?
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
Got a family back there?
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
What's your father do?
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
Girlfriend?
Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
How's it feel?
New people sometimes get on his nerves.
What they give you?
How much did you have?
How long?
Get the... midnight... express.
But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?
You got your stuff?
Okay?
Yeah!
What time is it?
We go back.
What?
After we're outside the kogus?
Oh we... we...
What?
Cut his fucking throat.
Max, sit down. You're in no shape to kill anybody.
I want to cut his throat.
It's already been cut.
You know where it is?
Hishradyo.
Why the suit?
Never was anybody like you...
You can't take anything seriously.
Billy, what's the matter?
My passport!
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
Cat, ah!  Ayip!
That's a great philosophy.
Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay!
Work, work, work, that's all do
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
His name?
Who?
What lawyer?
Hey, you can't...
What's your name?
The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."
You really love flashing that thing, don't you?
Immigration's gonna love you for that.
Peter...
Yeah...?
There's some weird shit here.
Weird shit...?
I think so. One right, two lefts...
And a right.
The Department of Public Health...
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
We'll be back at the platform in...
Did you see the size of that thing?!
Oh, that's gonna work.
You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
I only got...
Its muscles are locked.
A mistake.
"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
The kid...
The kid's with them!!
What do you-?
My God, what the hell are you...?
What are you putting that crap on me for?
He didn't do it!
Which way?
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
Please.
Do you think we did the right thing?
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
Metaxonycha Godmani.
Honey, just leave it.
I heard how you talked to him.
He was just doing his job.
Great crowd.
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
It's me. Can you hear me?
No, Jesus, no.
It's no use! They know we're in here!
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
Rub it on the windows!
What-
Peter-
It worked before...
The scent won't last...
Oh, come on, come on!
You go first. I'll be right below you.
Your arm, you can't...
C'mon...
Ah...
Talk to me.
No...
Hello.
You sure you didn't see one of these?
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
What?
It bit you.
This wing configuration. I've never...
My God.
That's impossible.  Insects don't...
What do you want to know?
Sure.
If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime.
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
Here.
What are they...?
You want to read it?
What's your new book called?
I don't have a title yet.
But what?
Nothing.
Pretty rough so far.
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
The profanity bothers you?
My daughter must be going nuts.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
Thank you so much.
For a while I thought I might go crazy.
I'm...
Done?
Yeah, thanks.
I DIDN'T...
Show me the way?
No big deal.
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
I want my pills NOW!
Here, in case you think of any ideas.
"HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!"
I can't write this anymore.
I'm telling you, I can't.
You can--you have the "gotta"--
What about a bee...?
What?
Have to wait.
To celebrate Misery's return. I couldn't have done it without you.
I hope you like it.
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
Well, it certainly says you.
Annie, what is it?
Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
You've been out of your room.
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
Be my guest.
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
I'm glad you like it.
Paul, this will be our legacy.
What things?
Yes, Paul.
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy.
Stop--stop right here.
What?
They're hauling Misery into court.
Just leave it, all right?
What is it?
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
It's good you found it.
Yes.
He's your client, huh?
Hey, Pete.
Buster.
Answer me a couple things?
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
Has she been buying any odd things lately?
Newspapers?
No, the typing kind.
Did they win?
Yeah. They're in the semis.
I thought you were over it.
Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
I thought you were going to dinner.
How grateful?
How I usually find you, Nyah.
How do you that.
Your room.
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
To win?
You picked another winner!
To do what?
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
Feel like pleading for your life?
God damn it, Nyah!  Why did you do it?  Why did you save that bastard?
What are you talking about?
An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i>
Fight a bit of a cold..
And you're happy about that?
What was the top bid?
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..
Not exactly.  Wallis?
More like two-two point two million.
Damn.  Just when it was about to get interesting.
It is, Billy.
Exactly where is she?
We're due to take off.
Range is two kay.
There she is.  I got visual.
That's it?  That's it? That's it?
I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan.
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
How much longer before you can reach him?
Do you know me?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
What if I pay the rent?
Uh-huh.
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
Where's the bloody -
I wouldn't do that.
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
What's you name?
Awfully short notice..
Care to wait a decent interval?
When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing.
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
They've got a book for this?
Which is?
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
What's the population of Seville any idea?
There's nearly 2 million in London.
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
I'd like a little more conviction..
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
And that's the only reason?
Much.
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
How's it going?  Everything okay?
Just like old times.
Just like old times?
-- his left jacket pocket.
I want <i>you out of there.</i>
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
Like what?
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
An idea, yeah.
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
You mean it'll be difficult.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
Yes, he knew.  Just..
..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
..I'm fine..and you?
That simple, huh?
Nekhorvich's boss?
Left jacket pocket?
Roger that.
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
Luther, I'm looking at security.
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
So what did he say?
A visit from an old friend.
You have Bellerophon.
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
To friends.
That's S.O.P..
But why tell us?
Heís putting on a show, Barnes.
Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
All ten million.
Krieger can get it.  Right?
Did we get it?
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
I'm walking.
Talking's good, walking's better.
Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.
No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
What happened to Jim?
There was nobody on the bridge.
They're dead.  Jim's dead.
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
Did they send you...Did they send you?
The message is for Job.
Max made a deal with you?
May I come in?
You don't think we're going to make it.
I didn't say that.
I just need you to be safe.
We did what we had to do.
Kittridge...
Okay...
Is this the only way?
Two cars.  Where are you?
Claire...Hey...
This stuff is so sticky.
This is Kittridge.
Go ahead.
Theyíre dead.
I donít think so.
No sir.
Yeah.  I follow you.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
Who else is left?
Yes.  I see your point.
Why was there another team?
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
What are we downloading?
Information.
What kind?
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you.
And I get to keep the equipment when we're done.
Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
Reach your folks?  How they feeling?
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
Why don't you come back with me?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
Who are you and what are you doing here?
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
That depends.
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
Like Job?
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
Why, may I ask?
That's the question I want to ask Job.
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnít prelude a meeting in private.
It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
Bank?
IMF mainframe.
Where exactly is it?
We'll see.
Merci.
You're not going to any meeting without me.
That's not it.  That's not the list.
Sorry, am I interrupting?
Give me the God damn gum.
Jack.  Jack.
He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
Higher.  Higher.
Higher.
OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.
The package is in the open.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím coming to you.
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
I'm willing to take the chance.
Forty-four.  Forty-five.
I guess.
You're going to use Walter?
He's our guy.
Iíve got a shadow.
Can you lose him?
Abort.  Thatís an order.
Where are you?
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
Yeah.
We donít have to, Jim.  Heíll come after us.
Whatís going to make him do that?
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
Youíre probably right.
You got it.
And get a doctor.
Loud and clear.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Why don't you take a look?
Jack...that's spying.
That's what we do isn't it?
Jack you're so wicked.
Too wicked to have a drink later?
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
Yes...  Itís him.
Whatís the problem.
Connection denied.
Try it again.
I always check the batteries.
Itís working.
Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
No, I'm going.
Are you ready?
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
Uh-huh
I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny.
Who's dead?
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
I have no money!
I don't wanna talk about it.
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
Rita. Pass the wine.
Thank you, Rose.
You're welcome.
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.
Okay.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
Hi.  Hi.
You haven't said anything.
Where's Ma?
Bed.
Here.  Ti amo. 
Ti amo.
You look tired.
What's your news?
Again?
What killed him?
In a month.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
He did?
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
What'd you do to your hair?
I got it done.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Who is this man? You're engaged!
You're my father.
Alright. I didn't see you here.
You haven't once said you like my dress.
Why you looking around so much?
It's wrong to just let them go.
I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.
Why didn't he call himself?
He's in Palermo.
What's wrong can never be made right. 
Yes.
Why?
I'm going to marry him.
Yes. Do you want...
I have no life.
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
That's it.
Loretta. What's that smell?
You don't have to help me.
I like it well done.
Loretta.
Where'd Johnny find you?
He knew my husband who died.
How'd he die?
Bus hit him.
Fast.
Instantaneous.
Why?
No.
Seven years ago.
How many men since then?
Just Johnny.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
You think so?
What are you doing!
I'm telling you your life!
Stop it!
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
Son of a bitch!
Where are you taking me?
I can't believe what is happening.
Me neither.
I've got you.
Get all of me. Take everything.
What?
It's so bright.
I've never seen a moon like that.
Oh my God.
What? What have we done?
You're trying to make me feel guilty.
I'm marrying your brother!
She didn't like me.
What did you do?
What did I do?
Why not?
Snap out of it!
I'll come to the wedding.
I'm telling you you can't.
But he wants me to come!
But that's cause he don't know!
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
Hi.
Hi.
You look beautiful. Your hair...
Who painted that?
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
Thank you!
So. Where are we sitting?
They get some turnout for this stuff.
That was just so... awful!
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
No thanks.
What do you want to do now?
What's the matter?
How can you ask me that?
You're making me feel guilty again.
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
I'm here!
You're late!
This is your place.
That's right.
This is where we're going!
Yeah.
I'm really afraid.
I'm afraid of who I am.
I was.
Let me go home.
No.
Let me go home.
No.
Ronny!
Is Johnny here?
You've gotta get outta here.
No. I'm gonna wait.
What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
Loretta, what are you talking about?
Loretta?
What!
Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark?
I got things to do.
What's the matter? You look crazy.
Bye, Aunt Rita.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Hi Loretta.
It's Johnny Cammareri.
You don't want the fish.
Maybe you're right.
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
You never have dessert.
Have Something.
I shouldn't.
Will you marry me?
What?
On the floor?
Yes, on the floor.
What time is it?
How near is she to death?
Then let's set the date.
Alright. A month. In a month.
A month from today?
I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.
Who is he?
Have you told her we're getting married?
I have no secrets from my family.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!
What?
Will you live here?
No.
Why not?
So we'll sell the house.
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
Hi.
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
Cosmo's cheating on me.
What! How do you know?
What the hell happened to you?
Your hair's different.
Are you drunk?
No. Are you drunk?
What? He's in Sicily!
No more he's not.
He's with his dying mother!
She recovered.
WHAT!! She was dying!
Do you love him, Loretta?
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
What about the moon?
Did you see it?
No.
I... a... slept with my fiancé's brother.
That's a pretty big sin.
I know.
He should pay.
I will. But I must find the right moment.
Moving in?
I came right from the airport.
So.
It's late.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
My mother's recovered.
That's incredible.
But why would a man need more than one woman?
That's it! That's the reason!
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
You don't know where Loretta is?
Loretta...
Have you come to make peace with me?
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
I'm sure she did.
Sure!
Thanks, comrade.
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
I'm not disturbed. By you.
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
Sorry. That was rude.
Will you join me for dinner?
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
That woman was a student of yours?
Yes.
I'll remember that. What do you do?
I'm a housewife.
Then why are you eating alone?
Go ahead.
Why do men chase women?
You knew that man?
Temperature's dropping.
No.
I'm too old for you.
I'm freezing
That's my house.
You mean the whole house?
Yes.
My God, it's a mansion!
What? What?
Look.
Oh.
Is who down there?
What would he be doing down there?
You were a tiger last night.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
You got me.
She's got it.
How do you know she is a witch?
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ...
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
Yes!
Where did you get the coconuts?
Through ... We found them.
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
What do you mean?
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
Not at all.  They could be carried.
Please!
Am I right?
Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
King of the WHO?
The Britons.
Who are the Britons?
Well, who is your lord?
We don't have a lord.
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
I am your king!
Well, I didn't vote for you.
You don't vote for kings.
The same!
NI!
Oh!
NI!   NI!
All right!  What do you want?
We want ... a shrubbery!
A what?
All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...
One that looks nice.
Of course.
And not too expensive.
Yes ...
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
What, "is"?
None shall pass.
I move for no man.
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
'Tis but a scratch.
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
No, it isn't.
Well, what's that then?
I've had worse.
Come on then.
Course I have.
Look!
What!  Just a flesh wound. 
Had enough ... ?
You'll what ... ?
I'm invincible!
Hello.
Well ... can we come up and have a look?
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
What is your name?
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
Ni!
Ni!
What with?
There!  Look!
We shall attack at once.
Who are they?
By what name are you known?
There are some who call me Tim?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
Greetings King Arthur.
You know my name?
A G...g...g...
Look, you're a busy man ...
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
Too late.
What?
Where?
There.
Behind the rabbit?
It is the rabbit.
... You silly sod.
Je...sus Christ!
Old woman!
I'm thirty-seven.
:I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.
Well you could say: "Dennis"
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
I've said I'm sorry about the old woman, but from the behind you looked ...
... But all the decision of that officer ...
Be quiet!
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Good idea, O Lord!
... Well, we did do the nose.
... Um ... Yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart.
Nothing... There's your ninepence.
I feel fine.
My name is Sir Launcelot.
What is your quest?
To find the Holy Grail.
Blue.
What is your name?
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
To seek the Grail!
Bring out your dead!
'Ere.  He says he's not dead.
Don't be such a baby.
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
When's your next round?
Thanks very much.
Who's that then?
Well taken, Concorde!
Really, I feel fine, sir.
Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
But, Mother ...
Rather what?
I don't want land.
Listen, Alice ...
Who are you?
I'm ... your son ...
You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
How?
Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.
Leaving the room.
Er ... if ... we ... er ...
Yes?
Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
No ... just keep him in here.
Until you, or anyone else ...
No, not anyone else - just me.
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
What?
Make sure he doesn't leave.
Where are you going?
Well, look er, I ...
What is your name, handsome knight?
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
Camelot ...
Why?
Well, she's got a point.
We'll cover your escape!
I don't think I was.
No.  It's unhealthy.
... I Bet you're gay.
Sir Gawain.
No look, really, this isn't nescess ...
We must examine you.
No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!
Back to your bed!  At once!
You got my note!
You've come to rescue me?
I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.
He's come to rescue me, father.
Oh!
They're all saying the word ...
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
You tit.  I soiled my armour I was so scared!
|      You turd! +      Mangy scots git!
Look.  I'm warning you.
Brave, Sir Rob ...
He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
Brave Sir Robin ran away.
I didn't.
Bravely ran away, away.
So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
I speak as I find, Archie.
So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?
How much?
Seventy a year.
Not bad, not bad.
How about yourself?
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
She loved him.
You know what I mean.
Which one of us is she flirting with?
So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
Aye, but will they?
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
What are you doing?!
I'm getting dressed.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
She'll be worried about me.
She'll get over it.
Aye.
What's this?
Be careful who sees it.
The place is a mess.
I can't move to tidy.
What's your name?
Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
Checked and locked, sir.
Mr Brown, sir --
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Yeah.
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
No doubt you've heard the rumors.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
It's the Queen's decision.
I wish to see my mother.
She's busy.
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
Do you know who you address, sir?
Whom you address.
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
It's so infernally cold in here.
Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.
We --
Checked and locked, sir.
How will I know?
How will I know what she requires?
You'll be sent a message.
I need a man who knows where I am.
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
Do you?
No.
Go inside at once.
Is that the Queen's request?
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
That can wait till the weekend.
There are important papers from --
What do you know about the Highlands?
I am a blank sheet.
Do you hunt?
Dare say you can be taught.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
I'm fine.
You're injured.
I'm not married.
Oh.
I wouldn't know.
What I do, I do for my Queen.
Maybe, once.
Then I envy yo.
I do what I do.
For Her Majesty.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
I said.  I serve the Queen.
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
They don't see it.
The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
They aren't as watchful as you.
Too busy looking after themselves.
The greasy pole.
No loyalty.
I promised to protect her from people like you.
She'll never understand it.
In time, she will.
Mr Brown.
Ma'am.
You are here safely.
Aye, ma'am.
You are well?
I am.
And the pony?
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
Mr Brown.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
Aye, ma'am.
What are those?
What?
Those, over there, there.
I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals."
Are they worth reading?
I am told so.
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
What does he know about the Highlands?
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
We took a nip of whiskey.
To keep out the cold.
What is it, John?  John?
Must they always follow us?
I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
John?
Yes, ma'am.
Has someone seen to those bruises?
Ma'am?
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
Then why send me back to them?!
You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
I came as quickly as I could.
What can we do?
Then they may read about me.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
Should we take it seriously?
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
The question is, do we need her?
What did he want?
Who?
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
A fine choice, sir.
Erysipelas.
Where did you find it by the way?
I'm sorry, ma'am?
Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
Just them?
It's Mr Brown, ma'am.
What is he doing there?
I understand he was in a fight.
How long has he been this sick?
A few days, ma'am.
We were expecting you to return by six.
Read it.
Again?
Who told them that?
I have no idea.
There is one other matter.
What is it?
I have a letter, ma'am.
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
Where is my son?
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
Why is he not here?
He is sick, ma'am.
What is the matter with him?
If I tell you, then it's no fun.
Could you play ARCADE with that?
We're having some problems with ARCADE...
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
It's the game, ARCADE.
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
He thinks I'm "sublimating".
What's her problem?
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
Hello?
I have to talk to you.
We are talking...
No, in person.  Now.
Can you turn off the game?
I'm in the middle of it...
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.
Change the channel!
Then leave her.
Where do we go?
That's what I thought.
...but then it hits the relay stations...
It's already out.
Then where do we go?!
SLIP-STREAM.
You mean we learn the rules...
Virgin sacrifices?
Jesus Christ!
You got the schematics?
Alex...
You're not coming, Alex.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
You feel it?  It's different this time.
Okay.  Give us a kiss?
One.  In case...
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.
Which way do you think Level Two is?
The clock's already ticking.
Shit...
Our time's up.
What?!  There's nothing here!
What the fuck is that?!
We can't reach that!
So that's what we almost died for?
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
Christ...no time...
I know.
So tell me you're okay, then.
And then keep on driving?
Go for it.
So how did you do it, Alex?
Yes...
Then we'll go home?
It's the wrong way!
It's here!!!
What did he do to you?
Is that your question?
I'm thinking!
Mom?  You're alive...
Of course I am.
So how do I start?
So what do you think?
It means she's screwed up.
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
So start at the beginning...
Adam, where are you?
What's going on, Cynthia?
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
What did you say?
They fired everyone.
Someone's shut off my money!
And?
You're broke!
But I'm not broke.
Cynthia...what's going on?
You gotta be kidding?
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
So what's the problem?
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
Howdy!
Beautiful night.
I agree with what you said...truly.
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
I understand.
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
I guess I've come to quite a place.
It's unbelievable!
I told ya.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
Your Aunt called me.
I was afraid of that.
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
Right. See ya.
A car ... a car accident.
My name is Rita.
Betty Elms?
Very pleased to meet you.
Yes, there was.
No. I can't.
Was anyone hurt?
Yes?
Diane?
Number 17.
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
I think I've been hurt.
No.
But, this could be serious.
No...I need to sleep.
What's wrong?
I don't know who I am.
I don't know.
Mulholland Drive.
No. Just the coffee.
Strange to be calling yourself.
Maybe it's not me.
What's wrong with that?
"Before I kill you."
What is it? What do you see?!
Those men in front, in the car.
Do you know them?!
Rita... I know what you're doing.
To my audition.
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
This Denny's.
It's kind of embarrassing but,
Oh boy.
So, you came to see if he's out there?
You feel it?
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
The one of 'em still alive?
Find out who they are?
Where at?
Palmdale.
So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
Making ends meet, huh.
Not here...no thanks.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
You must come in first place to move on !
Is that it ?
Good morning. What do you have today ?
What's going on ?
Where are we ?
What about Matt ?
Leave him, he's dead.
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
Now where do we go ?
How do we get out of this room ?
Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
Come on, it works.
So what do we do ?
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
What are you doing ?
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
What's the trick here ?
We drown.
So why this ?
Why did you build this whole place ?
Is this really the time ?
I wanted to let his family know....
You okay ?
Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
Where are we going ?
What was that ?
What are you DOING here ?
I work here, remember ?
That's a shame.
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
NO. Don't. You'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat.
Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
Is it over ?
That's nice.  I think I lost my wallet.
What's next Walt ?
Be very, very quiet...
The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.
Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
Hey, try swimming. It works.
What the fuck are you talking about.
You okay ?
Knock yourself out.
He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.
I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.
What ?
Don't eat at the console.
Not yet.
But, he's...
Stop the hydraulics.
When I think you're ready.
When will that be ?
He already had a balance of $600,000.
Why don't you just stop fucking around and just die !
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
Well ?
Fire the whole division.
Zach, how old are you, son ?
I am thirty two.
And how much do we pay you annually ?
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?
One moment dear... 
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
No. I am not a homosexual.
Are you happy with your salary and position ?
How long till the drug wears off ?
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
Bruce has just awaken.
He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
Was that the Old Man ?
There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !
What the ... ?
The power went out in half the park.
Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
Yes.
Really ? On a date ?
As appealing as that sounds...
Hello.
Hi. I brought some wine.
Are you okay ?
Hey... did we uhm, you know....
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?
I think we should follow him...
I'm talking to you asshole !
You don't have to sound so emphatic.
What ?
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
He was right behind me !
Hey good lookin' ! What'cha got cookin' ?
Why don't you shut up now.
Good morning.
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
You had to remind me?
Umm, where do you want this?
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
Excuse me I asked you a question.
How did you know my name?
Your Uncle Phil told me.
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
THANK YOU.
Don't mention it.
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
What about giving the other guy a break.
I'm leaving Sunday.
Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a little more.
Okay, no problem.
Visualize a spare?
Well you know what I mean.
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
No it's okay, I understand, really.
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
What boy likes you?
The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer
There's still a big spot on the floor.
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
I already bought a ticket.
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
Thanks, I needed that.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.
Hi Dad.
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
Yeah.
Totally groovy huh?
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
What happened to Shelly?
She just had a baby that's all.
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Never heard of him. 
How about a nice glass of milk?
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.
Maybe he's wet?
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
Oh.  Ohhh?
What're you saying?
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
Sure am, who are you?
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
Umm...can you come in for a minute?
I'm glad you're here.
You are?
Do you have any pictures if her?
Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
More than anything in the world.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
Hi.
That's okay.
It's just a corpse.
My mother can't have any more kids.
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
See you? He can smell you from there.
What's the matter?
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
Is it okay if I drink this?
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
Hello.
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
I guess you have.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
This is really very nice of you.
O.K. Thank you very much.
Hi there...can I help you?
My mother.
Your mother?
Thanks
Give it back Nicholas!
But we made a business deal.
Nicholas! What are you doing up?
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
There's water in your bathroom.
I want juice!
You're grounded 'till you're fifty!
Thanks....
No THANKS!
He said it was a gift.
You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
Getting off please.
Vada.
Get married?
What if you don't wanna be found?
You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
You ratted on my mother??
I think it's cool.
Just call us the &quot;dead end kids&quot;.
Boy, you're really into this.
If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.
And I thought I was weird.
You are weird. Let's just go.
This isn't just a mood ring.
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
Give it to me!
Come and get it.
Just give it to me!!
Just come and get it...right here!
DON'T!!!
...I dropped it.
Where are you going???
It's dangerous!!
You mean,  this ring?
Never heard of her.
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
My mother stood on this very spot.
What's he smoking?
What do you think?
Hey look!
And you'd be my cousin?
Yeah I guess...sort of.
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
Nick?
Some sacrifices are worth it.
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
An adventure?
Write me a poem?
I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
What's that?
Ten bucks.
What's it for?
For the mini-bike fund.
No problem.
Well Rose was being very thorough.
I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
I don't think the color of the interior is....
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
Committed?
Lock the door.
Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou...
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
A secret, I like that.
You want me to come with?
No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.
What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
There's plenty of fruit.
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
I think this place is just fine.
She'll be all right baby.
Bye Aunt Rose.
So what's wrong?
Nothing, nothing at all.
I was commenting on your hair.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
Good morning.
Well maybe for you.
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
Well I'm sort of involved.
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
They're enormous, I know.
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
What's this? December 8th, 1958?
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
Well you've gotta be prepared.
Why not now?
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
It would be fantastic.
But Dad'll never go for it.
Shelly?
Hey! Oh look.
He's so tiny.
Did it hurt a lot?
Let me hold him.
Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
He's a great poet.
He is?
Arthur!!
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.
You're such a baby.
Danny?
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
Keep your voice down!
What?
The boss is watching us...
This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss...
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
Can't you see it?
No.
Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
What Hurts Vada?
It's still available I hope?
They're dead?
Yes they are.
Stiffs??
Pardon?
I need the job.
You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
What do you mean??
Well the other night at dinner...
Oh that, she just likes to play.
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
I wrote that.
Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
Does it make it easier to win?
Kinda like men.
I had a good time tonight.
Home sweet home.
Yeah.
Are you mad at me?
Dance with me?
Here?
This is where we are.
I haven't danced in.....
What are you wearing?
Do you want to?
Want to what?
Kiss me.
Yes.
It's only eight o'clock.
Goodnight Shelly.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
How's it going chef?
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Well, you were pretty great!
Pointing upwards Look...
Did you ahh, love him?
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
VADA!
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
Of course not.
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Dad?
I love this guy! 
Dad??
What?
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
You never cared before.
She likes to play bingo.
Are they ready yet?
When?
We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.
I fall asleep at the wheel.
Hi Vada.
Hi.
What are you doing.
Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.
No sweetheart, you can't.
Why not?
He was allergic to bees.
He's okay isn't he?
Did I kill my mother?
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
Oh yes, oh that's great.
I'm very nervous.
Are you sure about all this?
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
Hi.
Sure.
Thank you. Bye.
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
How much does it cost?
Thirty five dollars.
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
I paid the money.
For this class?
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.
I wrote a poem too.
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
Cool, can I get one for Vada?
Cause she's dying.
Do you think she is?
He likes her.
Does he love her?
Probably.
She's shy.
Who's winning?
He's allergic to everything.
He won't give it to me.
Vada? VADA?? What happened??
My ball, I lost my ball.
Can we look around in your camper?
Big Ringo fan.
I would.
Did you read ALL these books?
Are you married?
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
Are you going out somewhere?
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
Have you ever tried any?
No.
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
Uh huh, why?
I won, I won!!!
NO!
Daddy??!?!?!
Well he just left, what's wrong?
I'm hemorrhaging.
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
How old are you?
I think it should be outlawed.
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
Goodnight.
Thomas J?
I'm allergic to it.
Uh huh.
Eeeeuuuww, gross.
Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place.
Oh great!
I knew he wouldn't come.
Hey look at this, no feet!
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
No, I'm going home.
She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer.
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
Oh no!  UUH.
Hurry!
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Naah, I don't wanna.
It's a mosquito bite.
Uh huh.
Your lip bleeding?
No.
What's wrong with your eyes?
Where's your bike?
No, I don't wanna.
Hmmmm, interesting.
What?
Hey, where does it say that?
Yes.
Who's that with your Dad?
It's my mother.
Do you remember her?
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
What?
Here.
Don't DO that!!
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
Pacifist!
I am not.
Bed wetter!
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
Can we go yet?
Woah!!
So?
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
You're right, let's knock it down.
What do you want it for anyway?
I am running faster!!
Jump in the water!!
But I have my clothes on!
Hi Vada.
Come on, let's go.
Why are you running away?
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
So now you'll have a mother.
I don't like her.
I do, she's real funny.
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
You can come to my house for dinner?
No, I'm hiding out.
Well when you get older, you just have to.
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
Not true.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Like they do on TV?
But, I don't know how.
Like this?
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
Just do it.
Okay, okay.
Say something it's too quiet.
Umm, Ummmmm
You better not either.
Well, let's spit on it.
Seeya tomorrow.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
What?
Would you think of me?
Yeah, it's in the contract.
I should look different.
Stay, huh?
You don't miss much.
Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
You think...
He can't do that to me!
We'll never be the same.
You have a real philosophy of life.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
I was devastated.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
And you believe that.
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
I wish.
Neosporin?
Try less appropriate.
Ben Gay.
I give.
I suppose it's too late to start over.
Two words.
Major.  Dish.
You're going to say it, aren't you?
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
Needing.
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
Can you watch the road?
You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.
I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
What else did he tell you...
Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
A trademark move, don't touch it.
And loving him means loving all of this.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
And the answer was so simple.
I was gonna predict that.
Jesus, we're trapped!
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
I just think you're wrong, is all.
But he always says...
Exactly.
He'll see right through it.
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
In one minute.  You are going to feel so foolish.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
I think he's been fired.
Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...
And she's all wrong for me!
Well, maybe we should talk ab...
Please come, please.
Such as.
She's too genuine.
Endearingly absent-minded.
Every day.  She makes the bed.
Waiter! Check, please!
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...
Where was that, Florence, huh?
Should I whistle down a cab?
Still.  All's fair in love and w...
You're not eating.
I never eat when I'm serene.
You never eat when you're despondent.
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
Big weddings are so strange.
Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.
You miss her, huh?
Don't you throw up on boat?
You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.
And I was thinking this could be our last time.  Alone.  Together. You know?
Where did we first hear th...
So we heard it... like, right that... that first...
I'm up against a deadline.
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
I forgot how cute you look.  When you get impossible.
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
This thing means that much to y...
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
What happened?
Should we take a walk?  Or maybe some food sent up, or something...
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
This is her family and her fault.
And your point?
I asked you...
Thank God you were here.
... your one chance for true happiness?
What's up?
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
Lower.
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
Why would she come here...
I never forgot that.
It's two weeks.
Almost three.
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
It's not just a gag, huh?
He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's marrying the wrong girl.
You got the money?
Well, that just happened that time.
What do you have to buy?
What?
Grand Old Opera --
I hate that music.
Winifred.
I won first prize.
You're from out of town?
Is there food?
I don't want to listen to her sing -
Don't feel that way, honey.
Barnett?
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
Don't worry, I'll take care or it
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.
I said, I've been real tired.
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
You going today?
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
You bet.
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
Well, I just thought I'd call.
Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
Whose word?
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
How is she?
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
Have you talked to Triplette?
Who the hell is he?
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
Who the hell is he?
He's going to run for president.
He has that sign with the tree.
What does he want?
Barbara Jean.
What!
That's what he wants.
You know better than that.
Well, how about the shopping center?
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
Hi. I'm John Triplette.
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
Whose?
What's he running for?
National television?
How much?
Where'd he ever see us?
Okay.
Bastard
President?
You're kidding.
Yes, but we're just singing.
Where are you going?
Hey!
National?
Come on. He's a crook.
Sorry to bother you, Bud.
Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
You bet.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
How in the world did he get shot?
Do you know Barbara Jean?
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
HI. Look at those flowers. Did you grow those.
Well, Mr. Green.
Hi, Sherry.
Mr. Green?
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
Didn't you get?... How are you?
Yes, sir.
Can I help you?
Yes, sir. I need a room
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.
Did you see who that was?
He is just wonderful.
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
What's this?
Replacement party.
You must really like him.
I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
No.
No.
You got a place to stay?
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
You in music?
No.
We don't mess with accessories.
Parts.
Do you carry door handles?
What kind?
Nash.
What year?
Nashville.
Oh... Well.
Next you'll be sick.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
I don't know his first name.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
Listen. Maybe I should go...
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
Okay. I'll be talking to you.
Bye.
When did you start singing?
Yes, it is --
Well, can you tell me why?
How long have you been with them?
About three years.
Do you ever do any writing?
Do you like him?
Hello.
Linnea?
Yes. Who's this?
I'm here.
Who is this?
Tom. You remember?
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
Hello.
Who is thin?
Who is this?  It's Tom.
Hello.
Wow!
Oh.
I've got a gig tonight.
End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
I have to go.
I have to go. He sighs.
I can't.
When did you think it would happen?
I'm not sure.
How old are you?
Thirty?
Well...
I'm twenty-eight
Oh.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
That's what you said before.
Oh.
Premeditated murder.
Yea.
They said go see the chaplain.
Hello.
Linnea?
You sound different. Is that really you?
What time?
Eight-thirty in the chapel.
I can do benefits
Hello.
Oh, no.
For him?
What for?
What National TV...?
An album.
Sorry I'm late.
You're not.
Where's Bill?
Sleeping.
Where are you going?
We just got a gold record.
How long have you been together?
Probably a little too long.
Do you study at all?
Come on.
Hi.
Hello.
I'm Opal.
Why?
Why?
What?
Pleasure
You go to school together?
Where are you from?
Southern California.
You always live there?
I know a couple.
Who?
Peter Finch -- he's English.
You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
You want a ride into town?
Is that good?
It's not bad.
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
You think it will?
Oh, why thank you.
More or less.
Yes you are.
What was the color of Tim's belt?
What kind of pies do you have?
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
Are we in a big hurry?
By all means, knock yourself out.
Mickey!
Using the same doctors is not common practice.
Who isn't?
Lobotomy Bay?
You've heard of it?
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
Yeah.
She was born without a tongue.
Say something.
What?
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Tough titty, it's mine now.
You guys stay on your bellies.
How is it?
Not good.
Do you have a back up.
You ready, Donut?
Ready.
Yes.
Whose ratings were higher?
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
How 'bout Manson?
She doesn't talk?
Not to anybody. She sings.
All right, Mickey.
Sorry about that.
Then was it worth it?
I'm sure we will.
Says who?
Says the United States of America.
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
Yeah, we have a van.
Where's it parked?
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
We ain't got all fuckin' day!
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
No fuckin' way!
Yeah baby.
And they made the first move?
I admire them.
Hypnotizing.
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Only on a much grander scale.
Yes.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
Here's the layout of the laundry room.
It's hard to say Capt'n.
Take a wild stab!
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
The entire wing?
That's my opinion.
How immediate is immediately?
Roger?
Rockin'!
Who?
What the hell happened to you?
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
Waitin' in the lounge.
How 'bout Mallory?
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
How's it working, Scotty?
Rollin'...and speed!
Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.
But how can you say that?
Ya know, I was.
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed---
What are we talking about?
I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke.
Where' you goin'?
Out.
Want me to come?
No thanks.
Who's going to buy me a beer?
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
It sure is.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
See Duff. He's the money man.
You think so, Frankie?
Boy - you hear me?!
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
'You Duff Anderson?
That's right.
Want to talk to you.
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
You a union man?
Want to keep your job, boy?
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
Yeah.
Where was that?
Walker and Williams.
Where's Wilma?
She done moved to Detroit.
Like where?
They say your dad's 'round town.
'That right? I thought he was up North.
People seen him 'round.
Where's he at?
Hey, boy - I'm talkin' to you.
Name's Duff.
How 'you doing?
Don't say much, do you?
Guess so.
Have anything in mind?
No. What you usually say, I guess.
Where was your father born?
His profession?
Well, he worked around.
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
Any other family?
No. Just me.  Me an' her.
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.
Hard to get up in the morning, huh?
You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.
Been over to the other mill?
Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.
Haven't seen you around, have I?
No. I'm new in town.
You working?
You work around town?
I'm a teacher.
Went to college, huh?
In Birmingham.
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
Your folks live there?
That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
You keep asking me why I'm here.
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
I like a place with lots of life.
How about another beer?
No thanks.
Hell!
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
Get out of here!
Let's go, Duff.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
What d'you mean?
You almost got into trouble back there.
No, on the porch.
Oh yeah, and then what?
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
Ain't your fault.
That's the way he is.
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.
Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
Just for the day?
I didn't know you had one.
Are you married?
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
That's right.
Four.
How did it go?
What?
Okay, I guess.
Thank you.
How about it?
I can see why.
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
Don't call them that.
What about him?
Is that so?
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Everything you cook is good.
What about them?
Am I as good as they?
Hmmm - good coffee.
You still didn't answer my question.
You know how to box?
My kids want me to teach them.
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!
I don't want to hurt you.
Huh?
Don't look so scared.
You jivin' me?
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.
What about your boy?
How come you keep askin'?
What the hell could you do?
No point fixin' it!
Don't do that!
How come you don't hate their guts?
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
What d'you mean?
Ain't you goin' to say something?
There's nothing to say.
Where're you going to go?
When I get set, I'll send for you.
Okay.
What you gettin' all pretty for?
'Round town.
Just get her drunk.
How 'bout the key?
We was just leavin', fellows.
A whole lot, Frankie.
Like what?
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
See you, Duff.
'See ya.
'You Will Anderson?
Wouldn't have known you.
What's on your mind?
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
How about a drink?
What happened?
Plannin' on getting married?
No.
I asked you somethin', boy!
That's right.
Better get him to a hospital.
How you doin', boy?
No, thanks.
Seems a little loose!
She don't look no worse to me.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
What did you say, boy?!
How often does he get like that?
Whenever he's got an edge on.
Come back some other time, will you?
No thanks, Lee.
Well, what're you going to do?
Going back, huh?
That's right.
They'll run you out.
No, they won't.
Don't be too hard on him.
Hell, I'm just like him.
Who is?!
Hello.
Guess it's never been easy.
Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
I guess I ain't.
I guess I'll rob a bank.
So I been told.
Well, if it ain't Duff!
'Musta knocked her up.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Well, I got married to one of them.
Hell, I didn't know you was married.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
I know.
Hi.
Come on, Will.
Let's stay here, Will.
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
He's your son.
Now you stay put!
I ain't drunk, honey.
What's the matter now?
Better now.  Where 'you at?
Let's go.
Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
How long's it been?
We got any shots?
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
What about her?
What are you doing in here?
Can you get us into Straylight?
What the hell is that?
A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
Alright. Let's talk business.
Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
You ran without us.
Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
Did you trace it?
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
You've got your orders.
An odd selection, Mr Case.
Tell me the words.
I don't have a girl.
Hey, bro.
Yeah. That was me.
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
What elders?
Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
We're doing fine. Take the next right.
Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
Jah guides us.
Who got you into this?
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
Never heard of him.
Can you take me to it?
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
Where the hell have you been?
Yo.
How much time you got left?
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
You're late.
This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
What about the route to the core?
What about the mainframe's access code?
Wait... You hear that?
Want to fucking answer them?
Hello, Case.
Case... are you okay?
I had to limit your options.
Why would you want me to kill you?
His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
Couple of months.
What about before that?
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
Maybe something's onto him.
You've been calling her name.
How long have I been out?
How soon is soon enough?
That's not going to help.
What the fuck... are you serious?
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
On a good run... yeah.
You okay?
Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
It sounds like you.
...Feels like you.
Case...
Case... it's four a.m.
I'll get the car.
Yeah... fine.
Case... Are you alright?
He projects with neural implants.
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
Is he going to make it?
We've still got to find the mainframe.
Shit...
I'm still going in.
Get up.
How are you at riddles, Peter?
What?
Thanks.
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
It is?
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
Right. 7:30.
YOU DID.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
No Roger from op/ed?
Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
You're Pam?
Guess who I did it with last night...
Roger in Op/Ed.
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
So, you were a geek. Big deal.
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
Now this is cute.
Bridgework?
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
Hi!
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
You need my help?
George! What are you doing here?
What is this?
Hidden camera.
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
Josie, you have totally transitioned.
Transitioned?
He is totally crunching on you.
Do I want to be crunched?
Don't tell me... You're Medieval Barbie.
Well, excuse me for caring about words.
Five-- Six--
Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
You've done five of my ideas.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
A flack jacket.
But I don't want it straightened out.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Have you been there?
Uhh, no.
Do you even know these kids?
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
Oh my god.
Rob's?
Hey there.
Maybe we should go in a different room?
Hey Rob, what's going on?
That is so--weird that you name your car.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
Better person than I.
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
Do you remember high school?
It was a long time ago -
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
No, I mean, no big whoop.
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
Is that true?
Better than I...
Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.
Wow, Josie- you look really-
Rufus?
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
Thanks. And what are -
Whoa. Deja Vu.
Dorothy Parker--
You like her?
So what are you thinking for college?
College. Haven't really thought about it.
This seat taken?
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
You remember that story?
Yoooooow.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
You have to say that. You're my student.
Boys.
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.
When are you going to open your eyes?
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Our penguin, right?
Do you think you'll find her?
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
Well, are you here with anybody?
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
Please. Please don't walk away.
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
Yes.
Why?
Josie, you look Rufus.
You ruined the whole thing!
Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
Aloha! Welcome!
Thank you.  I'm Rob.
Are you having fun?
Good. Gibby gave me champagne.
By name.
<i>                      I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
He <u>has</u> to know...
Shock.
<i>                                   ... Let's draw straws.</i>
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
Not at all!
He sure is big, Jack...
Where're we taking him?
Yes.
If you went away, what would become of me?
Coming...
Taste it.
No.
But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.
Uh-huh.
<i>                      Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
<i>                                     ... Birds of a feather.</i>
<i>                                          ... You're no fun.</i>
You got your room straightened out yet?
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
Where are you going?
Just out for a while.
I told you I want that room unpacked.
Oh, come on Dad...
Help me with this thing!
It's not the gas, Dad!
Come back here!
He needs professional help.  I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.
Jesse, help!
Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.
You two got a thing going, or what?
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
You got a problem with me, Grady?
Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
You remember your dreams, Grady?
I'm sorry...
What are you doing here?
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
What?
How come?
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?
Hi!  You didn't have to wait.
You okay?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
You know her?
I think it's sad...
Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
I don't know.  Where are we going?
Here.
Any ghosts in here?
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Anything?
Disappointed?
About what?
What is it - What's wrong?
Whoa!
What is it?
It's gone now.
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
yeah, I had a bad night.
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
Why won't you talk to me?
Jesse, God - what happened?
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
'Morning.
Jess?
Huh?
So, school going alright?
Okay, I guess.
Maybe we should call a doctor.
Jesse, please, let's talk about this!
Morning.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
Hi, guys.
All of them.
Yor dad picking the music again?
There's a Jesse on the phone.
You're going out?
We're going up to bed now.
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
I'll need to take her things.
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
And you don't want to keep him waiting.
What are you still doing up?  It's past one.
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
Can't it wait till morning?
Good morning, Jennifer.
Morning, Doctor Goldman.
Menthol, regular, ultra-light.
Girl, what are you doing?
I know who's trying to kill you.
So what do we do about this creep?
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
What's happening?
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
Do you still...see each other?
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
You did it the other night.
Freddy?
Joey needs us.  I can feel him.
Kristen, can you pull us out?
Are you okay?
He's gone.  It's over.  Please don't die, Nancy.  Please.
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.
Can't be good news coming from you.
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
What are these, beauty marks?
Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
I don't know...
You got five minutes.
Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
Fred Krueger's dead.  You always had a little trouble understanding that, Princess.
It's over.  It's over.
I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
Ms. Thompson.
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
Didn't get much sleep.
Sounds like a rough time.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
With Hypnocyl?
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
I can't believe I just did that.
Then maybe you're ready.
For what?
The truth.
You sound like Peter Pan.
We can try again.
What are we going to do?
Who would know where they were hidden?
Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.
Your dreams?
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
Okay, straight talk only in here.
What about Kristen?
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
How do we get in?
What was that?
What?
Somebody else is out here.
Science...I suppose.
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
How is he?
I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
This is stupid.
Why is he after us?
We're here.
I'm in.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
I'm a vegetarian.
Wait a minute.  What about me?
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
That was such a great evening.
No!
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
God, that's an enormous arse.
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
Oh Jesus.
Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.
No thanks.
Coffee?
No.
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
Thank you.
Oh hi.  Forget something?
Here we go.
Hello.  Hi.  Hi.
Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
Hi.
Hello.
Are you busy tonight?
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
Okay.
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
Too complicated.
Busy tomorrow?
I thought you were leaving.
Whoopsidaisies.
What did you say?
Nothing.
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't.
So who left who?
She left me.
She saw through me.
I don't know, I'm afraid.
Here we are.  Do you want to come up?
You've got to go.
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
Hi.  Can I come in?
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
Eleven.
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
My son's name is Johnny?
Well, get a message through to him too.
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
With a goat playing a violin.
You've got big feet.
No.  What's that?
You have a stunt bottom?
Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
Oh please sod off.
Wow.
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
Can I stay a bit longer?
Stay forever.
What?
Undressed like this, yes.
How are you doing?
How do you think I'm doing?
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
Hello.
I thought I'd give it to you.
Thank you.  Shall I...
Excuse me.
Yes.
Can I have your autograph?
What's your name?
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
He's bringing a girl?
Miracles do happen.
Does the girl have a name?
He wouldn't say.
That's right.
Anna Scott?
Yes.
The movie star?
... get fired.
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Still loves you though.
In a depressingly asexual way.
Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.
Yes -- sort of...
That's nice.
Bloody hell, this is fun.
Bernie -- this is Anna.
And we intend to use them!
Is this your first film?
No -- it's my 22nd.
Working with Leonardo.
Da Vinci?
By the way -- it's you.
Me?
Yes.  What do you think?
I was called and I came.  What's up?
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
What happened?
I'll see what I can do.
Still, not sparkling.
Ah -- no.  It's fine.
What's your name?
The others?
Mr. Thacker?
Yes?
Are you a fan of Henry James?
Ah... yes, enormously.
I did.
Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
Topol.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
Martin -- your customer.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
Max.  This is Anna.
'No comment' means 'yes.'
No, it doesn't.
Do you ever masturbate?
So I get the brownie?
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
Well?
So -- you've laid the ghost.
I believe I have.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
Oh God no.
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
Hello.
No, sir.
How about Miss Flintstone?
No, sir.
Can I help you?
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Does she know you're coming?
Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
What are the choices?
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
There's something wrong with this yogurt.
Hey.
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
So -- any messages?
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Try 'Flintstone.'
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
And she's in your house.
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
Spike!
I'll talk to you in the morning.
I wouldn't go outside.
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
Which floor?
Are you sure you...?
Yes.
How was she?
Excuse me.
Yes.
Bad news.
What book?
The one down your trousers.
Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
No, Miss Ratched...
And yet you suspect her.
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
M-m-m-ma'am?
Would you like to start?
Y-y-y-yes...
I was in luh-love with her.
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
Who? Tell me!
Get up, Billy.
Will you come with me, please.
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Sorry to have bothered you.
I wanna report a robbery!
On this ward?
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
Oh, I had them removed.
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
I'm not finished yet.
Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
That's it! We made it!
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
Mister McMurphy.
Yes, ma'am?
Welcome back.
Thank you, ma'am.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Gotta go now, ma'am...
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Please see to Mister Bromden.
Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!
What's your name, buddy?
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
So long, kid.
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
I-I-I'm w-w-wet...
H-Hey, M-Mack.
Marry who?
In ya go...
Say it again.
Say... God Bless America!
Ca-na-da...
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Sock it to 'em, kid!
Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are!
In there.
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
What for?
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
I second the motion!
Let's go, for Christsakes...
Yeah, Mack?
Yeah, Mack?
Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
Where ya goin', Mac?
Where's Martini and Scanlon?
They must be up there!
There they are!
Yeah, where we going?
It's the questions she asks.
What?
Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?
I'll bet a dollar.
Neither do I...
Yeah, my feet are cold...
Ya know what, Fred?
Martini!
What are you doing?
What for?
Lobotomy!
Lobotomy?
Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!
You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
With your own two hands?
Twenty-five dollars.
Okay, Harding, you're on.
Giving up?
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
What for?
I'm busting outta this place.
What's your plan, Mack?
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
I refuse!
I said out!
No!
I'm the coach!
I just started!
You can come back later!
I don't trust you!
Don't you have any clubs?
No!
Let me see your hand!
Gimme a cigarette!
No!
Why not?
Big king, too bad...
Just wait till you hear...
Hear what?
When?
Yesterday...
Who told you that?
Yeah, buddy?
Can you borrow me a dime?
'Kay, place your bets.
What's this?
Bet a nickel!
Right!
Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!
Yeah, Mac?
Gimme the ball!
I saw thum! I saw thum!
I wanna see it...
I wanna go home!
Yeah, it's cold!
My turn.
Jesus God...
Gary Blinker's fulla shit!
He's not!
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Poker!
Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
I don't, Doc...
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
You bet, Doc!
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
When?
Time out!
Time out!
Pardon me miss, but would you mind turning...
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
'Kay!
Yeah, buddy?
Are you a doctor?
You look pretty healthy to me.
I'm the next one.
How do ya know that?
Because I quit breathing.
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
Up an' at 'em, Taber.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah!
How much ya wanna bet?
Somebody's coming!
Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?
A dime.
Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!
Yeah, what's up?
No!
I thought I told you boys to go to bed!
Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!
Hey, how ya doin', cutie?
Hey, how ya doin'?
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
What are they?
Please follow me.
You know, I never got your name.
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
He's a patient, Rose...
Oh, yeah...
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
Who is he?
He's in charge.
Hi.
Yeah!
Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt.
Yes, I see it! I see it!
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.
After you, ma'am.
Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy...
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
Huh?
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
How 'bout twenty?
Now you talkin'.
Bet!
Bet you ass...
What kind of crap is that???
Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now!
Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.
Evenin', ma'am.
Is everything all right?
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
What are these men doing up wandering around?
What happened?
What's that?
What?
I thought so.
Is he in an asylum?
She was your sister.
No, she wasn't my sister.
Your mother.
Of course not.
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
Why?
So, what's the story with your friend?
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
Were they pen pals?
--separate, in the evening..."
Good.
You're sure...
We found each other, didn't we?
Your great aunt.
Oh no.  Do you?
There is one other thing you should know about me.
Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
A very large pig.
...has a prior commitment.
What's mezzaluna?
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
We'll KNOW.
But Faith--
You...
Congratulations.
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
Amazing.
Smoking or non-smoking?
Who's this?
WAIT!!  Where are you?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
Where are you going?
I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
That's not the point.
You said whatever it was you would understand.
How could you do this to me?
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
Why can't you just tell me?
If it's any of your business, yes.
Yes.
To the foot doctor.
Does he love you?
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
So?
Why not?
Uh, I'd rather not say.
Tell me.
I'd really rather not say.
Please.  I need to know.
Mickey Spillane.
Hi, Peter.
Oh.  That's nice.
And she's a knock-out, too.
Hey--
What?
What?...
What are you doing here?
You were saying...
Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.
How about music?  You like classical?
You okay?
Hi.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
No.  Are you're leaving?
Yes.  I am.
You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
Is something the matter?
There's no such thing.
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
Alright.  The truth is... I thought we had something here.
A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
I was hoping for the real thing.
You're Damon Bradley?
Hello.
Beautiful place...
Been here long?
Tonight?
Any night.
Sure.
I'll look forward to it.
Wait.
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
Sure.
Really?
Well, to-- new friends.
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
What looks good?
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
So what do you think?
Faith, this is my mother.
Oh, hello.
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
I don't believe in statistics.
No.  He smokes.
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
Scientologist.
But somebody wrote those songs.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
No.
Is he married?
No.
Is he gay?
What's he do?
I don't know, Kate.
You don't have any idea?
No.  He's never asked me.
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
Kate, is something the matter?
Larry brought me flowers last night.
Is that bad?...
Have you seen him with someone?
It's a miracle.
But it's July.
It's still the new year...
What about your job?
I have vacation time coming to me.
Live happily ever after.
This is a Lifestyles hotel.
Are you sure?
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
What are you doing?
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
What'd you find?
A Butterfinger wrapper.
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
We're saved!
What is it?
A phone message.  Only--
Only what?
What's that supposed to mean?...
You expecting somebody you know?
You think he misses me at all?
Larry bought himself cologne?
Her brother.
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
Because I'm the one who's single.
I never even got to be single.
He's heeeeeerrre...
Is he looking at us?
Faith--
What?
That was really sweet...
I meant about my idea.
Like a detective.
Hi-iii...
Hi.  Where've you been?
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Packing.
So, you've had a little bad luck.
I know, but...
It was a ouija board, remember?
What about Peter?...
Who said I was going?
Peter found him?
Joan Collins stayed here.
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
No one's perfect, Kate.
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
He's a jerk.
And Larry?...
And you are?...
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
Huh?
Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?
I came after the woman I love.
And you didn't tell her?
I have to talk to her.
She's not here.
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
Thanks.
I'll come over when I'm ready.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
Sure we keep records!
Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you.
I wish I knew.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
Then don't.
Working hard?
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
Don't say that!
ex-tanker who's walking on his heels ?
Don't say that!
What the hell!!!
I could have been better!
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
Father Barry.
What happened?  What happened?
Terry...?
Give it to me my Pop's job
What makes him so special?
I think we're O.K.
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
They play pretty rough.
Which side are you with?
I'm with Terry.
I'll get home all right now.
Everybody knew him. He got around.
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
You know how the Sisters are.
And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were
Man, you were a mess!
The moment I saw you.
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?
What for?
Here they come! The champion flock of the neighborhood.
You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
The things that go on.
How do you like that one?
Listen, you like beer?
Wham... .
How do you like it?
It's quite  nice.
How about another one?
A dive? You mean, into the water?
Shouldn't we care about everybody?
What a fruitcake you are!
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
You're not sore at me?
What for?
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
I can't let myself fall in love with you.
What are you going to do?
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
I don't rate it.
Edie... Edie... ..
Terry, what's wrong?
Who says?
Terry what's happening to you?
I just told the Father.
Told him what?
What I did to Joey.
You... .
What I did to Joey.
Don't tell me don't tell me!
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
Edie...
Terry, for God's sake.
Get out of my way.
Thanks just the same.
Am I on my feet...?
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
You are like
Where you goin'?
But you've got to listen to me.
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
A question of who rides who.
I want to see you, Terry.
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
Now don't give me a hard time.
Your gun.
This is my business.
Give me that gun.
You go to hell.
What did you say?
You can!
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but
You still call it ratting?
Are you on the level, Father?
Down to the wire?
You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
Never will be much too soon.
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and
Really?
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
Raise a hand to me and... .
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
I told you lay off.
How do you like them jokers? Taking me for a pigeon.
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.
Is Johnny in?
Give me a double.
Take it easy now, Terry.
No advice. Just whiskey.
Terry?  What do you want?
Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the last race.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
I'll bring him up to your loft.
Hey, Skins  --get away with that sheet metal all right?
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
Forty-five bills.
H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?
So-so, Johnny.
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
Not a dent.  Perfect
My favorite little cousin.
How'd you get that.
You got some nerve.
I was only talkin' to her.
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts?
Keep Charley out of this.
You don't think he'd be helpful?
Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
Maybe I will one of these days.
If I could get my hands on you...
Leave her alone, I tell you!
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
Where?
In there.
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
Can't we get out of here?
I'm not sure...
Look!
Those creatures..!
Don't let them hear you.
I'm afraid I'll faint.
The ropes are coming loose.
Be careful!
I am--It's our only chance.
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
Yes I feel it in my bones.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
You love me then?
But they are not yet one of us.
A situation easily remedied.
...And what is this?
A symbol, Master.
She came to us on the Day of the Dead.
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
She pleases me.  Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes. 
Ahh, she will be yours.
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
The moon is almost gone!
Ahh, there is yet time.
There are others.
The time...is short.
For what!?!
You mean...!
You may take her now.
Is there time?
You better hope there is.
They are live ones?
Live ones where only the dead should be?
Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
You know better than that.
We don't know of anything, Master...
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
Oh, is this Adele?
Yes, it is.
I want to speak with you, please.
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
You didn't visit him in prison.
He didn't want me to.
But you spoke to him on the phone.
He'd call every once in a while.
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Ask him his name.
You're good.
Adele?  You in there?
Oh.  Uh-huh.
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
You were his what, his box?
Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!
That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
They pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want, nobody'll know you.
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
What?!
Nice disguise.
I'm a tourist.
I guess Adele's in good hands.
Sure looks that way.
Let's go to Detroit.
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
You tell your sister about it?
Just hung up.
How long you talk to her?
How long were you with the girl?
Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
You find out?
You know they gonna set us up.
Half for doing what?
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
There's still time, take me up on my offer.
You ever wear one of these?
They found the safe.
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
They look like plain old rocks.
Come <i>on</i>.
Shit.
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
And then they'll kill 'em.
We made it, didn't we?
I'm going back inside.
Hello, Daniel.
You talked to him?
In the trunk, yeah?
What'd you talk about?
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
I have to qualify, is that it?
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
You get the key?
You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
You're gonna use a ram?
Yeah, why?
Leave it where it is.
Put it down or I'll shoot.
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
What do you want to bet?
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
Ironic, isn't it?
How are you, Raymond?
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
Karen, I told you not to--
There a problem, Foley?
How much for your company at chow?
I bet.  How much?
We're leaving.
The fuck you talking about?
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
Not until recently.
Nervous?
Why you're just a girl.  What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
Where's your gun, your pistol?
Buddy.  That's his given name?
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
That's funny.
You don't seem all that scared.
Of course I am.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
Uh-huh.
We still talk, though.
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
Really.
You know who this is?
Who was it answered the phone?
That's my dad.
Really.  He has a cop's face.
And your gun.
Think I could have them back?
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
You won't do that.
Why not?
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
I can go to the bar.
Don't leave me.
You like bourbon?
Is that how you think of yourself?
What, as a sales rep?
You did?
It smelled.
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
It's not a game.  Something you play.
Oh, God...
I called your room from downstairs.
You like taking risks.
You really wear that suit.
She did, huh.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
Where?
You were going to see her?
To warn her about Chino.
So she did help you?
You coming back?
Come on, Jack -- don't.
Pretend I'm somebody else.
If you don't, one of those guys will.
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
Take your sunglasses off.
Wait in the car.
In the trunk?
Whose blood you got all over you?
Okay.  How many going out?
I hear six.
When?
Looks like tonight.
Sounds high, doesn't it?
Thanks for your help.
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
It works.  You should try it sometime.
I still haven't made up my mind yet.
Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?
Foley?  That you?
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
You gonna write me a check?
I were you, I'd get up and run.
Islamic.
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
For a time.
Meaning?
Meaning time came, I left.
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
That time?
There were others.
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
I'll send it to you at Glades.
Do we have a gun in the car?
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
Take the next exit.
What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
Gee, I wonder why not.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
Gimme another hint.
You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
What-- when?
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
You're a fighter?
How you know that?
I can tell.
What's wrong with you?
Moselle Miller?
What do you want?
You like to sit down?
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
No.
Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.
He said he stayed here last November.
Your dog was killed?
Got run over by a car.
Was a she, name Tuffy.
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
It's beautiful.
It's a --
He's still married though, huh?
Technically.  They're separated.
Oh, he's moved out?
Then they're not separated, are they?
Can we change the subject?
No thanks.
You used to like it.
I really gotta go.
You were talking in your sleep.
"Hey, yourself."
What are you thinking about?
No?
Was it Foley?
He's pretty laid back, confident.
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
You wave back?
I didn't have time.
You gonna go get him?
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
I told you, he isn't here.
Out for the evening?
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
How do I look, mama?
Did you pay the guy the reward?
Faux goose down.
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
Foley's got it.
...the fuck is this...
You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
Are you sure they're here?
What is it with Red?  I've never seen him this way.
He was that good?
I wish she could forget him.
Do you always stutter?
Sir, I --
Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
Where's that lizard?
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
They ready, Earl?
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
Earl!  You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
It's Germans!
Good shooting, Danny!
Good shooting, Rafe!
Land of the free...
Home of the brave!
How could you do this?
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
We gotta face some facts here.
I was grieving too.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
Get me into a plane!
What's there?
They're all over us!
Land of the free.
I'm out of ammo!
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
No.  You're trying to beat me.
It's not getting any longer.
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
Danny...
I can't make it.
Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
Well...sure.
Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium.
No baseball diamonds, Red.
I heard what you did.
We can explain, Colonel.
Our doctor's gone too.
How'd you get this?
Boxin'.
What's your name?
How often you fight like this?
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
You take care, Dorie.
Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.
Oh, this is Betty.
I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up.
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
Fook ya!
Learn English, then!
I have'na been able ta --
What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
Do you have to wear that hat?
Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve.
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
Carol!
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
The only one?
They're waiting. Come on.
I can't. It's all too much.
Where is it?
Were taking you back to the nurse.
I'll call you Later.
Just what you underlined.
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
What's the matter?
It's that jerk Walter.
Lucky lady. Hi.
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
Charlie really has a great voice.
Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
And we're here on the couch...
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
But you love me don't you?
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
I know. Put Scott through college.
How do you feel?
You drive like a maniac!
Would you?
Looking good out there.
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
Yeah. Like that.
Where did you get that sweater?
Right. I promised my mother.
Is this slow enough for you?
Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved the way you kiss.  I missed you.
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
I'm sorry Charlie.
What do you know about classical music?
What am I going to do with you?
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
What are you doing here?
I just can't trust you anymore.
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
How'd you know about that?
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
Does this mean you like me again?
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
Oh, Charlie.
I love you.
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
I've got to go now.
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
Come back to me.
Charlie? Was I dead?
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
I'll never give up.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Are you for real?
I beg your pardon?
Take a long walk on a short pier.
Terry, slow down.
Terry! Slow down.
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
Don't get your hopes up.
I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
What're you doing here anyway?
Coffee and a donut.
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
I can't do that.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
Young lady, you're drunk!
Damn that Charlie I
At my age? Don't be silly.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
Hi, Dad.
For me?
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
This morning was good.
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
Jack, I was just trying to help.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
I have a note.
How do you feel?
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
When did you start drinking coffee?
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
Sort of.
What about?
Would you get that, dear?
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
What happened to you?
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
For what?
Maddy's party.
I'm not the maid!
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
What are you doing?
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
Don't eat the red ones.
Why not? They're my favorite.
You think this'll cheer Dad up?
I remember that dress.
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
What was?
Dancing with you.
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
You're giving me the creeps.
Am I dead or not?
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
Give me some credit, will you?
You're taking advantage of a minor.
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
Hi, Richard.
What are you doing?
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
What will they be made of?
In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
I couldn't help it  I loved him.
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
Wait! I'll go with you!
That's Renee alright.
When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
What happened to you?
Hey! Where're you off to?
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
All set?
So where're we going?
Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner.
Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.
What's his name?
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
Is this a good spot?
I'm not burying him here...
Why not?
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.
You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?
How can he not have a heartbeat?
What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?
Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?
I know, Mom.
Are we interrupting, Andy?
I don't know what to do, Bob.
What in God's name... ?
Bob...
Allright. Calm down.
What was the file name?
Do you really think so, Andy?
Why, Beckett?
Thanks, Walter.
This time. What about next time?
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
Thanks, you guys.
Aren't you giving an exam?
It could be parasites, an infection...
You're going to the office?!
One hour!
Drew!
We're not skipping this treatment.
What's wrong with you?
I'm not going to close the--
You don't think there's much time left, do you?
Maybe you should think about it.
What's that mean?!
Maybe you should think about it.
I'm ready...
Ready for what, baby?
Thanks, Charles.
Thanks for coming in.
I know that, Charles.
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
About my blood work?
Innocuous?
Client of yours?
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
Whoa-oh!  Sorry, I...
It's okay. Can I sit down?
New baby?
One week old.
Congratulations.
Little baby girl.
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
We?
I buy that.
Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?
Who'd you get?
What?
Find a lawyer?
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
What's her name?
Rayisha.
They didn't fire her?
There is no relevant precedent.
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
PARRTYY!
We're friends of Beckett's.
Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...
I'm a law suit.
Not bad.
Get it?
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
You think I'm uncomfortable...
Correct.
Uh huh...
Beckett?
What?
I've considered that.
What happens?
I'll look over the Q and A.
Particularly, Charles.
A regular all-American guy?
I suppose you could say that.
Except... you were gay?
Are you a good lawyer?
I'm an excellent lawyer.
Yes.
What?
Thanks for coming by.
What can I do?
Something like that.
In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
Gay movies.
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
Do you need a break?
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
Really?
Answer the question, please.
No. I can't really see it.
Hello?
I'm fine.
Yes.
Ms. Burton. You're black.
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
We're going to draw blood.
Why are we going to do that?
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
A homosexual encounter.
Get real.
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
That's correct.
Were you pleased with his work?
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
What kind of people?
Good school. What year?
Second.
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys?
You're the asshole, buddy.
How many gays do you know?
How many do you know?
Lots.
Duh...
Since when?
Joe?
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
Whoa, whoa...  What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
Going on... like...?
Yeah. But we took care of him.
You taught him a lesson.
So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
Let's continue.
This would be a good time to break for the day...
Julius!
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it.
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
Don't wanna miss this.
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
Tell me that was you.
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
Three full bottles. But almost time to refill.
'Mean the whispers?
You did this? To yourself?
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Power cells.
I got the quick-and-ugly version.
Entered our minds.
Had it with deals.
But I just wanted to say --
We can, can't we? Trust you?
Back to the ship, huh?
How many you see?
One or two.
As fast as you can.
You sure you can keep --
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
Just come with me!
They're already dead. Get on board.
Step aboard, Carolyn.
I can't....I can't....
Here. Make it easy on you.
Just give me your hand.
You'd die for them?
I would try for them.
What do my eyes see?
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
Christ, you don't know what's out there!
Like the light is scalding it.
Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
How many bottles?
Can we switch?
Hey.
Hey, who?
Amazing. I'm Johns.
And him?
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
Didn't bite.
Sorry. Thought I heard something.
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
So why isn't it all bloody?
Well, don't ask me to.
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --
60 years ago.
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
I never said I was.
You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
Smoke screen for what?
How much you weigh, Johns?
What the hell's it matter?
How much?
So you noticed too?
We cannot go through there....
Well? Is it just the pump?
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
You know who Muhammad was?
One is all?
Hasan?
They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
Imam. Slow down.
The sled as a shield....
Oh, no. No, no, no....
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
Which half?
What're you doin'?
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
SULEIMAN!
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
"God is Great," yes?
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
...then we saw this.
A toast to whatever he just said.
Very big beads.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
Think about that reward, Johns.
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
<u>Fuck me</u>. You said "clear."
Said "looks clear."
Well, what's it look like now?
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
So much for your nightfall.
Take it.
What, it's broken?
Dr. Zaius --
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
Do you have any weapons?
The best. But we won't need them.
You still don't believe me, do you?
What are you doing there?
No.
Look -- she remembers.
Remembers what?
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
Now, just a minute --
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
The evidence was very meager --
Got your sensors?
Yo!
But how long is a day?
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
Which direction?
That way.
Any particular reason?
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
Objection!
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
Huh?
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
Landon! Send a last signal.
It's no use ... there she goes.
Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
Scarecrows?
No cigar.
She comes along too.
Zira doesn't want your female.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
Shouldn't we be moving on?
Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
I think you're making a mistake.
He wouldn't leave her.
Who put them up?
The Hunt Club.
What is that?
Why special?
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
One is in a museum!
This is a joke in very poor taste.
With one of them.
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
What is your proposal?
Of course.
Tell him to pull back!
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
Speak! Go on.	Speak again.
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
Shhhh!
What is this?
It's him...Landon.
Which one?
You! ... You knew about this?
Maybe not.
What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
Why not?
Would you like to come along?
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
Do you believe him?
This is his assertion.
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
Bunker...
Elias is dead. Join up with the platoon. Move it.
I SHIT on all o' you.
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
We got boo-coo movement. 3rd Battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here. 
So what's the problem?
Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.
That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have.
You lame Taylor?
What?
Where's he from?
Where's Elias come from?
Taylor! Francis!
La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!
Where's Lerner?
Come on man!
Hey Taylor, you okay man?
First time?
But what'd she actually do?
...don't feel like it either.
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
Okay - got light duty, three days.
I volunteered.
What are the heads?
Must be somebody?
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
Merle?
Whew! - where that come from?
Found it. Growing in a garden.
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
You wanted to see me sir?
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
You could tell me your name. And where you're going.
How far does this train go?
Vancouver, B.C.
Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.
I really don't know.
Indefinitely?
I don't know.
Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.
Very nice Mitchell turns.
No thanks?
Not tonight.
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
Don't I even get my face slapped?
Would you mind?
I think I'd like to dance.
I think you're drunk.
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
Good morning. Can I do something for you?
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
And do you amuse the guests?
Would it make you anymore amusing?
Whatever you say.
Do you think I don't?
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
Dance?
They'll know whether he killed himself.
I don't.
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.
You tried to run away.
Want a spike in it?
Bad?
Bad enough.
What time is it?
Certainly not to me.
Want to dance?
Dance? Here?
I didn't notice him.
Absolutely sure.
You don't know who he is?
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
Us?
All right--following me.
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
Nothing matters.
So have I.
It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
No percentage in that.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.
Well?
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
If you're doing all this just for me.
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
I think you mean that.
Do you think I was faking?
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Beer?  Well, all right.
Beer or ale, Miss?
Ale. I don't mind.
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
I'll have to know a little more than that.
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
What this?
Yes.
Where's you get it?
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
FLorida?
You've had dealings with the police before?
You were there when I last saw him.
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
This isn't a very good place to talk.
I don't want to talk.
Points very straight to her.
They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
To do what?
I can't answer that.
What will they do to you?
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
I'd like a few words with you, in private.
You asked for it.
Bluff. You've waited too long.
For five hundred, what do I get?
I go home and paint the kitchen.
A thousand.
Got it on you?
Got the information on you?
Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
What'll you have, Margo?
Martini.
Sometimes.
And without much discrimination.
Leave that one lay.
All right, let's see the buzzer.
What's a buzzer?
Who told you my name?
How's life treating you?
The usual grind.
Round of golf Saturday?
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
Thank you.
I don't.
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?
Could we discuss that some other time?
A couple of hours.
I have a warrant for her arrest.
You'd be breaking the law.
Doesn't answer the question.
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
It could have been an accident.
That COULD BE TOLD.
No more for me, thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
How would you know, Brandon?
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
Mr. Mitchell.
A little something on account perhaps?
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
What are you doing here?
I don't think you locked your door.
Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
Send that?
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
What do I get for it?
You in charge here?
... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
I'll know when I find it.
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.
Not too hard, is it?
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
Was that about the right angle?
I think so.
Where's the shell?
Do I know who lives down there?
This is the shell.  What about the gun?
May you what?
Oh nothing.
Scotch and plain water, I think.
I never saw it before.
What about me?
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
Not if it clears the air.
It does.  May I go now? 
No doubt about that one.
How about Magruder?
He checks too.
That leaves two strangers.
So far.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
I don't know, sir.
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
But you still think she's innocent.
I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
Why should I mind?
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
What's this?
What does it look like?
How long have you had it?
You already have the checks, darling.
Of course.
How about your new friend?
Right.
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
I do worry about Susan.  Have you known her long?  She hasn't mentioned you.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
Shall we go?
Thank you.
Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?
I'm not sure I can face it.
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
Committed to memory.  Forever.
Attributed?
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
I'll have some of that.
...break away completely from--
Yes...You're not a socialist then?
No.  I'd want to--
Are you going to have coffee?
So it's all worked out perfectly...
What did you think of that Wadja film?
I thought it was tremendous.
I think it went on rather too long.
I couldn't bear for it to end.
And I didn't like that man.
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
Too bad.  What did your father do?
No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.
Damn.  They're early.
Who?
I called you a taxi.
Very thoughtful.
Why not stay?
I have to be up early. 
In radio we're different.
I think she liked me.
Did she talk about me?
I haven't really thought about it.
I might.
Jeremy phoned this morning
That'll be fun
In your car
Shall we have a drink or something?
Not here.
To the airlift.
To the airlift.
Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.
To the Fleet.
To the Fleet.
And the Argies.
Now, top secret file.
It's shit.
You approve!
That's enough of that.
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
Still in love?
Hello.
Hello.
Why not sit down and wait?
Oh, I see.
Have you come to talk about me?
What period?
What about the Cromwells?
It's that lady from Norfolk again.
Hello, Jimmy.
Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like.  She keeps asking when you're coming...
I've got to be going.  I've got a meeting tonight.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
No.
What would you call it?
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
Jeremy!  How Fantastic.
Darling Susan.
Don't point it at James!
What have you got there?
Promise?
I won't.  Goodnight.
Ah, Susy, it...
Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter.
Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
Thanks for stepping in.
Where?
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
I gotta be fucking crazy.
Ever done this before?
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
We gonna jump or jerk off?
Utah, you copy bruddah?
Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
Don't screw around man, pull it!
You first!
I'm not armed.
You gotta tell me where she is.
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
Wild ride, huh?
I'm not FBI anymore.
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world--
How was the beach?
Fine.
Surf conditions okay?
Babes.
They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
They don't go for the vault?
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
Big zippo so far.  How about you?
Got it.
Aw shit.
... so I started tailing him.
They're on their way to Maui.
The hell are they?!
Nothing?
I know where they're going.
Angelo!  Don't fire!
What do you want?
Who's the girl?
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
What's goin' on?
I can barely do this in broad daylight.
Look at you.
Those are cold.
Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
Ouch.
So what'd the other guy look like?
Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
My name's Johnny Utah!
Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
No way, old buddy.
Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
You're wastin' your time.
I'll see you there.
Thanks.
... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
You saw what?
You're looking well, Dutch.
Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
There's something else, Major...
Hawkins?
What in God's name...?
I think it's Hawkins.
Your uncle will like this.
He's not really my uncle.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
Please, we hardly know each other.
No.
What's that long building over there?
Storage, I think.
Congratulations, sir.
You've got a lot of nerve.
Mr. Harris.
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
What's that?
You looking' for some company?
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Sure.  For five bucks.
Sit... and spin.
Nice car.  Yours?
No.
Stolen?
Mind if I turn on some heat?
You're not from L.A., huh?
New York.
What motel you staying at?
<u>Ho</u>tel.
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
You like being a hooker, Vivian?
It pays.
So do day jobs.
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
Ugly habit, biting your nails.
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
For the whole night?
For an hour.
Three hundred.
Fine.
What's your name, lover.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Off the boulevard.
Room service.  What do you drink?
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Can I have some chips?
Do you plan everything?
Let's talk some more first.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
Uh-huh.
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
I think he wanted you to tip him.
Where are they?  Shopping together?
It's a very good year.
You really are a very beautiful girl.
Just a romantic, that's you.
Did you sleep well?
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
No?  Why's that?
I buy companies.
I sell them.
By breaking up a company's assets --
What are assets?
What?
It'd cost you.
Of course.  How much?
But you want days too.
All right, two thousand.
Three.
Done.
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
Never answer the phone.  Ever.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
Did you buy some clothes?
I got a dress, yeah.
The Rex.
Any good?
I'm sorry.
And that's the way the game is played.
I have work to do.
Okay.
Good.
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
What about dinner?
You always been rich?
You still mad at'm?
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.
I think it's exciting.
What id we run into someone I know?
You asshole!  I can't believe what a --!
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Do I look okay?
Edward, I can't.
Shush.  Of course you can.
What if I lose it?
What if someone tries to steal it?
Huh?
I more than liked it.
I know.  I'm glad.
One more night and you're finally rid of me.
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
I've never treated you like a whore.
What did you do to him?
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
I got tired of hating my father.
It was good.
I didn't think so.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
Cynthia's not coming?
Love this car!  Is it new?
Oh, god, what?
Edward, did you hear me?
But, Edward...
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
Yes...
Doing what?
Did I wake you?
I don't think there's any sense in --
You broke my nose.
I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
Carlos had some great rock.
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
In Beverly Hills?
Yeah.
Was that you?
Who did you think?
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
Kit...
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
Want a pair of boots?
You sure you won't come with me?
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
Yeah, what?
Kit give me nothin'.
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
Oooh, I love those.
You're a guest here?
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
What's your name?
I got a dress.
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
I think you'll find it normal enough.
Will I like it?
You'll like it fine.
But I always eat like this.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
What if they serve soup?
They will serve salad.
But what if they serve soup?
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
I like steak.
Then you would use your--
Hi, Barney!
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
Yeah, well, I check out today.
May I help you?
Are you looking for something in particular?
Yes.  Something... conservative.
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
What is with you?
Excuse me?
Yes?
Do you remember me?
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
Having a good time, Vivian?
Then I'm here till I die?
Till they kill you. Yeah.
He will come for me.
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
Should I be?
Brides often are, I'm told.
I killed him myself.
If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
He knows I do not love him.
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
With pride. What can I do for you?
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
Does it bother you to hear?
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
I fear I'll never see you again.
Of course you will.
But what if something happens to you?
Hear this now: I will come for you.
But how can you be sure?
Can you move at all?
I will never doubt again.
Singed a bit, were you?
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
We did it.
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
It never happened.
What?
Did you say, "I do"?
I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
You're quick.
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
I only dog paddle.
What do I do?
Probably he means no harm.
He's really very short on charm.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
It's you.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
The body?
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
Will this do?
Inigo.
He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
I brought you a special present.
What is it?
-- wait, just wait --
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
Because I can stop now if you want.
Oh no. No, please.
They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?
Someday, you may not mind so much.
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
Westley's only faking, right?
Who gets Humperdinck?
Yellin.
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
I tell you once again -- surrender!
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
Your guess is as good as mine --
And it is guarded by sixty men.
And our assets?
Now?
Now?
Where's Fezzik?
No.
No --
-- yes --
-- all that I have and more please --
-- offer me everything I ask for --
Sir. Sir.
Thank you for everything.
Sorry.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
You don't know any way you'll trust me?
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
I admit it -- you are better than I am.
Because I know something you don't know.
And what is that?
Who are you?!
No one of consequence.
I must know.
Get used to disappointment.
Go in, get after her!
I want to duel him left-handed.
But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
Yes.
I accept.
Inhale this, but do not touch.
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
Then make your choice.
"True love." He said, "true love," Max. My God --
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
Nobody's hearing nothing!
An hour.
Yeah, an hour.
Bye-bye, boys.
Have fun storming the castle.
Think it'll work?
You feeling any better?
Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
You are sick, that's why he's here.
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.
"By the light, by the light,
"Of the silvery moon,
"I want to croon,
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
"To my honey I'll croon,
"Honeymoon,

Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
I'll wait in the hall ...
Oooooooops!
Do the books!  Do the books!
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
Well, sir, it seems ...
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
What is that?  A handkerchief?
All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Yes, what?
What you were saying.  Keep talking.
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
Will you get a hold on yourself.
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
I already have.  Come on.
Right.
Everybody's a big shot.  Well, Leo, are you having a good time?
You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket.
Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
What is she gonna do here?
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
Do you think he'll take the job?
So much for Nutsy Fagin.
Maybe it's not true!
No way out.  No way out.
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
I never should have listened to you.
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
What???
Max, I...
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
Yes.
Yes.  We would!
Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
Come on.  Let's get going.
Min Bialystock.
Come on.  We'd better hurry.  We're late.
Call chauffeur.  Get car.
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
You, Blum go Motel.
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
Get car.  Get car.
Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees.
Finder's keepers.
Oh, the best one.
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
Like clockwork.
Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
Ta.  Ta.
By the sacred memory...
Of Siegfried...
Of Siegfried...
Wagner...
Wagner...
Nietzche...
Bismark...
Hindenburg...
Hindenburg...
The Graf Spee...
The Blue Max...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Heil you know who!
Heil you know who!
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
Where are you going vit the light?
I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody calls me LSD.
We are falling back on all fronts. Our soldiers are retreating.
Who can we attack?  They're all too big.
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
What did you tell the people?
I told them we invaded England.
We won.
I'm not the police.
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
How early?
Very early. Dawn.
The following morning. Sunday.
No one met her?
No.
Or arrived with her.
Back where?
How did she pay you?
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
I live there. Alone.
Of course not.
If she paid you well?
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?
Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
Let's all talk about Mary.
What's your interest?
Why?
Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
Casharoonie!
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
Yes, Mr. Lowery.
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
She stole some money.
A lot?
Forty thousand dollars.
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
What difference does that...
Did he say anything about my sister?
Yes?
May I talk to you?
Lila.
Here?
With you.
What's the matter?
What should I know?
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
I was getting to that!
What thing?
What thing could we be in together?
I hate tears. 
Is Mary... in trouble?
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
She'll need both of us.
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Arbogast said...
Sam! Why call when we can go?
Probably on his way back right now.
Sam, I'm going.
Just wait here?
Let's go see Al Chambers.
Who's he?
Our Deputy sleeps.
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
Of course we will.
Watch your tenses.
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
Hospital clean.
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
You can't go up there.
Why not?
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
I've lost my girlish laughter.
The only girlish thing you have lost.
Sam. This is the last time.
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
You can't laugh at it, huh?
I have to go, Sam.
Sam! No!
I haven't even been married once yet!
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
Don't miss your plane.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
Dirty night.
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
You eat like a bird.
Uncommon, too.
Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
I'm looking for a private island.
What are you running away from?
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
You should... mind it.
A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 
Why don't you go away?
To a private island, like you?
Thank you, Norman.
Very early. Dawn.
That's it. 
You slept here all night?
No, m'am.
Then I'm free to go...?
I'm sorry.
Wait a minute!
May I see your license?
Why?
Went out before service.
Just coming up to ring for you.
I'll take you to...
I'll get your bags.
Haven't any.
Satisfied with your cabin?
My mother is not dead!
You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
Leave me alone!
...Forty thousand dollars!
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Yes.
Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?
You didn't find anything.
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
Just before she died she came to--
Did she talk?
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
Who are you? What is your name?
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me--
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to call the police.
What is it?
The wound is bleeding!
What is it now?
I'm losing my blood!
You're losing your blood?
Yes!
What were you dreaming about?
A voice ...
That spoke to you?
That called ... commanded ...
Your father?
Yes!
Did you hear?
The child!
Yes.
There's no child here.
No?
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
But what about lunch?
I think so.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
I won't let you say that!
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
So that's the way it is?
That's the way I feel about it.
We'll be coming to the opening.
What! What are you talking about?
What do you think I am?
It happens that I'm the law.
As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
And they never proved anything against him.
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Which one is me? The horse?
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
I am right! I know I'm right!
Now don't that call for an extra!
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
We'll grant that.
No kiddin'?
Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
I don't remember. Not so very far--
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?
Call the Homicide Squad!
No foolin' -- any suspect?
Do you know George Winton?
Old Howard Winton's cub?
They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
It's all yours.
He might get some publicity out of it.
Cry-baby?
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
That happens to be the truth.
Who'd steal her body?
There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
You go in for dangerous things.
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
How much money have you got?
What is it? What happened?
A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
But I have some friends waiting.
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
Shall we unpack it?
She is the soul of that statue.
What are you laughing at?
Yep. Everything settled.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
Two: what if I didn't miss?
Mia...?
I've been dreaming about you.
I'm heading out of town.
Could you?
Where to?
A place you've never been.
Why am I doing this?
What universe are you in, Paul?
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
I've been dreaming about this.
Yes?
Nobody.
But who were they?
They were just bad men, that's all.
In what sense were they bad?
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
You better quit that.
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
You're going to get yourself up and go out?
Yeah.
You won't die, Rose.
What are you going to do, Rose?
Yeah, I know.
I do, too!
All right, what do you know?
You were up late last night, Brother.
Son, was Rose in your room last night?
I don't know.
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
Yeah, he's still up there.
Open that door, damn you!
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
What did you say, Brother?
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
She's getting herself up to go out.
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
I think Daddy suspects.
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
She's watching the car again?
I think she's gonna kiss him.
They're discussing it.
This is my place and you can't have it.
Wow! Brrrother!
What are they doing?
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
What are they doing, Doll?
He kissed her.
Is that all?
He had his hand on her titty.
She's putting the titty back.
No, Mother, he's lying...
Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.
Then why does she act so dumb?
Why is it taking so long?
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
That's what she would say herself.
No, son, she is dead.
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
Of course.
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
Well, she's back.
What time is it?
Quarter of twelve.
Is she all right?
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
Well, time will tell, won't it?
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
Darlin', Rose has got to go!
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
How is she?
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Rose, what are you doing up?
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Is anything wrong?
No, sir.
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.
Got yourself up?
How can the buttons stand the pressure?
You were up late last night, too, Rose.
Oh, anywhere downtown.
Strange voices, Rose?
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?
Tennessee?
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
Mine.
Yes, I am.
No, you're not.
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
Galley proof.
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
Took your time gettin' here.
Tell me about that job in Alexandria, Dave, the big motel you're building.
What's the matter with him?
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Well, you run on now.
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.
Never again, never again...
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
No more dentists, no more dentists...
Rose, you don't have to.
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.
You're not gonna see him again.
Indivisible and inseparable.
What and?  That's what I got.
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
How's your precious little school-marm today?
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
Lay off once, would you?
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
Thank you, concerned citizen.
That wasn't my fault.
I... I can't find my seatbelt.
I can work this.
No you can't.
Make a hole, Billy-Boy.
Relax.
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
Ah, jeez, Billy... careful!
"A.D."
Okay, we got... one, two... three...  Two Caddies and Poe's Mustang.
That's them trying to kill us.
Clench your teeth.
What?
Name one.
Who's been giving you history lessons?  Your bartender?
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
They... they shot me.
They shot us all, kid.
What day is it?
Where we going?
How you doing back there?
Gimmie a butt.
Happy Independence Day.
Why do I always have to sit in back?
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
Wha... ?
It doesn't say that.
Smooth move, hot-shot.
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.
Where we going?
I can't believe we're stealing.
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
You live like a pig.
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
No.
General Jim Beam, then.
You could start over again with cash like that.
There probably is.
He tried to kill us.
There'll be other chances.
Our resignations.
You going rogue on me?
You can't be serious.
I... I think I can... clarify...
Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
Pure horse.
Arriving tonight
You know... you could say thank you.
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
Alright?
We got him.
I'm gonna get beside him.
I'm gonna get beside.  Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.
You... SUCK!  You almost got us all killed!
You think this is so easy?
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
You put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate... make him spin out...
Any preferences?
Let's get this thing done.
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
You get him?
Been waiting long?
Just got here.
How'd we do?
Get his attention.
You John-Wilkes-Booth-ed him.
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
Know what I love about dynamite?
You see that?
You always did have style.
It's one of a kind.
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
I can't see.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Where am I?
Jabba's palace.
As you wish.
Han!
Luke!
Are you all right?
Fine. Together again, huh?
Wouldn't miss it.
How are we doing?
The same as always.
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
Luke.
You got her warmed?
I don't know.  Fly casual.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
I thought she was with you.
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
Someone who loves you.
What's going on?
I...
I'm sorry.
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
Han! Chewie?
Lando, grab it!
Lower it!
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
Good luck.
Here we go again.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
We're coming!
Come on! Come on!
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
All wings report in.
I'm going in.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
Oh!
Over there! Two more of them!
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
What do you remember?
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
He's my father.
Yes. It's you Leia.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
The Emperor has been expecting you.
I know, father.
Come with me.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Yoda, I must know.
Told you, did he?
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Yes or no will do.
Do you have any tattoos Brad.
Certainly not!
Why you - what have you done with Janet?
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
You promise you won't tell?
He might be.  I don't know.
Janet!
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
Yes Brad.
I've got something to say.
Oh Janet
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
What was that bang?
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?
Brad, please lets get out of here.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
It's just a..a party Janet.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
Weiss.
Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...
No, don't do that.
Maybe we could try it this way.
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
Good God.
A decision had to be made.
You're OK by me.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
Promise you won't tell Brad.
What a guy
What guy
"Sweet Transvestite"
From Transexual Transylvania.
Was all I had to say
Now I
Want to come again and stay
Oh my, my,
Oh, no no, no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Oh no no no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Who's Eddie?
Creature of the night.
I thought you liked them.  They liked you.
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
...I'm sorry.
...I don't know.
Looks quiet, y'know.
I think it's closed.
I just dislocated my finger.
D'you really wanna call?
Yes, I do.
Yes.
I think he might be worried.
It's fine.
It's only temporary.
I don't think I belong here.
It's okay.
No, I don't belong here.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
What?
...T-thank you.
Do me another favor?
I always knew you was pretty.
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
Ya puttin' me on, right?
'Bout seven.
Like?
Sharp -- Real nice.
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
Don't want weak legs.
Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
What did you say about a pet shop?
Is everything all right?
...Can't do it.
...I can't beat him.
Apollo?
What're we going to do?
...I dunno.
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
I can't go out.
Oh, Rocky!
Christ.
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
Don't talk like that to him!
You busted?!
You's the novelty, Champ!
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
My side.
Get that doctor.
No doctor!
You're hurtin', man!
Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.
You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man!
...It's very American.
How 'bout this Billy Snow?
Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
How was the flight, Champ?
Did ya get the license number?
She ain't retarded, she's shy.
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
I don't like ya face.
Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
No wine.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
No dollar.
...That's an old one.
We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun.
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
Few minutes?
...Ten minutes.
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
Six!
How 'bout some Cokes?
Cost ya a buck.
...How 'bout for the Cokes?
Don't hit the face! Not the face!!
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
What's ya name again?
A hundred an' thirty.
That's it, I'm broke.
That's it? -- Completely?
That's it.
What about for food an' stuff?
How'd you know?
You think I don't hear things?
Y'know I won't be able to work for ya no more.
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
No -- Just me.
Sparrin'?
Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?
...Screw you.
What'd you say?
Hey --
What?
Make your teeth yella --
Listen, I hope ya don't --
I won't.
Goodnight, Rocky.
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
...What?
I said, how ya feelin'?
How old are ya?
...What?
How old?
Come July, twenty-five.
...Did ya fight last night?
Yeah --
...Who'd ya fight?
Spider Rice.
Rice is a bum.
...No.
Think about it.
Did ya get the message, kid?
Ya puttin' me on?
Here's the card?
When was they here?
'Bout an hour ago.
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.
Yeah.
What's happened is freak luck.
Whatta' those?
How 'bout a glass of water?
Really think so?
Ya got heart.
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
I got pain an' experience too.
Yo, Benny.
Don't you care what the people will say?
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
Whatta you get outta this?
Don't let 'im get you tight.
God bless ya, Rock.
How am I doin'?
Real good.
Ya nose is broke.
How you holdin' up, kid?
Wanna keep goin'?
Would you keep goin'?
How I look out there, Mick?
I don't care what they say, you're a winner.
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
It ain't your locker no more.
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam.
No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more.
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
How's Butkus this mornin'?
Yo, Paulie.
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
My sister's a friggin' loser.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
Ya always in a bad mood --
I'm thirty myself.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
Ya sister knows I'm comin'?
What's ya sister like to do?
Ice skate.
It don't matter.
He's takin' cheap shots.
Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
How ya feelin'?
I got whiskey here.
Whatta you think?
Ain't sure, what's the story?
What?
Ya really like her?
Sure I like her.
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
You ballin' her?
Whatta these guys want?
Outta my house I want ya!!
...I can't haul meat no more.
...People talk to me more.
Apollo's a great fighter.
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
We don't serve formula. Snookums.
Well, I'll be...
Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
What's this, Roger?
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
Check the scrawl.
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
Do you think the rabbit did it?
So you decided to help him after all?
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
What's that comin' from the bar?
Sounds like singin'.
I'll bet.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.
You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
Holy shit, he's a Toon!
You?
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
No...
Does it hurt?
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know who I could trust.
Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
Hold on a second.
What a gasser.
What the hell is that?
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
One too many safes dropped on his head?
The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
I got him on loan from Disney.
When will I hear from you?
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
Have you got the will?
Valiant!  You surprised me.
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
No, I don't.
You tricked me, damn you!
Aah!
What the hell are you doin'?
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?
Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
Does this help?
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
Say, who's this guy laughin'?
Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
I'll get it.
Wrong number?
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
Two bits.
Yeah?
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
No, kid, you're a real hero.
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
I do bite my thumb, sir!
No better?
Have patience!
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
Then I'll leave thee.
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
A challenge, on my life.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
By my head here come the Capulets.
Good-morrow, cousin.
Is the day so young?
No, cuz, I rather weep.
At thy good heart's oppression.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Every man betake him to his legs.
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
Young Romeo is it?
I'll not endure him.
He shall be endured
My poverty, but not my will consents.
Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
Welcome.
Where is my Lady's lord?
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
Goodnight.
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Speakest thou from thy heart?
Amen
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
So thrive my soul--
By the hour of nine.
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
Why, may one ask?
And so did I.
Well, what was yours?
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
Meaning, to court'sy.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
A most courteous exposition.
Pink for flower.
I will follow you.
A Plague o' both your houses.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
Do you really think so?
It's under your seat.
We kept it...
And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.
Well I don't!
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
It's been known to happen.
Not to me, you know that.
From Interpol?
Lose them!
About time!
Do I need to repeat myself?
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.
I still am.
Is that right?
I better be getting that.
Duty calls?
I'm a patriate.
I didn't say I was.
Are you alright?
You sure about this?
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
Don't do it, Sam!
We'll double your price.
Do you have the material?
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
Do you have it?
Not so fast.  Who's that?
He's company.
Bad company...
Here's yours.
There's been a slight problem.
Where's my information?
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
And more importantly --
We'll die if we stay here!
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
But you hate each other!
Bullshit!
I swear...
Then where is it?
I sent it to myself in Paris.
Sent it where?
Is it done?
Gregor, is that you?
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
That's it.
There is one other thing...
What are you doing?
Don't cross me...
Nobody's going to do that!
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
He's tough, your American friend.
And you respect him.
You think you can stitch me up on you own?
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.
He sees this differently, as you well know.
So this is what, a test?
If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.
You shoot alright.
Not for long.
Long enough to shoot back.
Is that right?
It's been known to happen.
Yeah, well...  My way works too.
What a surprise...
They call me Swede.
Who's they?
You should watch what you eat.
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
I ride with fat-boy...
Where is this broad?
You should learn a little patience.
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
Perhaps the police?
To see a man about a thing.
Pretty much what you'd expect.
He says this is their block.
As in, they own it?
I didn't know that you spoke French.
What'd you say to him?
Same thing, isn't it?
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
Like Larry or Swede.
So is the woman.
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
I just wanted to see something.
How did you know?
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
It was at that.
A lot of people died.
I've seen a lot of people die before.
I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
You don't have to do this.
Alright, it's done.
You see the bullet?
You know him?
The Irish representative?
You sure your friend got the right place?
Dark ops?
Very ugly.
I never made that claim.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
How could you have done that?
They don't have the package.
What the fuck happened?
Give me a cigarette.
Right now?
I'm not here very much.
Business keeps you on the road?
So I do it.
No you don't, and you know it.
In a minute.
Do we need anything else?
Time to quit.
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
Because I don't walk away.
That's a good question.
Do you have a good answer?
Finish the job...
And now...
You son-of-a-bitch...
What?
You speak French.
What of it?
I know.
You better get some sleep, alright?
What happened to it?
Gone.  Destroyed.
Gaelic.
You sure?
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
It's the Irish tape we want.
Why didn't you kill her?
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
You put everything on the line because you...
My man, how you doing?
I'm alright.  And you?
Do you have the tape?
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
Can you get it?
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
I don't know what you're -
Ready to roll, partner?
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
Thanks for the loan, man.  I'll have it in a few days, I promise.
Never heard of it.
What the hell...
What are we going to do?
What do you mean what are we going to do?
Call it in I guess.  Why?
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
Well someone's gonna find them.
It won't work.
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
What makes you so sure?
That's right!
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
I've got one condition.
Shhh!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
Okay then.  I'll do it.
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
I can't do that.
He would have done it to us, right?
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
He's going to be trouble.
You're out of your mind.
You think he's bluffing?
No.
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
Not bad enough to kill him.
How long is it going to take?!
You killed him...
It's gonna be o.k.
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
Maybe we should say somethin'.
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
Do you have everything?
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
Then we're screwed.
We've got to go now, then.
That's right.
Oh Jesus...
He killed her...he killed her...
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
It's too late...
Uh huh.
And you're solid on that?
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
Why don't you get to the point.
Two thousand...
What are you proposing?
Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!!
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
Shut up, Jesse.
How are ya?
No.  Why?
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
What's that?
Has he?
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
Hi.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
Are you sure you're OK?
OK.  I love you.
You got me something?  What's the occasion?
You're worth every last penny.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
So do I.
I love you Sally.
A satellite dish?
When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
I don't believe it.
Sally, do you love me?
Yeah, I've seen him.
Be more specific.  A month, a week...
A week ago, at most.
Test the product?
What?
All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.
I don't know.
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Sheriff Hogan --
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Hello.
Anything I can help you with?
Anything...specific?
I don't suppose you've seen her.
Have I seen her?
Uh...C?
C?
Yeah I'd say C...C.
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
Very clumsy, very clumsy.  Id have found it in a minute.
Jesse?
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
Something wrong, Jesse?
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
What's this?
Hey where's the hot pad?
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.
I didn't say that.  You did.
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Don't you want to hear about my day?
You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
Dwayne put the gun down --
You'd do this to me?!
Dwayne -
Dwayne please calm down!
We're out of here.
I'm not asking.
Well you're not getting, either.
What do you mean?  You gambled it?
You're never getting that much.
I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
Hi ma.
I didn't know you were coming.
I was in the neighborhood.
Is that the mail?
How's work?
At least around here it does.
Well I don't know --
Anything in it?
There was more than that.
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
You think he skipped town?
This isn't right...
What the hell is that?
Winner six!
How much is that?
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
Is this about the funny money?
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
So what's your story?
I'm busy at the moment.
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
Oh, you American?
That's right.
You get massage from Chinese girl before?
No.  It's my first time.
Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
Those girls drove off because of you.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
You lied to me.
Hello.
What's wrong?
Carter?
Who died?
You.
Not Yu.  You!
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
Good at what?
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
IT IS CRAZY!
It sounds impossible --
I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
You sound like that all the time.
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
He'll be back soon.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
No.  It was my singing.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
Slow down, baby.
What did you say?
She's getting undressed.
Gimme the binoculars.
No.  It's not right.
What's she doing?
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
I don't understand?
Pick it up!
It's your turn!
Wait!  There's people down there!
There's people up here!
I wouldn't do that!!!
I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
Why did you help me?
I think we should stop talking.
Mind your own business.
No mu-shu.
What about a little king pao chicken?
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
Are you serious?
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
Hello, Benjamin.
Who's Benjamin?
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
We're slowing down.  This must be it.
End of the line.
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
What is Mac out?
That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
Carter...here comes the rich white man.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
Lee!
I did!
No you didn't!
Ricky Tan is alive.
Carter...
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this.
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
New York City?
First class.
The Plaza Hotel?
A little Mu-shu.
I could use a little vacation.
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
Put your arms around me.
What's going on?
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
Just trying to make it look real.
Why don't you go get them?
Are you okay?
Master Ching taught me.
Do you still have the bills?
Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
Shut up!
He stole my wheel!
He was just doing his job.
You have one of these?
You speak English!
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
It's the same thing!
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
-- what the hell is that?
That silly-ass look on your face.
Where were we?
It was not my intent --
What about them?
I know a shortcut.
You make the plate?
What plate?
The license!  You get it?!
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
Did you make the plate?!
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
Stooly.
You talk too fast.
Let's go.  Everybody take off?
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
Now, that's American music.
Yes, I know this song.
That's not how it goes.
Want some?
No, fish is a PM food.
Which one?
This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.
This concrete?  This is still America.
Oh no.
What?
Oh my god. Griffin.
No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
Not anymore.
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
I could get promoted right out of here.
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find em.
Oh my god...what happened to you?
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
Yeah. So why you look do down?
Any demands yet?
At this point we don't have much.
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
Shut up!
You a cop or something?
I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
You sonuvabitch.
Where do we find him?
Hello.
Ambassador Han.
My daughter.
She's fine.
Hello.
Han?
Yes.
It's Griffin.
You have what I asked for?
I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
What is he up to now?
See you at the wedding.
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
What do you expect me to say to this?
You look awful.
Got any last minute advice?
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
Good one!  Thanks.
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
That's it.  Back to obedience school.
And in a "V".
We do it to our dog.
It's hurting.
I'll get the dress.
"Sink the putt."
"Make the shot."
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
-- It's for you, Ike.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
Look, he's running after her.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true.  All accurate.
You're coming here?
Yeah.
Then come for dinner.
Of course we are.  Of course.
Then you'll be my best man.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
Get this man a Kamikaze.
Thanks.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
I don't think that's why she ran.
Unbelievable, she got to you.
Sorry, no.  I just got one.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
About her upcoming wedding and all.
I am just such a reporter.  And you are?
And you are?
I think you'd look good in red.
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
Yes, I am.  And who are you?
Your two cinnamon rolls.
Thank you.
They made me put my hat back on.
Originality is my speciality.
You're going to be very disappointed.
Everest.  Is that right?
Twice...
Really?
How romantic.
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
Too much.
Seven-fifty.
Five hundred.
Six-fifty.
Maybe someday.
You afraid to try?
Always a mood killer.
I'm a work in progress.
I don't know.
You don't know.
You look... uh... You look fine.
I'll have the same.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
Where did you disappear to?
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
It's fun!  It's high.
That was very interesting research George was doing!
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
About a minute...?
A little longer for me.
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
I love you.  I love you.
Yes, you!
Well, you do have the dress.
I'm okay with that.
So am I.
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
Reporter?
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
I'm going to kill myself.
Lighten up, wahine.
You okay?  I'm closing.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
Good boy, Port Hole.
I'm really rooting for this one.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
No.  It's my life.
You tell Maggie.
No, you tell her.
Is there somebody else?
He's got a houseboat.
I hate boats.
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
Am I what they had in mind?
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
Even when you were young?
Happy New Year, darling.
Walter, I'd love to --
We'll stay at the Plaza --
Go for a walk in Central Park --
What is it?
It's delicious, trust me.
Does it have wheat in it?
When you get back, I'll be gone --
What?
About forever.
You couldn't.
I do.
Beautiful view, isn't it?
-- it was a betrayal.
So what happened?
I told you.  Nothing --
At the top of the Empire State Building --
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
Oh!
What?
You should write something about this.
About what?
What was that about up there?
What's with you?
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
He lost all the weight... there.
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
No.
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
Men never get this movie.
Hello.
Turn on your radio!
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
Becky?
What?
Is this crazy?
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
Thank you.  I love you.
I love you, too.
I love that dream.
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
But he saw you, right?
You don't know who she was, Annie --
Becky?
M.F.E.O.?
You're going to miss the train.
Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
Honey, he wasn't right for you.
Maybe you should see a shrink.
I want my money.
Are you Annie?
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
Howard.
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
What?
You know.
What?
Magic.  It was magic.
It's a sign.
Sure you do.
Hello.
It's you.
Which means --
Grace heard it.
Who is this?
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
It's been about a year and a half.
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
What was it that made you know?
It's not that late in Seattle.
You don't like the one he was now?
Where's your mom?
Is he home right now?
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
It is not --
What's tira misu?
You'll find out.
What is it?
Dad, could you close the door?
Write her.
You think so?
It's Y. O. H.
Yeah.  What's that?
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
Do you want a fruit plate?
Dad --
It's a spice rack.
Dad?  About last night?
It's never happening again. Right?
Not.
It plays in 50 states.
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
Dad, I don't know about this one --
Oh, you're changing your mind --
P.  Dad?
Fine.  Fine.
So I can go.
Sure.  Looking good.
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
I'm sorry.  I'm just --
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
It doesn't.  They ask you.
Jed's got cables.
Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.
I know.
It was sinking.
Bye bye blackbird.
I don't know.
This one's for both of us.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
Listen to this --
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
It's a sign.
Why is she bringing that bag?
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
It's only ten o'clock.
Jonah!
Okay.
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
Don't ever do that again.
What are you doing up?
I was thirsty.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
No.
Everyone at work heard you.
I just called for a second.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
God, she's beautiful.
Who is Annie?
Have you seen my wallet?
Are you going with her?
Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
What's wrong with Annie?
This conversation is finished.
Did not.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
Get out.
What if I couldn't get to you?
When I found you?
If I didn't go.
I can't believe you flew first class.
What about camping?
What about it?
Hi.
Hi.  Sam?
Yes?
You saw her in the airport and then here?
It's a little derivative.
You look good.
He's ten.
He's good at it.
I read an article about this ...
I read the same article...
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
You're welcome to one.
Mornin'.
You haven't tried locking them up!
Got any more ideas?
Take a drink. Calm down!
Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
How goes it?
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
Who? A scab?
Are you sick, Mama?
Mama, can I put the candles ...
Why are they singing, Mama?
They are singing for me.
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.
We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.
But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen
Where you going?
This water's cold again.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
Never... never... never!
Was it expensive, the beer?
What's the matter?
Mother of God ...have mercy ...
A fighter, huh?
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
What were they saying? About you? In there?
They say I am no good to you.
Let them take it!
Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes.
She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
You all right?
I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.
How do you feel?
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
Four nights. How did you sleep?
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
I waited up till midnight.
Where are you going?
Hunting.
When?
Sun up.
Alone?
No.
Ramón -- you can't.
You mean Delaware?
Well, if that's possible ...
I thought maybe you forgot...
Forgot what?
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
Ramón ... listen for the love of God ...
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
Ramón -- listen my kids ...
Tú! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
My kids don't have enough to eat!
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
That's it?
Are you Australian?
No.
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
Bobby?
What?
What can I do for you?
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
Did you see his hair color?
What is it?
Ride 'em cowboy)
Who wouldn't?
First rate, ain't it?
Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.
Yeah.
Everything go?
I ain't a idiot, asshole.
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
What about the guy on the very bottom?
Leave me out of this.
Nothing.
Then leave.
I can't.
I can't leave.
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
Oh. Hi.
Don't worry. He's out of town.
How far out of town?
Miles Davis. "All Blues."
And you admire that?
Is that how you play?
What do you want from me, Colette?
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
It gets me through the day.
This has nothing to do with him.
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
How much time do you have?
What is wrong with you?
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
You don't like the tune, find another station.
What are you hiding, Danny?
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
Who is it?
It's me.
I'm kind of busy.
I need my paycheck.
You can still work.
He knows where I work.
Ass first into the world.
Why not?
What's wrong, Danny?
You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
Colette, go.
I don't want to leave you.
Oh shit
Who is it?
How the hell did we get this detail?
What time is it?
Twelve
Where to?
I know a guy.
I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
Why's that?
My features. They're Finnish.
You don't say.
You remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up?
Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
Fuuuuuck
Can you set that up?
You wanna score some go-fast?
Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
I think on account of his nose.
You're going to have to explain that one.
You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?
You want a hit?
Can I ask you something?
What does J.F.K. stand for?
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Was he the president?
Danny?
Yes, Jimmy.
But...I've seen you.
When? When did you ever see me use?
But... why? Why would you pretend?
I can't tell you.
You don't trust me?
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
Crank or glass?
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?
Not bad.
Can we talk price?
Make me an offer.
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
You're serious?
So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
You want to do this some other time?
Pull your pants down.
I'm sorry?
Come on, guys ...
Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation.
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
Shoot him.
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
Cool it. We got business.
I've got a hot one.
You got a name?
Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Danny, I'm touched.
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
Thanks for not judging me.
It's not my place.
I was getting to it.
What the hell are you doing here?
Question is, what are you doing here?
I was trying to score some dope.
This chink have a name?
You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.
You've got no choice.
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
Bullshit. He's a liar.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
That's because he doesn't have one.
I'm afraid so, Danny.
Jesus.
I thought you'd be happy.
Danny?
Whatever you say, man.  Look ... can we talk about this?
Please ... don't do this ...
This the guy?
That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
Yeah.  What about him?
Turns out he's connected.
To who?
He knows somebody ratted him.
Jimmy?
Who the hell is Jimmy?
That would be me.
Excuse me?
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?
Again, I thank you.
You, madam, are a heartless wench.
And you've got wiener breath.
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
You think that's a good idea?
What do you mean?
First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?
Just no pleasing you, is there?
My sentiments exactly.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
Where's Bubba?
What is it, drugs?
What is that? Rum and coke?
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
Find a chaplain.
Casualties?
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
Yes, sir.
Good luck, John.
So, where are you from?
You writin' a book or somethin'?
The Army gave you that?
That must be four thousand yards.
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
So, that's Ryan.
Yes, sir.
What do you think?
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
He ain't Wade.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
No kiddin'?
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.
In the shadow by those two trees.
Watching.
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
It's worth it.
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...
But you could have gotten killed and I...
Upham?
Pass.
I wasn't made for this.
It looks like a Renoir.
I've been humming it.
I heard.
It seemed appropriate.
You know classical music?
Some.
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
What is it?
That only leaves three.
I wonder where they're going.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
Captain, what about our deal?
Worked, didn't it?
What about the company?
Beasley's dead.
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
You get a translator, Captain?
Hell of a mission.
Uh, Captain...
PUSH!
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
Since when have things been normal?
You're kidding yourself.
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
How about I go right, sir?
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
You alright?
I think you're right, Keith.
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
There's always a bright side.
I'm listening, sir.
General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
No, sir.
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.
HERE THEY COME!
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
What deal?
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
Here they come.
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans.
Yes, sir.
You set?  Sarge nods.
FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
Frogs?
Lingerie.
I usually like surprises.
Damn fool.  Sir.
Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
So, where are you from?
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
You think he really believed it?
How fast?
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
Because he's guilty.
Understanding the following rights...
Speak with my lawyer.
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.
This evening is over.
The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much?  Because her family...
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
For going to school?
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Good for her.
I'll take the whole set.
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
Lloyd?
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
Yeah.
You're tough, J-man.
I'll be in my office.
No, no, don't go in there.
That's not even a scam.
What's a scam?
Then what's love?
Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.
Look at those eyes.
Lloyd.
C'mon, just do it.
Please?
That's just so embarrassing.
Hang in there, man.
See you tomorrow.
Did you sleep with her?
What does it say?
No, you're not a guy.
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
I don't feel anything.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
Lloyd is doomed.
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
He'd like to start serving immediately.
I can put that together.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
Lloyd, she's being difficult.
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
You like it?
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
I'm sorry.
I love you dad.
I just had a phone call.
Tell me, is it bad news?
No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
Which they did.  Let me finish.
Morning.
Dad, I'm sorry.
You should be.
Bon voyage.
Do you love him?
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
Dad, are you okay in there?
Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.
Honey!
Swear to god.
I swear to god.
But I found the money.
Honey, it's not what you think.
What am I supposed to think?
No, but you stole from them.
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
Hello.
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
Thank-you.  The real world.
Thank you very much.
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Yeah.  What a day.
Yeah.
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Are you busy on Friday?
Yeah, I have to help my father.
I'll go.
Pardon me?
Eight.
Eight. Eight O' clock.
Goodbye.
What are these?
So it's an honor?
So we can finally talk?
He does this every year?
Have a good sleep.
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
Nobody knew me before tonight.
That's cool then.
Twisted?
You know what?
Basic.  Hmmm.
Job?  Being a great date.
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Then call me tomorrow.
Today is tomorrow.
Nice one.
I think you should wear that.
You think so?
Me?  Sure I do.
Stop by later.
Okay, bye, I will.
Okay, bye.
You have to meet Bess.
Yes.
What did you say?
I just can't have any social life right now.
Be friends?
Yeah.  With potential.
Okay, this is important...
Are you comfortable?
No.
You're shaking.
I don't think so.
I don't think I am.
Then why are you shaking?
Your letter came yesterday.
It did?
No, we don't have to say it.
How do you know what I'm going to say?
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
What's wrong?
Well, I need to study, and...
We'll see.
Okay, what did we just decide?
No, no.
No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
No I didn't.
No.
Did you talk to Corey?
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
Did you tell anybody?
Just my dad.
Then don't do it.
What do you want?
I'm sorry.
Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
I love you.
One more time would be nice.
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
You're freaking out here man.
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
Uh... okay... um...
No.
The guy with the Datsun?
No.
Okay, I'll give here the message.
She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
Fine Lloyd.
How ya doing?  Is she around?
Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?
Seriously, Lloyd.
I'm totally and completely serious.
Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...
I know.
She's very successful.
I know
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
My car.
Diane Court.
Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
No way.
Lloyd.
Oh boy.
Hey.
Ooop, excuse me.
How you doin', brother?
Oh, I was just going to...
I was gonna...
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
I love you man
I love you man.
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
We're full on bonded.
How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
What's your name?
You know what, you'd like her.
Oskar, please -
It's not a charade, all this?
Luck.
Should I stay?
Should I stay?
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
All right, okay, let's talk.
We started without you.
They're not gone, they're here.
Scherner told me something else about you.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
You want these people.
I just told you.
So I'm responsible for the weather?
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
What do I got for you?
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
That's great, thanks.
God bless you, sir.
Like this?
How you feeling, all right?
Good.  How's it going?
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
I need a drink.
We're losing the war, aren't we.
Pots and pans.
Yes.
Better this month than last?
Christmas presents.
What other point is -
I'll talk to him.
Four hundred, four fifty -
Eight hundred, give or take.
That's very generous of you.
We need to talk.
They arrived.
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.
I'll talk to you later.
I didn't do enough.
Would it do any good?
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
Have you checked the...
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
He's broken his pattern.
I won't.
Don't. Think Bailey.
Shit.
What is it?
I heard a noise.
Outside.
Don't do that. Hang up...call...
What? I can't hear you...
Hang up...call...
I'm losing you.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Who is this?
Cici. Who's this?
Someone who wants to talk to you.
What if I said you?
What if I said goodbye?
Why would you wanna do that?
Hello? Ted?
I thought you were going to the mixer?
I had to change. Did anyone call?
Cotton.
Can we talk?
What do you want from me, Cotton?
You could start with an apology.
Did it?
Its over, Cotton.
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
Do I know you? You look familiar.
Tons and tons.
Where is Sidney's father?
And are the police sure about that?
Why don't you ask them?
What are you going to do?
Finish what my son started.
How do you put up with this Greek shit?
My documentary is due on Tuesday.
What's your subject?
Not one bit.
Where's Sid?
She dumped me.
No way.
Yeah.
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
About what?
This is exactly what I don't want.
Go on, untie him.
No. This is a set up.
Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
Two.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
She's got guards with her.
He seemed harmless.
Need some help, honey.
I really dont like that comparison, honey.
He hates Oliver Stone.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
So we found a compromise.
Just for you, Sid.
We had to have financing.
Hello, Dwight.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
I see you read the book.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
You have every right to be upset.
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
I know that.
Not good. How you doin?
You broke my heart.
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
Can we turn the light on?
And it's sexier in the dark.
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
..and as lonely as I am...
They're roomates.
Ssshh! What was that?
This is all too familiar.
Jesus Christ!
Let's go.
Dewey?
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
Dewey, there's no such place.
Who is this?
That's not the way we play the game.
I don't play games.
What do you want?
Where are you?
Oh--a God complex
What do you want from me?
No, wait...
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
It's good to see you involved.
Sid, I'll come with you.
What?
Are you in danger now?
Yes, goddammit!
Where is your attacker?
Lucas and his Romper Room stage.
I have rehearsal.
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
He tried to kill her first.
You're going to get it. You know what happens.
Knock yourself out.
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
What about rehearsal?
Who is that guy?
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
How many guys they have on you?
I've been waiting for you, baby.
And white.
You're not allowed to ask that.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
..it's really about family and tradition...
..harmonica style is okay.
Hello?
Gale?
She's not here right now.
I hate scary movies.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
But...
Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?
I get scared really easy, okay.
Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.
What are you talking about?
I'll be right back.
What was that?
If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
Jesus.  Hello?
Who is this?
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
Asshole, Can't talk.
More of a game really.
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
What?!
You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?
Where are you?
To see your reaction.
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
Please, call me Gale.
Are you sure?
What do you know about trilogies?
You mean like, movie trilogies?
Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
To me Hollywood is about death.
What does this have to do with Sid?
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Is that a threat, Detective?
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
The killer called her.
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
I can see nothing's changed.
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Sid I can see you!
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
Off the record.
I'm sorry, this is too good!
You're not a detective.
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Gale, your engine's still running.
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
OH. OH GOD. GALE --
What?
Thank you.
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
Who's phone?
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
What the hell are you doing?
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
Need to get in that building?
No really?
Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
Nobody said she was an actor.
Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Just because you knew her?
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.
Gale he's got Dewey!
I know!
Let's get out of here!
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
Huh, fine.
Page 22, Candy's big moment.
Who's this?
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
But you know my favorite name?
I'm hanging up right now.
It's Sarah.
Roman that's not the line.
What?  What movie?
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
Yes.
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
No I need to call you. Just you.
What? She asked.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
I didn't kill anybody.
How'd you do?
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
You ready to party hard tonight?
Dude. What are you doing here?
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
Ready?
I thought she was dead.
She can't get both of us.
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
You rode your bike out there?
Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
Billy? What the...
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
What are you doing here?
Close call.
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
Jesus, SHIT!
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
You know that's not true.
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
It's been a year since she died.
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
I wanna let go. I do...
Or even a good porno.
You heard me.
Are you serious?
Who did you call?
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
I thought you were...
NO! Don't believe him.
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
Yes.
Who is this?
Who are you trying to reach?
What number is this?
What number are you trying to reach?
I don't know.
Do I?
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
To apologize.
You're forgiven. Bye now.
I don't think so.
Popcorn.
You're making popcorn?
I only eat popcorn at the movies.
Really? What?
Just some scary movie.
Do you like scary movies?
I don't know.
Guess.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
Why do you want to know my name?
What did you say?
I want to now who I'm talking to.
I have to go now.
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Don't hang up on me.
Gotta go.
What do you want?
To talk.
Dial someone else, okay?
You getting scared?
Is this some kind of a joke?
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
I believe you...
So you better leave.
Where are you?
Please don't hurt him.
That all depends on you.
I wanna play a game.
No...
NOOO!
What kind of game?
Please don't do this...
Come on. It'll be fun.
No... please.
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Don't do this. I can't...
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
I don't know...
Come on, yes you do.
What's his name?
Michael... Michael Myers.
Now for the real question.
But you're doing so well.
Please go away! Leave us alone!
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
No it's not. It was Jason.
...leave me alone... please...
What door am I at?
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
And why is that? Has something happened?
Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.
No, not yet.
He's not a suspect, is he?
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
Evening, ma'am.
Deputy... good evening.
What brings you out to these parts?
You never know when or where a story will break.
Then what are you doing here?
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
I'll call for backup.
What are you doing here?
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
Does mom know?
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.
Did you reach my Dad?
You're sure it was the Hilton?
Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
Have they found my father?
Afraid not.
Should I be worried?
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
I was first to respond.
What were you doing out here?
Drive by patrol.
How is she?
She staying with you?
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
Jesus...
What is it? Where's Casey?
Where is she?
Casey! Casey!
What? What?
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
What's the delay?
How's the book?
I'll look for it.
I'm not here to fight.
Just stay back.
I want to talk to you.
Off the record. No cameras.
Have you talked to Cotton?
Many times.
Why would she lie about it?
Where do you get this shit?
What's your favorite scary movie?
Are you alone in the house?
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
So where are you?
So where are you?
Can you see me right now?
Uh-huh.
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
Hello?
Can you knock?
I heard screaming.
...out at the airport...
...so call if you need me.
Stu was with me last night.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Working, thank you.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Stop. Right there.
Don't shoot. It's me.
For about two seconds.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
Besides --  "Takes a man to do something like that."
Jesus, this place is packed.
So what's his reason?
And what would be your motive?
I thought everything was checked out.
What's Leatherface doing here?
He came to make up.
There goes my chance with Sid.
Wanna another beer?
Yeah.
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
Why are they doing this?
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
Why are you doing this?
You're crazy -- both of you.
Do you believe this shit?
Or a man's mentality.
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Thanks, Tatum.
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
Whatever. Just hurry.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
Just like old times, ain't it?
Do you really think Billy did it?
Take a message.
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
Shit, what is he doing here?
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
I don't know...
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
I thought you dumped her for me.
What am I? The beer wench?
Give it to me.
You don't.  It goes to court now.
What do you think?
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
So what?  This victim...
What's this: "I'm declining this case?"  It don't work that way.
Have you heard?
No, I haven't heard.
It's none of my business anymore.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
Yeah.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
What are you talking about?
It's always been like this.
He's being arraigned tomorrow.
Where was the girl?
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
What the hell's going on?
I don't believe it.
What's so exciting?
What time is it?
Give me the gun.
You didn't know.
Where we headed?
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
Murderers?
A woman...
Delusions of grandeur.
You should be thanking me.
Just keep leading the way.
Here he comes.
You just met me.
Not here.
Drop it.
Who said this was murder?
There's a bucket here.
It's a bucket of vomit.
Is there any blood in it?
You think it was poison?
It's my wife.
How's that?
What about sports?
You go to movies at least?
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?"  This is sick.  "The Honeymooners?!"
He must have left another puzzle piece.
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
And, if it's a threat.
Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
No fingerprints?
Nothing.
This is the one thing.
You're sure your men didn't move this?
Nothing.
What the fuck is that?
There must be something.
What?
And you don't?
I wish I still thought like you.
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
It is Victor.
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions.
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
Sorry about that... I just...
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
We don't know for sure...
How much money do you have?
Well, that was money well spent.
How do you know all about this?
This is a waste of time.
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
Modern Homicide Investigation.  In Cold Blood.  Of Human Bondage.  Human Bondage?
It's not what you think it is.
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
You're sure you're reading that right? John Doe?
That's what it says.  Jonathan Doe.
This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.
You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
Are you alright?
I'm fine.
Wait... just wait.
It was him.
We need a warrant.
Think about it...
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You stupid son of a...
What are you talking about?
We could use about fifty more men here.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
You do your job...
You knew I'd say yes.
Because he is John Doe, by choice.
Slut.
Stay with him.
Throw your gun down now!
Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!
Put your gun down!!
Don't do this... please...
Anything... anything missing or different.
Are you absolutely certain?
This painting...
Don't worry.  I don't wear it at the dinner table.
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.
How long have you lived here?
It's a hard place.
You should look into private schools.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.

Nothing for you to see.

How? She's even forgot her own language!
They'll be back...

Was your niece about their age?

I have to cut his windpipe...
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
Ellen, move aside...
Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences.  You know how it is with women.
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
It still worked in town.
Hey... the fuse.
Do you know where fuse box is?
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
Do you have a better idea?
I'll do it myself.
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
What are you doing?
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?
Cherry-red Tears.
I miss Tommi so much.
Who was that?
So, did you sleep good?
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.
Where have you been?
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
What? What am I supposed to sense?
Who's that?
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
It's important - he knows the last chapter.
How did you get me out of there?
Frank Kosinski.  Here's the address.  Go see him.  Ask him.
Hello.  Can I help you?
It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
Do I look like it that much?
Mrs. Straub!
I've killed my husband!
Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.
You didn't tell her!
Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
Well, look here!
Tenth floor.
NedI knowI know
Oh
The title won't do.
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
You are a gentleman.
Follow that boat!
Do you know that house?
Thank you, my lady!
What do you want, Kit?
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
You have the last act?
You have the money?
Wait!  Will you desist!
We have no Juliet!
We will all be put in the clink.
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
What is the chief part?
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
How much?
Ten pounds.
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
Interesting.
Nothing comes.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
How long has it been?
A goodly length in times past, but lately
And your relations?
On my mother's side the Ardens
So now you are free to love
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
I have a wonderful new play!
Put his feet in.
It's a comedy.
Cut his nose off.
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
What's the title?
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
A share of the profits.
There's never any
Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's DaughterAlmost finished?
So what do we do?
Where is the play?
Is it going well?
Very well.
No Juliet?!
it will be all right, madam.
What happened to Sam?
Who are you?
Do you know it?
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
It is all locked safe in here
God be praised!  Locked?
Who is she this time?!
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
Where are you going?
Now where? Will?
I feel a scene coming on.
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
Cut round him for now.
What? Who?
We are lost.
No, it will turn out well.
How will it?
Another little problem.
What do we do now?
The show must  you know
How will it?
How goes it, Will?
Wonderful, wonderful.
Burbage says you have a play.
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
Romeo isItalian. Always in and out of love.
Do you think?
The daughter of his enemy.
Good luck with yours, Kit.
I thought your play was for Burbage.
This is a different one.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
"Out."
Two hours at prayer!
Not ready? Where is she?
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
Be good to her, my lord!
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
What do you love so much?
And I love poetry above all.
When will you write me a sonnet, Will?
I am, Master Shakespeare.
Master Shakespeare
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
"Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
"Ay me."
"O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
Like you, I found him not at home!
I have, Master Shakespeare.
Who are you, master?
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
My lady!
Who is there?
Anon, good nurse. Anon.  Master Shakespeare?!
The same, alas.
Oh but why "alas?"
Oh my lady, my love!
If they find you here they will kill you.
You can bring them with a word.
Can you love a fool?
I do not know how to undress a man.
There is.
Even your play.
And that was only my first try.
You would not leave me?
No, the morning rooster woke me.
Oh, let Henslowe wait.
Let him be damned for his pages!
Oh--no, no!
There is time. It is still dark.
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
Oh, do not go
Oh, Will!
That's my line!
You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
Will! What--?
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love.
An excellent beginning  Let him bea duke. And your heroine?
But all ends well.
How does it?
My lady Viola.
My lord.
I have spoken with your father.
My lady VIOLA.
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
But why me?
Will you defy your father and your Queen?
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
I am going to church.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
Take off your hat.
Wait there.
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
Yes, sir.
Do you understand me?
I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen Act Two.
And break her heart and mine?
But what of Lord Wessex?
Here we come at last, my lord!
Is there a man?
You are on my ground.
What's his name?
All right, just a few questions.
Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
I was trying to educate you.
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
Will you shut up and play.
You're a bad loser.
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
What do you think?
About what?
About this guy, this Hugo person.
I don't have time.
He made it clear.
Have you seen him?
Alex, I don't have the time --
No.
Think about it.
No.
No.
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
He couldn't get his car started.
When are you going to let the police know?
You call them if you want.
So who's going to do it?
Dig the pit, I don't know.
No, not that.
Then what? Who's going to do what?
You know what I'm talking about.
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
I can't do it.
I don't hear this.
I just thought we should discuss it.
Finished.
But not quite.
Don't you worry about that.
That was good.
Can we talk about something?
What's the problem?
I want to talk now.
How much did you pay?
I don't know.
How much did you pay?
I don't know.
How much?
What is this?
Security.
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
There was a break-in.
What's all this for, more security?
I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
What? Yes, that's fine.
You're sure? There's lots more.
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You're not eating.
Not eating like you used to, that's what.
You looking for me?
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
Who?
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
Where do you think you'll go?
Cover it?
Well?
I don't know.
Is this being recorded?
Are you recording it?
What does it look like?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
I've never seen any of these men before.
Take another look at these two.
Well, is it?
What?
That's it, then.
That's all?
Sorry to waste your time.
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Just one thing.
That's right.
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
Yes.
And you like it?
Cameron.
Cameron?
Yes.
Did you know --
Aroused and inflamed.
I'm not usually drunk.
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
-- instead of what he is --
What I am.
-- which is --
-- which is a hack.
Know and love?
Yeah.
I think you're lying.
You see, they don't really know me.
Have you seen Hugo?
David hasn't seen him either.
So I gathered.
Maybe he didn't like us.
Hugo.
His car's still there.
He's got a car?
So what's wrong with that?
What sort of car?
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
So?
Yes.
Now?
Yes.
Alex.
What? What's wrong?
What are you doing?
I'm just looking.
Don't look?
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
No, Alex. It's, it's --
Unfeasible.
Who's going to do it?
I thought we all were.
I don't want to. It's different.
OK.
Love and happiness for ever.
David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
Look over there. It's Cameron.
Who?
What's he doing here?
Hello. Hello.
Are you all right?
No.
Will you calm down.
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
You know we're right.
Leave him alone.
He can't stay up there.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
Boy, am I glad to see you.
What are you doing here?
We have to talk.
Later. But first -- him.
David?
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
And the money?
We could put it somewhere.
Where he can't get it?
Now you thought of that, not me.
No.
Aren't you going to answer it?
It's the only way.
I refuse.
You'll wait in the hall?
Alex.
Are you all right?
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
It's about me and David.
The perfect couple, I should say.
Don't you ever stop?
Interesting.
So, uh...
What?
It's OK. There's no problem.
You mean I can have the room?
What about?
Downstairs.
Of course.
did you hear anything before he cries?
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
Two?
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
Is this where no one stays?
No, I've never seen them.
You're sure of that.
Why do you want a room here?
Just get on with it, Alex.
I've never seen a dead body before.
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
Do you know many of these people?
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
Two hundred.
Two hundred pounds?
Two hundred pounds.
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
Expecting anyone?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
No one. I promise.
Who have you talked to?
No one.
I thought you'd gone to work.
I'm sorry.
So let's go.
Yes.
Sorry?
Here.
Right here?
In this firm.
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
Eh --
But they sneer, don't they?
I'm boring?
You get the job done.
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
Hello.
What happened to that guy?
What guy?
What guy that died?
Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
Oh, him. Well, he died.
You must be Hugo.
Would you like to come in?
What's it about?
A priest who dies.
Writing seems easy.
No.
It was some guy called Brian.
Did he sound upset?
Working nights?
I'm a doctor.
And he's a patient of yours?
No. But he needs treatment.
For what?
A certain weakness.
The human condition.
You know about it?
I write about it?
Take all the time you like, doctor.
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
I suppose so.
Offering it for debate.
Your watch.
Is it real?
You're in a good mood today, George.
Chicken salad.
Anyway, you remember Harold?
Don't you think there's too much gold?
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
I thought you were in a good mood.
Don't you like her?
No, it's a very groovy girl.
Who?
Maybe... why do you ask?
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
What do you expect me to do about it?
Lester.
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
We cannot go into this later.
What are you talking about?
Thanks a lot.
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
She's got a...
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
Yeah, I think so.
I don't know.
Gee, that's very serious...
I know.
She did?
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
I'll be back in a while.
I don't want to see you anymore.
You're late, George.
I gotta talk to you.
I don't want to talk about it...
But you don't know what happened.
-- What?
Nummers.
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
I don't want to place you in any position --
-- to be put in that kind of position...
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
I can see that.
You're looking great, baby.
What're you doing later?
Why don't you see Lester?
Your husband?
Is she all right?
-- Anyway.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
No, I know.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
Hi.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
But aren't you...
She what?
She's a friend of Jill's.
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
Oh, no.
... what?...
You going to answer it?
Want me to?
You're rude. I mean, you're very rude.
Well, is she your girlfriend?
Her?
Are you?
No.
Then it's not your problem.
No. You know too many sick ladies.
I guess so.
Shit.
No thanks.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
I do her hair, yeah.
No thanks.
Did you hear me?
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
Have you ever made it with a girl?
Well, are you?
Am I what?
... just, you could look very heavy...
Don't make conversation with me.
I never get my hair done.
No.
Then what do you think?
That you're just like your mother.
I am not like my mother!
You are.
I am not!
I am not!
Right now?
Right.
How is she?
Great.
Wonderful woman.
Right.
And you need money?
You do know what money's like these days.
What sort of references do you have?
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Pardon me?
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
George!
Buffums?
Yes, Buffums.
I've got heads here, Norman.
You promised you'd do the show.
You do it.
So how's Norman?
Jesus...
I don't know. Probably not.
Jill's really great, isn't she?
I'm sure.
-- Well no. It never came up.
You going to tell him?
No, thanks.
Where do you want to do this?
Well, what do you think?
I'd cut it...
You would?
Yeah, I think so...
You don't seem very sure.
Jill's coming with us.
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
Whew.
What's wrong?
Not too much, don't cut too much.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
No.
And?
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
George... how about Felicia?
What?
Did I what?
You know what I'm talking about.
You did, I know you did.
One of my few virtues is discretion.
Yeah, baby...
No! Don't! Please!
It'll ruin everything.
I know... you don't know, I know.
Sit down.
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...
-- what guy?
-- this guy with Jill.
-- you are.
-- gee...
I don't know what gets into me.
No you didn't.
You don't think so? I do.
That sounds like me.
Sammy's?
He still having parties?
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
Am I entertaining you?
-- where'd you go?
-- oh I thought you were --
-- what?
-- very nice, very nice.
Mmmm --
-- ass and legs --
Look who's talking.
Me?
What's wrong?
-- we're kidding ourselves.
-- good afternoon --
Why?
Where are you going?
Please, we'll have to talk later --
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
-- It's Malone's.
Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me.
So I'm saying it...
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know... Jackie?
What for?
No, man.
-- Right after I sprayed her?
Wanda...
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
Yeah!
Wash her.
-- White ladies?
Otis is dead.
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
-- please, please forgive me...
-- you know better...
-- why did you come in today?
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
-- how did you get here?
-- took a bus.
Jackie Shawn.
-- yeah, this is --
Not yet.
That's too bad.
I have to see you.
Hi, George.
There were some shots.
What're you talking about?
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
Where?
Who?
I just... who what?
George --
Keep moving --
Now, George --
How are you, baby?
Fine. How are you?
What about me?
You're different.
I am?
You're great.
I am?
Yeah.
Do you really mean that?
Yeah, baby.
Will we live together?
Maybe you don't even like children.
Of course I like children.
You've never even been around one.
Yeah.
Okay...  Night, baby.
George?
George.
Jill, say hello to Felicia.
Could I talk to you for a second?
Hey, I'm, you know --
Go where?
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
Okay.
Yeah, baby.
About what?
Whether or not I'm going.
Going where?
What do you want?
They didn't offer you the job yet.
I want your feelings about it.
When?
When I get off work.
When is that?
I'll call you.
When is that, George?
Neither do I, baby.
What?
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
Jill says nothing.
Where's your car?
Who?
Never mind. Where've you been?
What business meeting?
What does he direct besides traffic?
Television or movies?
-- go ahead.
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
Bullshit.
How come you took your own car?
I didn't want him meeting me here.
Well that's something.
You did fuck him, didn't you?
Didn't you, baby?
That was him.
-- and take this with you.
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
Obviously.
How many?
I just want to know, that's all.
Baby, don't do this --
-- please, baby --
-- no, it'll help me, really --
What? What? What? What? What?
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
I wish you'd go now.
George...
Did you?
Yeah, I know. Did you?
Did you?
Stop it.
Did you?
Yes, yes, I did.
What did you say?
George...
What did you say?
What're you here for?
-- A wash and set.
No.
No?
You need a cut.
But Mr. Norman said --
Well, yeah.
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
It's an unusual trade.
In a way. But...
When?
... she's very upset...
You look like you've had quite a work-out.
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
I know it, I know it.
I don't know what to...
Well anyway...
You live like a pig.
All night.
Well... who are those guys?
What do they look like?...
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Well, what?
Now wait a minute...
Sit down.
But...
I wanna hear about it.
I wanna hear about it.
What, do you think I planned it?
Did they have something against me?
Didn't they tell you?
Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
Why, why do you think that is?
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
Want a drink?
Have a drink.
I know.
What about Jackie?
What about her?
I mean, how did that happen?
Lester, it just happened.
She's nothing but a whore.
You really think so?
Yes I do.
What took you so long?
I... uh... I... uh... can't.
No.

No.
Awww --
I'll call you back.
Come on by.
I'll call you back...

Yeah.
I'm coming over.
I'll call you back.
Okay.
A soap?
A daytime soap opera.
And?
I was too old.
Well maybe I can get you something.
You do?
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
Is that right?
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
George is going to open a shop.
I am?
Who were you talking to?
Who do you think I was talking to?
Of course not.
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
What's that?
They get hair all over the place.
No.
Why not?
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Does she know about us?
Jesus, she's my best friend.
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
Hi, doll, what's wrong?
Jackie Shawn.
Hi, Leonard.
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
Poster-Kleiser.
That's right.
I'll call you.
I am? I mean why?
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
Well, he is.
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
Don't be silly.
You're really a love -- you sure?
-- No. No really.
Well, what is it, honey?
Nothing.
It must be something.
We don't think marriage is important.
But you have problems?
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
I'm exaggerating.
How much?
Jackie --
Well yes -- you know that about George.
I would say so, yes.
Honey?
Didn't you have any panties on?
-- He reached up and tore them.
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
Egypt?
That's right.
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
Oh. thank you.
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
Well he's not exactly a friend.
Is he an enemy?
I'm terribly sorry.
-- no.
Good for you.
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
George? Was he alone?
I don't think so.
That bastard.
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
Two weeks from tomorrow.
You're going?
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
-- what's the problem, honey?
-- I'll get in the back --
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
Jill.
-- yes, Jill.
Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
Thank you.
You seem disappointed.
No... how long did you say?
No, it's not that...
Do you have children?
No.
Are you married?
No!
We'll let you know tomorrow.
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
Have they sat down?
No of course not.
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
Dad?
Yes?
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
You mean they ate each other up?
How's it going, Doc?
Are you having a good time?
I am, Dad.  Dad?
Yes.
No.  I'm just a little tired.
Then why don't you go to sleep?
Dad?
Yes?
Dad?
No, Dad.
Are you sure?
Yes, Dad.
You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?
Why don't you want to talk about it?
I'm not supposed to.
Tony.
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
I don't know.
Maybe he showed me something.
What about Room 237?
Room 237?
No I ain't.
Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's so pretty.
Mom?
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
Red Rum.
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Red Rum.
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
Mommy...
Danny, come here!
Mommy... Mommy...!
Mommy!
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
Talking to Tony.
Is Tony one of your animals?
No.
Why not?
Because he hides.
Where does he go?
Do I have to?
Please...
Oh I wouldn't think of it.
Well how can I repay you?
Grady?
Yes, sir.
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
No.
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Who?
A nigger.
A nigger!
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
Glad to meet you, Winifred.
I'm a Wendy.
Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
No, we don't mind.
Bill, how do you do?
Pleased to meet you.
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
How's my credit in this joint anyway?
Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd.  Thanks.
Hi Lloyd.  I've been away.  Now I'm back.
It's good to see you.
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
Hi, babe.
Perfect for a child.
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.
What time is it?
Any ideas yet?
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
Did you find anything?
Yes, I did.
And you didn't see anything at all?
He's still asleep.
Somebody did that to him.
Get him out of here?
Jack!
I...
As soon as possible.
Of course I am.
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me,
Wendy!
Stay away from me!
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay away from me!  Please...
Stop swinging the bat.
Stay away from me.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Stop it!
Stay... stay away!
Stay away from me.
Give me the bat.
Jack, stay away from me!
Stop swinging the bat.
Give me the bat.
Wendy...
Go away.
Give me the bat.
Go away.
I'll bring back a doctor.
I'm gonna go now.
Mr. Ullman?
I'm Jack Torrance.
Very nice to meet you.
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?
They'll love it.
shut in together over long periods of time.
No, my son's discovered the games room.
Royalty?
Thanks.
Fine.
What time does the plane leave?
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
Lowe's car-?
Blue. This blue.
Can I tell you kids something?
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
Yes. Go away.
Where's Mom?
Went shopping. Why?
Please, Uncle Al.
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
For getting a divorce?
There's something else scary.
I've been hearing noises in there.
What kind of noises?
Rattling. Rustling.
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
You all right, Marty?
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
You got a pilot's license, Marty?
Yeah... sure.
What is it?
A tracer. You'll like it.
Was it a prescription?
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
I told you!
There! You see!
Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
You're not going to let it go, are you?
I saw what I saw.
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
What you say?
BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
I think I hear it!
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
You know, I just might!
LET THY SPIRIT
You know what we're saying!
LET THY SPIRIT
He's... dreamy.  He's...
Yes, Mary?
SING!
Were you tempted?
SING!
And I'm tearful!
Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here?  At Sunday School?
And you listen to that?
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
How are you doing.
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
His ashes?
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
What?
Okay, Christy -- strip.
What did who say?
You are so damn sexy.
No... it's fine.
She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
Oh, girls.
Yes, Betty?
This prom is a real drag.
Oh-huh.
Oh my! 
What is it, Betty?
Look at that.  Get a gander.
Yes, Betty?
HE'S SO FINE.
Where did that come from?
Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
Just about.  Show me again.
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
That machine.
I know.  It's ancient.
What is it, Mary?
Hurry, Sister!
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
It's true -- I know her.
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
Shirelles.
Soprano or alto?
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
Wet behind the ears.
It'll be hell.
Hopeless I
Amateurs 2
Babies
She's a pro.
JUST SING!
Come on, we're late.
What?  What time is it?
What?
I... I brought you something.
Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
Three years.  Sister.
Three years.  A rookie.
Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
Mary Clarence!
Bobs
Experience!  Right?
I have to do this.  So I can become a nun.
I'm getting experience.
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
Mary Clarence!
Goddamn it!
What was all that?  Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
I don't want to mess anyone up...
WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART
Are you leaving us?
The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words?
Wait, this isn't the way.  Who are you?
Run!  Take off!
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
Mary Clarence!
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
Don't you know it!
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
What did He say?
Your name?
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
St. Anne's?
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
You were unhappy?
Sit down.
Miss Van Cartier.
What? 
It has come to pass.
Are you talking about me?
And all those like you.
What's a concubine?
But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
No problem.
The vow of obedience.
And the vow of chastity.
Silence?  No talking?  All day?
No food?
Is this all the food I get?
My what?
You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
And whom would you call?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
I got it.
I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
No.  No.
I was thinking Las Vegas.  Get some butts in those seats.
Out of the question.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
But... wait a minute...
Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
Oh?
You saved my life.
I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
And if I don't?
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
Okay -- no limo.
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
Really?  Lieutenant?
You mean -- worried about my testimony?
Me too.
Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
Vince knows you're here.
I can't go with you.
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
I think they'd understand.
What're you doing?
Hey, girls.
Really.
Where's who?
You won't even tell us?
We're looking for Mike.
But you didn't tell me!
A nun?
Vince -- is she... okay?
And if she runs?
He's so damn cocky.  This is different.
It's done?
Not... totally.
Well?
Right.
Get her!
Joey?
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
You didn't shoot!
Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry?
What's she doing?
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
It should be here any minute.
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
We've got to save her!
Sister Mary Patrick?
She shouldn't have come back.  She knew she was in danger.
Is this like your old convent?
He's not like other guys.
He's decent.
I'd rather sing than do anything!
It's better than ice cream.
But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.
Mary Clarence!  Sister!
We can't sing without her!  What should we do?
An... entertainer?
It's so beautiful...
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
Not a note.
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
Reverend Mother?
I lied.
I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
Where?
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
You must have missed your mark.
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
No bleeding.
We must be a curious sight to him.
He is a behemoth.
Bring Young Masbath here.
You need to sleep.
Bring him.
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
Stains of blood.
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
I will not allow it.  I will not!
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
Wallowing in sin and lust...
They need guidance.
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
Do you have these persons' wills?
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Hmm?  See them?
Maybe you should take this.
Damn... damn... damn...
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
I shall, gladly.
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
What is the common thread between these victims?
Where are we going?
Out there.  What do you see?
The Western Woods.
Are you familiar with magnets?
What kind of nuts?
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
Father said witches live there.
What is it?
Listen.
We are leaving.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
What is it?
We should go.
Man or woman?
All I saw was their lantern.
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
Baltus Van Tassel.
Did your father take a loan?
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
I was getting worried.  Who was it?
Lady Van Tassel.
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 
Climb up!
Lady Van Tassel...
What can we do?
What now?
How are you?
Forgive me, I didn't know.
Other people?
Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
These scars.  How did you get them?
Thank you.  No.  Here...
I insist that you have it.
People have put their trust in you.
Why would you do such a thing?
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
And this gives worth to butchery?
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
To avenge his father, and the others.
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
No, but... why do you ask that?
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
It is only me.
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
I apologize if I worried you.
Blood.
What are you doing?
The skull is gone.
What... what are you doing... ?
What did he say, Katrina?
What would you have me believe?
If you think I am behind this, say it.
Where are we going?
The church.
What was that?
Ichabod...
I... I can't do this.
Returning to the Western Woods?
Yes, actually.
No.  She has gone out.
It appears well.  It has already clotted.
Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
I know you saw me.
You cannot kill what is already dead.
Let her go!
Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...
There was not much blood, was there?
What did you say?
You are from the Hollow?
What... what are you doing?
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
He rides tonight.
Go home.
She did not do it... please listen...
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
She has confessed.
I can go. You don't have to. You don't never go.
They say you're a whiz on fixin' lawn mowers and things.
I like them french-fried potaters.
Yeah, they's good all right.
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
How 'bout you, Jerry.
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
Can I see him?
Can I help you?
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
Well, what did you want?
You have any biscuits for sale?
Did you decide, sir?
What you got that's good to eat?
Well, I guess it's all good.
What do you like to eat here?
French-fried potaters.
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
About a half a mile I think it is.
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
You know what, by God?
How'd your baptizin' go?
He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.
Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!
Sure, I guess.
I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.
Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.
What's all them books?
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.
What's you last name?
Childers.
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
Don't you live somewhere?
They let you out?
Yeah.
Are you well?
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
You told me to come by.
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
Who did you kill?
Two people.
Were they bad people?
I thought they was.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
I like the way you talk.
Yeah.
That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
Hit was right thoughty of her.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
They ort to. You're a good boy.
What do you mean?
Pull on your works. Your privates.
Why not? It died?
Yeah.
It was alive?
A boy or girl?
A little ol' boy.
It was still alive when you buried it?
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
You will? For sure?
You don't want to give away all your books.
Yes sir.
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.
How come Karl won't eat here with us?
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
I know he does.
Mama?
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.
You walk fast, don't you?
A blister shore can hurt.
I'm ye boy.
I ain't got no boy.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
You better go get your things.
You better go get 'em.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
Karl, you up?
Do they know about you?
My history.
You scared me.
I didn't aim to.
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
Ma'am?
It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
What brings you back?
What's that you say?
Why are you here now?
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
Do you have family here?
That boy wants me to.
Did you knock on the door yet?
Naw, I ain't.
How long have you been standing here?
I done et just a little bit ago.
I reckon not.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
Let's just go, Marsha.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
And what are you, his chaperone?
Will that be cash or charge?
So your mother grew up in Shanghai?
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
That's the subject of my last chapter.
Jesus, what happened to you?
I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
And what about for you?
Huh?
What about for you?
For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
Do me a favor, will you?
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
Are you closed?
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
Yeah, I did.
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
I've never seen anything like it.
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
He's crazy.
No, he's not. You are.
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
Hey, man, how's it going?
Two, right?
Uh, better make it one.
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
So. Are we ready?
Ready. Any time you are.
She probably died.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
And what's that supposed to mean?
She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
Bully for you.
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
And you're giving it to me?
It's all yours, baby.
For keeps?
There's just one thing I want to know.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
What is this, some kind of joke?
Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
And why the hell would you give me money?
How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
It'll never be finished.
Sure, Auggie, I got it.  The store's closed.  And when do I tell them it's open?
Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
Is your name Paul Benjamin?
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
I just want to know where he is.
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
And you told your nephew about it?
You going to sit here all day?
I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis.
Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
Hi there, little brother.
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
Yeah? Who is it?
Well?
Well what?
Aren't you going to say anything?
What do you want me to say?
Baby? And what baby is that?
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
So what's the time?
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
I owe you something.
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
East Seventy-fourth Street.
In Manhattan?
That's where the what comes in.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
Drawing's a good thing.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
What time is it?
Eight-thirty.
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
Are you going to be all right?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
Appreciation for what?
I don't know. For helping me out.
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
What time did you get to bed last night?
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
I don't know.
Is it yours?
Yeah, it might be.
So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.
Yeah, I picked it up.
And started to run.
And started to run.
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
Well?
Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?
Medium rare, please.
Fries?
Yes, please.
Lettuce and tomato?
Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?
Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
I don't know.
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
Is that your third question?
It is.
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
Question withdrawn, you may step down.
You're implying th...
The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
I can just feel my spirits soar.
I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her.
Did you write that column?
I did.  But the jury won't s...
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
<u>Were</u> you, sir?  Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it.
My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?
You have the night watch?  On the radio.
How long you have this detail?
I did.  Boy.
Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
Here now, what are you fixin' to do?
You gonna climb that with one arm?
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.
That's when he fell.
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
We don't let go, you s...
You always run with the well open?
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
You gaff with the <u>hook</u> end. Blood's on the butt.  Where your hand goes.
You must think I like losing.
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.
Does it now?
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
No spare.
How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
Is it possible?
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
Are you absol...
He had no reason to.
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques...
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Are these your bags?
Yes.  And that one, too.
Okay, doll.
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
Wanna see my driver's license?
Which of you dolls is Daphne?
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
Thank you ever so.
You're welcome.
Upsy-daisy.
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
Okay. 
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.
You're right, Joe.
No we're not.
Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?
Hey, Joe!
I told you - it's a sure thing.
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
I thought you weren't talking to me.
Yeah - where were you?
With you.
Nellie told us about it.
All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
I think they got me.
They got the bull-fiddle.
Where are we running, Joe?
The police?  We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo.  Wabash 1098.
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.
My name is Josephine.
Not there - that's the emergency brake.
Done what?
Tore off one of my chests.
You'd better go fix it.
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
Steady, boy.  Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
Good night, Daphne.
What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
What happened?
I got pinched in the elevator.
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
You know - the old shell game.
Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
And where's he going to be?
With ME?
That's right.
Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.
You can both go take a flying jump.
Come on, you can do better than that. Give him teeth - the whole personality.
Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
What are you doing with my flowers?
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
I'm engaged.
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
I am.
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
You think he's too old for me?
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
Jerry - there's another problem.
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
Like when?
Like right after the ceremony.
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
That's some nerve!
Joe -
Shut up and keep packing.
Sugar?
Get me Room 414.
Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
All right - so what do we do now?
What'll I tell him?
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
It's all fixed!  Osgood is meeting us on the pier -
OH!
Are my seams straight?
I'll say.
Good night, Sugar.
Good night, honey.
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
If there's anything I can do for you -
And that's one of them.
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
Stay as long as you'd like.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
Interesting.
Anything wrong?
That's ridiculous.
And your head is hot.
That's ridiculous.
And you've got cold feet.
What did you say?
I'm a very sick girl.
I'm not that sick.
You all right?
I'm fine.
How's the bottle?
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
What's the surprise?
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
We better have a drink first.
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
Who needs vermouth?
And bring the cocktail shaker.
Not you, Sugar.
I'll carry the instruments.
See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?
What do you think you're doing?
You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.
Well, I'll be - !   How about that guy?
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
We don't have to run.
I guess she's not in here.
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.
No!
How did you get that bracelet?
You like it?
Where did you girls play before?
How did those holes get there?
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
Yes.  For a whole year.
I was it.
It's about the Florida job.
What's wrong with us?
We could pass for that.
- you got to be blonde -
We could dye our hair.
- and you got to be girls.
Help yourself.
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
Me too.  Bye now.
Let me carry one of the instruments.
Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
Most of the time I slap it.
You must be quite a girl.
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
This is where I get off.
Please.  It won't happen again.
Who?
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
Daphne...
Yes, Osgood?
You're leading again.
Pleased to meet you.
Another bridesmaid?
I forgive you.
And I can never have children.
We'll adopt some.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?
To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
I don't like no witnesses.
We won't breathe a word.
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
Why?
And you'll be in all evening?
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
It's not the backs that worry me.
No, we couldn't!
Well, here we are.
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
Where did he conduct?
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
Rough?
I'll say.
That so?
Every time!
You know - I play tenor sax.
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
What's happened?
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
Want to switch berths with me?
Would you mind terribly?
Thanks, honey.
Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
What makes you so sure?
Wait a minute, Daphne.  You haven't got a bathing suit.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
You're not hurt, are you?
I don't think so.
I wish you'd make sure.
Thank you.
Who are you?
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Not very likely.
Not at all.
No, my flag steward.
I'm not interested at all.
Well, I'm not.
How's the stock market?
Could be.  Do you play the market?
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
- Inauguration balls -
- opening of the Opera -
- riding to hounds -
Well, I guess I'd better go -
It's been delightful meeting you both.
The most wonderful thing happened -
What?
Guess!
I just got this motorboat - it's an experimental model.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
What is it?
I don't mind if I do.
Look at all that silverware.
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
What's on Thursdays?
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
They just sort of leave me cold.
Have you tried?
See?  Nothing.
Nothing at all?
Complete washout.
What happened?
I don't want to bore you.
Is that anything?
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
Would you do me a favor?
It's like smoking without inhaling.
I think you're on the right track.
Mineral baths - now really!
Good night.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.
Did you have a nice time?
Really?
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
Good evening, sir.
What'll it be, sir?
Who's going to raid a funeral?
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
We got different information.
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
What's his first name?  And where does he live?
Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
I cut myself shaving.
You shave with your spats on?
All right, Charlie - this the joint?
Yes, sir.
And who runs it?
I already told you.
Refresh my memory.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
What for?
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
Theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Perfect. All ginny.
Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--
I should get going.
Are you sure youre okay?
Hey.
You know what? Im not having this conversation right now.
What for?
Still--
If Ed ever found out....
Does Kat know?
Jeffrey told her last night.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now shes getting married.
Um, just about everyone.
I thought you said you were crap.
You heading to the train station?
Whats his problem?
Theres something about him thats just a bit odd.
Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
Thats when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
I didnt deserve her back then.
Nothing.
Hey.
Ah, a philosopher.
Shrink, actually.
Crikey.
What?
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
Seeing you again....
So, tell me, hows unmarried life?
Kat, we must talk. This guy, theres something not quite right.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Bollocks, Im sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
Hi. Hey.
What color are my shoes?
Mission accomplished.
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
I dont know.
What does your gut say?
No, count it, anyway.
Why?
Who are they?
What?
What is?
You stand on your tiptoes.
A weekend?
How did you know that was me?
I have a friend at the magazine.
Yes.
I guess so.
I swear. I dont have a signature move.
Its hard to explain.
Dont they have a limit at those machines?
And what if I didnt want you to...to do that to me?
Oh, cut the crap!
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
So, whyd you say yes to me?
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
Yeah. You?
Fourteen and hes hoodwinked by a an erector set?
And thats when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
What?! No, no. You cant--
Whats he do anyway?
Oh, no. He told you.
You knew?
Give it back? Are you nuts?
You want I nut him in the boat?
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
You want me to let him in?
Dad!
Hi, kiddo.
So whyd you let him go?
Not yet...
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?
I always wondered what happened with us.
Is he here in Borderdale?
Uh huh...
Here it is, right here.
That's where we come from first?
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
Well, how did you like the class, David?
Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
Yes, Miss Johnson...
No, Miss Johnson...
Can you swim?
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...

You would do that, wouldn't you?
It's cold, Daddy!
It was too dark, Daddy.
He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.
David Lee...
I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none.
Well, looka here...
Hi, Daddy...
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
We didn't find Sounder yet.
Son, that was some trip you went on...
Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
Goodnight, Daddy...
Mornin', son...
Where's everybody?
They gone to the field...
Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.
You know somethin', Daddy?
What's that, son?
What's your daddy's name?
Mister, can you visit anybody here?
When's that?
Miss Boatwright --
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.
David!
What's in there, David!?
He eats all right -- his throat ain't scarred.
I don't look like no possum!
I guess I'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be.
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
That's right!
Ready to go, Mama!
You got two shirts on?
Who's winning, Mama?
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
Who is they?
Can I go when the holiday comes?
Any sign of Sounder?
What is it, David Lee?
Can I go day after tomorrow?
Good night, Mama...
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
What's that you carryin'?
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
Who's Miss Johnson?
So when I left, she gave me these books.
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
What's wrong with him, David?
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
What's wrong, Nathan?
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.
It's about the Three Musketeers.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
Would you like to have a cool drink, David?
You know where my father is, don't you, Miss Boatwright?
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
Come, I'll take you home.
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
Don't take all day at that table, David Lee.
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
Is he gon' be gone long?
Mama, what was we laughin' for?
Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta see.
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.
Hi ya, Rebecca...
Mornin'...
You ready to eat?
Well, let's get to work!
Is there something I can do to help you?
I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
What...
Behold my glory.
What... are you?
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
Montana.

Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.
Hello, Conan!
Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.
Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!

Evening.
It can't be.
Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
Oh, thank you.
Magnificent, magnificent.
Well I appreciate that.
Of course, of course...
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
And what are they doing now, Mac?
On channel 10?
Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.
What did you say to me?
All too well, captain.
No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?
It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
You want to go back to shuttle work?
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
I think I can handle it.
Bridge!  Can anyone hear me?!
If anyone can hear me please respond!
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.
Barnes?
It's time we lock coordinates.
So, what are we waiting for?
Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
Is that clear?
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
Look at this...Jesus.
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
What's the use...we're gonna die...
We're going to die.
It's getting hard to breathe...
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
What are we going to do?
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
OK...it's open.
Seen one like it before?
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
He certainly is polite.
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
I don't know what we're facing.
Are you ready?
Yeah.  We did it.
You're ready for the real thing?
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
Taylor?
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.
Do you want some advice?
Dawn!  Dawn!
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
Take this flare.
I'm not going with you.
Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
Dawn.  Come in.
I'm in the bridge.
He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.
I'm about to blow the wall.
Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!
I'll do my best.
So what's going to happen to you?
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
Hopefully sooner than later.
Sooner than later.
What the hell are you doing?
We have room!  Let's go!
What do you mean?  What happened!
I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.
Will you marry me?
What is it?!
I'm fine.
Congratulations on your...recent award.
Is there anything I can help you with?
Carlo!
I'm going back for Taylor!
I'm homesick.
Oh no...I think there's carrots in here...
Well now what are we gonna do!
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
What the hell is that?
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
How is it looking, Mac?
Is it safe for human transport?
You're not from around here, are you?
I'm looking for a man.
What kind of man?
Can I get you something for the road?
You have orange whips?
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Yeah, basement bingo.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
Hey, you still here?
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.
La da da dalala...
You know, Elvis bowled.
How do you turn this thing off?
Think he bought it?
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
You look like you're something on the lanes.
Theo's bowled on the tour.
Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
Buzz Fazeli.
I'm not on the tour this year.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
They suspended me for 100 years.
Where'd you get this ball?
Who gave it to you?
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
I got a right. You're my father.
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
What's it look like to you?
I'm your blood.
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
Theo, I want you to get out of this town.
You got a better offer?
No...
We ain't married no more.
The whole world thinks you're underground.
So, eh, you never saw me. Right?
I never saw you.
He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
Hello?
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
Don't tell me, John.
Cool!
I don't like to talk about it.
Knock-knock.
Who's there!
You shouldn't touch her.
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.
Who's there?
I have someone for you to play with Junior.
Someone wants to play with me?
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
Why would you help me?
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
Fantastic! What talent.
Don't go near the bowling alley.
Hello, Mr.Kastle.
I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.
Grasp firmly. Then what?
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
Get that outta your mouth!
He's not here.
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
He's my father, Millie.
Where can I find him?
What's your specialty?
How do you want it?  The eggs.
Uh...over easy.
Do those two work for your dad or mine?
I came here to have a word with your dad.
Kinda tough on the butt.
Everything has it's drawbacks.
Where did your brother escape from?
The mental hospital.
Whoa.
Mind if I cut in?
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
Can I ask you something personal?
I'd rather you didn't.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Not while I'm in training.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No. Do You?
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
So, what about you?
Do I want you?
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
No, I'm fascinated.
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
Well, that was plan A.
What's plan B?
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
What's plan C?
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
More than you could afford.
Come on, bargain with me.
Then it's true, isn't it? About...
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
Why should I help that old fuck.
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
Nothing.
I can't tell you, Theo.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
How do you get this thing down?
You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?
He's dead Sheila.
I feel sick.
You should.
Are you sure he's dead?
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
You don't get two chances with Junior.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
What about plan C?
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
Sez you!
Very professional.
I am a professional man.
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!
Tell your little pal to let go.
Very good, busyboy.
Your time is up, busyboy.
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
... Your civil rights have been overridden!
Open it, Captain!
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
They're warm.  I can feel the heat on my legs.
Fletcher, get away from there...
It's burning...
Get out of there!
I can't see...
Fletcher!  Now!
There's heat coming the door.
Back away then.
Wait a minute --
I said back away.
Hold on --
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
They told me about sixty hours.
Nobody move.
But she's --
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
Direction's east coming!
What if it attacks?
Fifty yards and closing.
What was that?
Increase positive pressure!
Don't do it, Norman!
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?
Don't do it!
Norman, please!  Don't!
Thank you, Colonel.
Captain.
What have you been told so far?
Anything else?
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
From what?  What's with all the security?
We're moving fast considering the storm.
How deep is he?
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
-- Wait a second --
Hold on --
Extraordinary, isn't it?
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
What is it, Norman?
Picked up something?  What is it?
Maybe we shouldn't.
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
I don't know.  That's the point.
Harry's missing.
What do you mean, he's missing?
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
How drastic?
You don't want to know.
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
Wait a second --
-- and then brought her down here --
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
Going active.
What the hell?  It shut us down.
Can you open that panel?
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
I'm getting no sub reading, sir.
Any sign of Harry?
Nothing, sir.
Yes, sir.
Well, where the fuck is he?
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
They've left, keep watching!
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
How much damage?
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
I did.
Ted?  Captain?
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
So how do we get it open?
Gimme a report, I want --
Ladies and Gentlemen...
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
What's the message?
I have to tell you.  It's strange.
Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant.
With an "o".  Harold with an "o".
I'd also like it noted --
Ted, get her away from the door.
Look at this.
Some sort of lead or something.
What's wrong?
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
How can he be missing?
They switched us over.
To what?
She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.
From the sphere?
I want a name.  A real name.  This thing's full name, rank and serial number.
What is that?
What was Edmunds doing outside?
Resetting the sub.
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
Because when we get down there --
Wait -- down where?
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
Where'd this come from?
My gosh, Norman.
Yeah, it was awful.
Wait a minute.
What?  Why...
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
Norman.
What are they?
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
Where did you get this?
In Edmunds' things.
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
What?
Beth --
You did, didn't you?
Don't do this.
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Forget the sub.
Don't bother me, Norman.
You, me and Harry?
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
Maybe you should go.  To the sub.
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
In case you die, too?
I don't trust Harry to do it.
I would.  But my suit --
You fixed my suit?
You don't trust me?
What's the matter?
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
Still clear?
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
You get it straightened out?
The refridgerator.
That wasn't in there before.
We must've had it delivered then.
Wait a second --
None of this was here before.
You think?
You don't believe me.
He translated it wrong.
Looks like some sort of code.
Diphenyl parlene.
Something for burns.
Valdomet.
Ulcers.
Sintag.
Nothing about drowsiness.
Tarazine?
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Riordan?
Antihistamine.  For bites.
Antibiotic.
Parasolutrine?
How do you spell it?
P-a-r-a-s-o...
It's a soporific.
What's that?
Causes sleep.
How long does it last?
I'll just boost the doses.
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
How fast does it take effect?
To be on the safe side.  I mean --
You ever given an injection before.
I'm sorry.
For what?
Where are you?
The sphere looks different.
What's wrong, Norman?
I'm feeling better.
It's getting cold.
You think I'd really drink that?
How do you feel about snakes?
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
You tell me.
Don't you?
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
No, he isn't.
He can't manifest.
Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.
C'mon -- what?
That's when you went in the sphere.
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
Don't, Beth.
But I have to, Norman.
I promise --
Don't, Beth.  Please.
Don't fuck with me, Beth.
Beth?
You can't stop it, Norman.  You can't fight me.
I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
C'mon --
What?
You hear that?
Hear what?
Get away from me!
Beth --
No.  I don't think so.
Norman?  Where's Norman?
He doesn't wait for an answer.
For who?  The fish?
Then what is it?
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
What?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Like what?  I'm not --
You're staring at me.
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
We can refuse to talk.
How are you feeling, Norman?
What?
You holding up alright?
Fine.  I'm fine.
Don't be defensive.
I'm not being defensive.
You sound defensive.
Go ahead.  Ladies first.
C'mon.
C'mon, Norman.
Nice work, Norman.
To what?
This answers one of our questions.
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
I can't believe that, Harry.
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
No.  I didn't say that.
What noise?
Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
What are you still doing here?
You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
You don't understand about the sphere.
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
Did I?
Harry?
Norman, where are you?
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
What happened to her?
What do you mean?  She's not here?
When I woke up, nobody was here.
Her suit's gone.
Beth left?
She's cracking, Norman.
Wisconsin's your answer.
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
How do we decode it?
The three of us.
What is it?
It's the squid!  Stop it!
Fine.
I can't reach her.
Push her, c'mon.
Hold on.
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
C'mon, Norman!
I'm trying to keep balance with --
Her legs are in the way.
No idea.
Well, press something!
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
There is one possibility.
She told me what you said, Norman.
What is it, Harry?
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
English?
You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.
All the facts you need are right in front of you.
Do you?
If it is an alien spacecraft --
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Please.  It must have flown here --
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
What'd you say?
Does this mean what I think it means?
How are the others?
The others, sir?
Beth and Harry?
Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?
No, they didn't say --
You mean they haven't told you yet?
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
What report?
Huh?
What report?
You mean you don't know?
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
He wasn't feeling well.
Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
I don't see anything.
Squint harder.
Please, Ted.
Try this one.
Well, he's polite.
What was it?
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
What kind of a crash was it?
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
What?
Was it a military crash?
I think there are some things we should talk about.
Fear is their greatest weapon.
We'll be back before you are, old man.
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.
I know that.
You saw through me?
You could put it that way.
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
What's wrong?  What's happening?
What is it?
I can't see!  How can I fight?
Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
Of course, where you been kid?
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
You're Starkiller?
Yes, sir.
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.
Yes, sir, but I can get him...
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
We don't get many visitors.  Let's take a look at it.
Here come six more... grid two!
Where are you taking us now anyway?
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.
Who's the pilot?
I found it... It's just not there.
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
Why didn't you say so before.
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
I think she's going to be all right.
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
We'll send a squad up.
No need, everything's under control.
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
See Threepio... do you copy?
Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...
What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
Something... I've got...you don't.
You rich kids... are all the same !
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
It's what I deserve.
No, this hurts.
Mobile Infantery rules !
Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?
Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
He was our teacher... He was great.
Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
What's the hurry ?
Yeah, but I want Carmen.
Don't think about it... go on instinct.
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
I don't believe it !
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
So what are you doing later ?
I'm all ears.
Or...?
They revoke our flight status.
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said...
Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
WHERE IS IT ?
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
Funny...
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
Carmen...?
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
Where are you going ?
How do you feel about him now ?
I don't know, Zander.
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
Zander, what are you doing ?
Good for you.
She's flying starships !
35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
You can't walk me home.
Carl can wait.
Isn't it great to be in love ?
How do I know if this is love ?
Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
None at all... We won.
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
Zander is going for pilot, too.
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
I can't help it.
He's nothing like you.
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
Who cares ?
I love you, Carmen.
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
You talk to Carl ?
I'm gonna miss you.
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
I thought you were KIA, Johnny...
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
Take care, wilya Johnny ?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
Sure.
Uh, look, Diz...
Guess you gotta go.
Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
No thanks, Diz.
Man, they're defended... no way in.
Flip six, three hole.
Cover me.
It stinks, you goin.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
Way to go, amigo !
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
You used to dance...
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
Hey, Diz...
Diz, see what you can do.
What frequency ?
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
Oh, my, what's that ?
Looks like rain.
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
Sir, thank you, sir !
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Are your parents currently citizens ?
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
Let's go.
Can you walk ?
How bad are you, pal ?
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
Mister Rasczak ?
Kill the bitch.
Yes, sir !
What's that look like to you, Rico ?
Sergeant, secure the boat !
AAAAAAAAAAAA !
Who is...'V'ger'...?
V'ger is that which programmed me.
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
The Creator is that which created V'ger.
Who is V'ger?
The examination is a normal function.
<U>Why</U>?!
The Creator has not answered.
Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?
They have repressed the Creator.
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
Our data is being prepared.
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
Departure angle on viewer.
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
-- You, personally, are assuming command?
We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
Then you acted properly, of course.
You saved the ship.
I'm aware of that, sir.
Permission to speak freely, sir?
If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
<U>Computer off</U>!
It's taken control of the computer...!
Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us; they could have done that outside.
They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.
Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
Forward motion, Captain...!
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. 
Hello, Ilia.
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
'Commander' Decker?
Time to impact...?
Mr. Spock?
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
Hold station.
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
Hold station...!
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
I still contain fragments of my human half.
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
Not for us?
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
We're ready, sir.
Dock control reports ready, sir.
Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming...
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
Cal...
Mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.
I'll be there.
You bringing your new friend?
He have any special dietary requirements...?
He'll eat potroast and like it.
Go you Huskies?
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
Who?
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
What's it called?
I quit.
I quit the movie.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You like my play.
Yes.
Why?
Could you tell me when's the next train?
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
But why the dalmation?
You get what you pay for.
That's true.  You grow up here?
Yes...
No, no, I see...
That: in an act of...
I understand...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
And likewise.
I live there.
I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might...
What are you doing?  I love your script.
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
You'd know better'n me.
What I need to <u>say</u>...
<u>Yes</u>...
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
Me?
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
I thought you had Play Practice.
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
What happened?
Cast stood me up.
What are you doing down there?
...lost the screw...
You like kids?
Never saw the point of 'em.
Paperclip?
Fix my glasses.
Great.  Who is it...?
Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside.
Oh, God...
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
It's for your finger.
Thank you.
The other side.
Later on.
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
You can do it.
Because I'd met someone else.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
You believe that?
So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
I used to go out with a politician.
Sure did.
Yes.
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
What's the scene...
It used to be the Old Mill.
Ah.  Ah.  Ah...
...yes.
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
Hi.
Hi.
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
How's your star?
Gosh, you look nice.
What would you do with it, the printshop...
Press still works.
It does?
Best way I know to get ink on your hands.
That's something a man could do...?
Good morning.
Sleep well?
Yeah, you?
Now you're talking...
...and we could get up every morning...
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
Not without a rolltop desk.
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
What is it all about?
But it'll stop the movie.
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
What are you going to do?
If I go to jail...?
Morning, darling.
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
Water or mineral deposits.
We on for tomorrow night?
After Drama Group.
And I might have something important to tell you...
What is it, a surprise?
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...
What, what what are you doing here?
What are they offering?
Ten thousand dollars.
That's so beautiful...
Hi!
We had a date.
We did...?
Where have you been...
Who is this person that you've found?
He works on the movie.
No.  Don't tell me that.
Maude, this <u>man</u> wrote this <u>play</u>!
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
What courthouse?
Courthouse back in town.
Town ain't got no courthouse.
Well, where do they hold court?
They're holding it for ransom.
It'll hurt the box office.
He's on the ph...
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
...they run on water.
How big is this horse?
Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill?  Hey, Bob.
That's right.
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
They think it's your First Wife...
Then she wasn't in the car.  <u>Say</u> it.
...upset and impressionable...  Get me the Mayor...
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
What'll I do for fun?
Whyn't you learn your lines?
Bobby, don't say anything.
I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you...
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
I loved it...he...
Isn't he...
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you like some?
I don't eat vegetables.
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
Sure, what have you got?
What do you drink?
Bourbon and Milk.
How old are you?
Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.
Are you all right...?
I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion <u>Picture</u>.
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Tell it with...
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
She's a...
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
What...
Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don't need...
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
<u>Bobby</u>...
How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
I'm very sorry to...
Of course he...
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
It's night.
Aren't you ever in school?
There's other things to be learned.
Izzat so?
The Mayor's outside.
What's his name?
Nobody touched me, I was at home.
Who is it raped you?
Nobody.
No.
I wasn't in the car.
Get him on the phone.
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
You have no right to...
Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
I love Jewish men.
Why?
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
I like you, too.
But not that <u>way</u>...
But we...
You have to hide.
Who is that...?
Oh.
Will you help me out...?
Claire, when did you...
I just...
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
What...?
I can't do it, Walt.
I know that...
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
I...I...
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
Wally...
...yes...
...wants a piece...
Yes.
And you know what...?
We, we have to give it.
Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
I...
An artist of your caliber...
I know...
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
...yes...
Hello.
...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
You show Claire these sketches?
Yes.
Did she throw up?
I can't tell.
Why not?
Kiss my ass.
What?
Who got their heads cut?
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
You said <u>three</u>...?
Where you off to?
I, uh...I'm leaving.
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
Main Street.
I have to talk to you.
Arrest him.
What is the...?
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
He told you that...
He didn't have to tell...
I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
Later for you, pal.
What's in the case?
I'm looking for the writer.
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
My wife's going to have a baby.
How about that.
Mmmm.  You have children?
Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
He should be put in jail.
You should.
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
Who's White...?
The writer.
He saw the girl in the car...
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
We're out of money.
I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
I can only write on a manual.
Grace...
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
I want to make a good film.
What's the...
I can't.
I'm gonna nail it.
Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
I'm out.
I don't getcha.
The girl was in the car.
I treated you like a son or nephew.
It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
The girl was in the car.
You can't write it?
What did you say to them...?
I didn't say anything to them.
How do you know you saw it?
I don't know.
I don't...
You didn't see it...
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
You cool the broad out?
I left that for you.
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
How was your flight?
Did you bring Bob's weights?
They're coming Fedex...
<u>Stop</u>...
I don't got the money.
Pay her off.
We don't have the money.
<u>Find</u> it.
If you do the product placement...
We got the permit.
Is that one hell of a kid?
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
He's got a gift for fiction.
She wasn't in...you were al...
There's no witnesses...
The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...
...we don't have thirteen at table...
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
I've got two days to get this house...
Don't you <u>touch</u> that...I want them gone.
I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
I want them thrown in jail.
Well, you know, Walt, I just wanted to say that anything I could do...
I <u>am</u> the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...
You hear that?
She coulda done better than him.
"Assembly of Death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
You think so?
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
Ain't no second chances in life.
Where are we?
We have to lose the window.
We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?
But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;
Ben!  What's wrong?
I'd rather be with Mommy.
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
It just slipped out.
Well, not exactly s...
Scream.
...why do you think?
So why are you asking me?
What are you gonna talk about?
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
Then why are you putting on mascara?
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
That happens.  To families.
Wow.  Who's that for?
Like a big sister.
I can't hear you.
I said...
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
Not with my mouth open.
This'll work, huh?
Annabelle...wake up honey...
Mom?  What's wrong?
I don't want to say goodbye.
I'll miss you so much.
I'm sorry, okay?  Let's not fi...
This is my daddy's house --
This is my house too!
The timing was off -- I need this light.
C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...
She still packing for her trip?
Why don't you say hello?
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That doesn't bother me.
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
Oh, baby, I'm so sor...
Not use my words, please!
Ice cold water.
There you are!
Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!
You do NOT run out on your moth...
You know, this horse smells really bad.
...your hating me.
No.
You touched it.
Then have a donut --
No.
Excuse me --
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
Are you <u>real</u> mad?
...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!
IS THAT YOU?
I have lava.
Poof!  You're happy now.
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Mommy?
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
That I do.  Always will.
ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!
No.
Mommy's sick, guys.
You have the WORST flu since...
So you're okay.
No!  I have to get there.
Where Ben?
Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
Okay.  These are good.
Find the bird cage?
Rache says it's from you.
But you can still see him.
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
You say that like I don't know that.
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
That's necessary, huh?
You're making a <u>career</u> decision here, I would <u>strongly</u> sugg...
Planning on getting --
Are you here?
I'm here.
Something's up wi...
Rachel's not half my age.
We're not discussing your age.
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
I'm worried.
Easy enough.
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
Called him.  We set an ap...
I'm afraid she's going to walk.
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
We're going to win this.
What happens next?
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
We don't have any coffee.
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
Get out!
But it's not on the schedule!
Machines do not EAT message.
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
So why did y...
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
I'm sorry, I just...
She was angry at herself.
Jackie?
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
Look, you've never liked me...
Nobody likes a snoop.
Did I hear the word...
I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.
You bet you are.
How the hell would you know?
I don't, but...
They came out of my <u>body</u>!
Okay, I'm undeserving.
And you said...?
So.  Hopeful.
I really look like shit.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
The primo stuff is great for pain.
He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
It's just not the right time t...
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
My advice to you?  Don't die.
Is that what he told you?
Are we.
Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
You're lying.
With good reason.  They fucking worship you as it is.
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
You're the hip and fresh.
You ride with Annabelle...
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
So I'll have to order in?
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
You don't trust me to be alone with them.
Look.  I know they hate me.
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
Get ready.  To get <u>really</u> mad.
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
I think so...What do you think?
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
It's just an assignment.
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
She's not gonna die.
What a great surpri...
Well, they will be.
She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.
Can we go sit somewhere?
That's not us.
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
Does Jackie know this?
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
Maybe he's gay.
Don't ever say that.
What if he is?
Out! Leave the table!
Hey.
What?
There are some rumors...
You know...Stanley...
No prob. I'm cool.
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.
He was in a concentration camp?
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
Welcome to the show, Scooby.
Thank you.
Nice to have you here.
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Consuelo?
Yes.
Really? How many?
I did not go to high school.
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
We had to work. My family was poor.
Must've been hard being poor.
Consuelo. Are you crying?
Mi Jesusmi jesus
Speak English.
My Jesus
Who is Jesus?
My baby.
You have a bay?
He's dead.
How did they execute him?
He wasn't.
But still, you can't be sure.
I am sure.
But really, you never know.
I know!
Why was he on Death Row?
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
No, you don't.
Yes, I knowBut still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
What's an audience going to tell you?
Twinkeys!
Mom?
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.
Was anyone in my room today?
What are you going to do?
We did the same thing last year also.
Fine.
Ready for tomorrow?
I can read it to you.
You mean, again?
Well, I changed the ending a little.
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
You're tired of me. I can tell.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
What do you want?
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
You know he hated my story also.
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
But what kind of pull did you have?
So? How was school today?
The same.
The same. Same as what?
Get the hell outta here!
Scooby?
Yeah?
OK.
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
Hey, Mikey!
Hi, Dad!
Come here, give me a hug!
Hello, Vi.
What are you doing here?
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
Uh huh.
No.
It's over there.
Say, Ni...
Ni...
...gger.
...gger.
Say, 'Nigger.'
Nigger.
'Fuck me hard!'
Fuck me hard!
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Again!
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
Again!!
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Hello?
Hello, is this Pam?
Who is this?
Toby Oxman.
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Oh, fine. How are you?
Great!
Great!
That's what I was gonna ask you.
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
Oh, I don't remember that...
Yeah. But not any more.
Yeah.
Huh. Kids?
Yeah.
How many?
Three.
Great. How old are they?
OK. Bye.
Pretty cool, Stanley.
Thanks.
Gee, your Dad's smart.
Is it loaded?
Scooby, don't! Be careful!
Scooby?
Yeah?
You know...I like you.
Yeah. I know.
You want some?
You a pervert?
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Is this to like get into Sundance?
So where'd you get in?
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
He did?
Yeah. He went to Harward.
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
Well, I-I hope that--that--
Well get someone down there!
I'll lead.
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
What are we going to do!
What now?
--be prepared.
We don't have time!
Let's move it we got company!
What's that supposed to mean?
Cooper...
Now what?
Because I'll be firing at them.
Well Filmore--
I have a lighter!
Are the labs in operation?
How's the arm?
That's it!  Up ahead!
Enjoying the tour so far?
Are you going to kill us?
Come on, drink up.
I don't want any...
She's still alive.
What about Cooper--where is he?
Who's Ryan Cooper?
So, what are we looking at White?
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.
Good.
I say we head out.
Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
Drop the anchor!
We can't--it's power driven!
Just what the hell is he talking about?
Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
What does that mean?
Can I have a glass of water?
Possibly some coffee?
Don't be ridiculous.
I have your word, Mister President?
Where are you trying to reach him?
At his office in the Capitol.
Where is this...thing?
That's preposterous!  We have no such program!
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
That's nonsense, and you know it!
Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.
Perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source?
My seven body orifices????
Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
Now, snap out of it, fella!
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
What is your name, young lady?
Yes!
General Schmuck?
Go back to sleep, baby.
Well, Mister President.
Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
This is General Ripper speaking.
Do you recognize my voice?
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.
Who do you think you're talking to?
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
Plan-R????
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?
I suppose they are, sir.
You're damned right they are.
How much soda, sir.
What shall we drink to, sir?
General Ripper, can I ask another question?
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
Where, sir?
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
Major, you're talking like one of them!
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
Do you think we'd cheat?
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
To peace on earth, Major.
It was a honest mistake, sir.
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
General Jack D. Ripper, sir.
I want to talk to General Ripper.
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
How long will it take to receive them all?
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
Naturally I am, sir.
He says they've only shot down three planes.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
I've got the heading, Major.  One-three-eight.
Roger, maintain.
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
All right...we're still flying.  I'm taking her down to the deck.
Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
What else could it be?
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
Maximum ECM.
Then this is it.
What?
War.
I'm sorry, Major Kong.  I guess I was way out of line.
Speed?
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Call them every five miles.
Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
Why can't he help me now?  He's sitting two feet away from me!
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
They must have made a visual contact.
Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.
I think they mean business.
Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.
No, this looks like the real thing.
Primary arming switch.
I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.
So am I.
Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
Where'd they get you?
What does it look like?
Some kind of signaling.
I've got one.
Are you saying our order don't make sense?
When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
Primary circuit is live.
Release first safety.
Second safety.
Fusing for ten thousand air burst.
Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?
Everything still checks out okay.
Can't "Ace" help you?
He's dead.
Where'd they get you?
How do you know he's dead?
He's dead, all right.
No, look!  It's "OPE - Recall Mistake."
What do you mean?
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
Why should they call us back?
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
Then that settles it, doesn't it?
The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
That's the point.
I don't get you, King.
Take it easy, Major Kong.
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
Maybe the warning system's out.
But I get a red light.
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
I don't anymore.
Can I have some?
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
That was really great.
Was it okay?
Yeah!
What did you guys think?
Typical male.
Typical male.
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
No I quit.
Yup.
Oh. Well, what's it on?
A cloud.
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
Right now?
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
And your mom.
No, I'm here. Where are you?
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
It's your birthday?
Yeah.
Pony's coming here to the corner?!
That's the rock star thing.
Sorry.
You wanna bet he's with a girl?
No, he's not with a girl.
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
A long, long, long, long, while.
Okay, okay.
So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
You know what we should do? Go to the...
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
No. Life is too short.
No, I'm not worried.
Sure.
Yeah.
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
I know, man.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Y- s-sure it did.
No. It didn't, Buff.
Wait. Hey, man.
What?
Look.
Hey, man.
She's in the van.
Buff...
What?
She's dead.
Bullshit.
No, no, no.
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
Hey, I'm Sooze.
Yeah.
Come on.
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
Hey, man.
Your his publicist?
Sure I am. It's fun.
What do you mean? His girlfriend?
Well, that's one way of putting it.
Am I fucking him?
So, then, you're, like, available?
In what way?
Buff.
Yes! Free concert!
Hey! Hey.
I'm so burnt-out.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
I can come visit?
You better! Yes!
Score! Yeah!
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
It's safe, come on.
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
Are you talking to me?
It's okay.
Good. See you later.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
Oh, you were there?
No, but I heard it was great.
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
Please.
Whoa!
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
You could do it.
Yeah!
Yes!
Yeah!
You okay, man? You okay?
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Thanks, man!
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
Okay.
Come on. Inside.
Hi.
You rich?
No, not really. Middle-class.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
Thinks he is. Well, he is.
He is?
Yes.
He is.
A Porsche.
Mm.
Yeah. So, what about you?
I'd like to.
Oh, yeah?
What was your name again?
It's a mistake to think that.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
It's nice to do a lot of things.
That's what I mean.
I'm not a nice guy.
I know. It's okay.
No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
Taking care of business.
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
I'd love to read that.
Um, mother-daughter.
It's coming along.
Erica, you coming?
Two-fifty.
Two-fifty? They go up?
He's drunk.
Who were you talking to?
Yeah, yeah, I stay at the Four Seas, it's ease.
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
Tim, what are you talking about?
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
What? What'd you do?
That chick, Erica?
What'd you do?
You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
Why? Because I give a shit?
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
I don't know.
You don't know?
No.
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
Jeff! Come up here!
Is that Bee-Bee?
What?
Seven-twenty.
Why we're just standing here.
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Nazeer what?
God, I haven't seen you all day.
You could've come over.
No.
It's a piece.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
Yes, you asshole.
Of course I do!
Name one.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
One!
Your completely missing the point.
Hey!
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
But do you stand for anything?
Yes, I stand for -
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
Can I talk?
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
This is ridiculous!
Oh, yeah?
Okay, what would you have done.
I would've stopped it.
What feelings?
Of course.
And?
Nothing.
New ground?
Yes, you do.
No, I don't.
You do.
Come on.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
Oh, hi. I thought you guys got lost.
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
Oh, yeah?
I, yeah.
No, no, I have to talk to you.
Where are you going?
For a ride.
Wait, away?
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
To his hotel?
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
Oh, no, no, no.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
You did, huh? Good for you.
'Bye, Jeff.
Go.
What?
You really suck, you know that?
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Yeah, I crash there.
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
Sorry.
So you think I should?
Like songs?
Yeah, they could be songs.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Now?
Great.
Well, not exactly.
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
Get off my property!
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
Get off my roof!
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
No, this has everything to do with you.
Pony, oh my god!
Is that your driver?
It's stupid.
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
Look at you!
Oh, yeah?
So? What's L.A. like?
It's pretty exciting.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
You're not serious.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
Yeah?
Yeah, come on, play it.
Alright, alright already.
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
I can't believe you're still here.
I'm moving.
If...
No, I'm going.
Soon.
Yep.
I don't know. I say what I mean.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
Is that Jeff?
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
What the fuck are you talking about?!
"See what's around you listen to their lies"
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
It's none of my business?
Don't do that.
What are you going to do? Hm?
If you hit me...
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Just one?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
So where are you?
Seriously? It's a great idea.
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
I'm going out later.
No car.
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
I just pulled and it - it came off.
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Holy shit.
I'm in, too.
Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!
Another sex dream?
Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
You sure?
... I don't know.  Probably not.
But, we have to make a smart plan!
She thinks you went to the police.
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
Y'think?
Jack, I think I should get a job.
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
That was gas, Sweetie.
Oh... What are you working on?
Madonna.
Hat-trick?
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
NO!  Wait...um...  We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? So, uh...
Oh no...
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
That you?
Hello?
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Ammo?
Screw Lucy!
Is that you down there?
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate.  Where's my smokes?
Really...
Definitely old.
Yeah.  This summer at church camp?  I'm pretty sure I had, y'know, an orgasm.
Oh my G-d!  I'm not first!
You sure you wanna go there?
All of you!
Bank branch!
You shouldn't smoke so many of those.
Now how the hell can I help you?
My best friend got pregnant.
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
More proof God's a guy...
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
What the hell do you want?
Roll 'em.
Give me your coat.
Let it ride for a while.
You're going to stay, aren't you?
That was the general idea.
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
What's wrong with it?
It's from hunger.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
Hurt feelings department.
You forgot this.
I've been hoping to run into you.
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
Why, you sweet kid.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
I didn't.
Is there someplace we can talk?
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
As for instance?
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
You'll be waiting for me?
With a wildly beating heart.
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
He thinks it could be made into something.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
I tell you this is half sold.
Sorry if I crossed you up.
You sure have.
I'll make it short.
It's just impossible.
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
Who's Norma?
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
May I say you smell real special.
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Why not?
It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
I don't want it now.
What happened?
This is where you live?
You bet.
Hers.
Joe, I can't look at you any more.
Hello, young fellow.
Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
Just a minute, you!
Yeah?
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
We've made a lot of pictures together.
And you'll play Salome?
Well?
This is fascinating.
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
What month?
You know, I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.
I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
It's getting kind of late --
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
There sure is.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
I'll take care of that.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
What's that?
Just a scene I cut out.
I want to talk to you for a minute.
Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
They've come for my car.
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
I need some money right now.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
How about some evening clothes?
I don't need a tuxedo.

You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
Don't bend back like that.
What are the notes?
What right do you have to take me for granted?
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
You're really going to send it to De Mille?
Have one of mine.
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
I ran into some people I knew.
Where are my cigarettes?
Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
I think I'll read a little.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
I went for a walk.
I haven't done anything, Norma.
Yes, I am, Norma.
The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
That's a lie!  They still want me!
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
Look, maybe I'd better take my car --
You are not dressed properly.
Suppose you listen just for a minute -
Madame is waiting.
This room has not been used for a long time.
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
I'm not here.
That's what I told them.
Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.
How come?
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
How is she?
Mr. Gillis, if you please.
You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
Joseph C. Gillis?
We've come for the car.
Relax, fans.  The car isn't here.
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
Got a title?
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
Along is no good.  I need it now.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?
Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
Madame is wanted on the telephone.
You know better than to interrupt me.
Paramount is calling.
Who?
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
What is the scene? Where am I?
This is the staircase of the palace.
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.
What is it?
Is he your entertainment for tonight?
A Storm Dragon?
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
I think I'd better keep it.
Whatever you say.
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
I don't feel like it right now.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
What do you want?
Is this Nigel's doing?
It's a warning, that's for sure.
Wait...don't leave me in here...
What's happening?
I'm taking you to the hospital.
Don't leave me.
I have to.
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
We have to have a long talk about all this.
This is my favourite place in the city.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
Yes. It reminds me of home.
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
Let's talk about us, not her.
Tell me where I can find her.
We can't do that.
Why not ?
All this talk about love, it's silly.
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
What's that?
Let me kiss you.
No.
Is this how?
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
She said it wouldn't last.
I don't love you any more.
Just like that?
Away. From you.
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
I sort of like what you said.
That makes it worse.
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
I'm not mad at you.
You think so?
I don't see why not.
But what if---it wasn't real?
Are you asking me for a "date"?
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
Before you go...
It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
How do I fight it?
She's right. They'll string her up.
I did.
Finished your estimate?
Well, there's several ways to go .
You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
What is it?
A passionfruit smoothee.
Oh no, not you again.
What an adorable hat.
They think I have a concussion.
And you think you're in love.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
I don't want your help.
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
Guess! Go on.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
Well...I guess I can't.
You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.
Hey, where you going?
I've got things to do.
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
Can I give you a lift?
Yes.
Did anybody notice you?
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
You bet your ass.
Why didn't you tell me?
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
What are you making:
I don't understand.
You see, a tree is a living thing.
There isn't any.
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
I'd rather not talk about it.
She did that deliberately.
How'd you do that?
Your hair looks the same.
No thanks. You go on.
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
Why is he acting so strangely?
Lucy; come back!
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
Don't you believe in knocking?
What can I do for you?
No plans for the weekend, Linda?
What? Me?
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
Balefire on you, Selena!
Nigel, get lost.
I have to talk to you.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
That was meant for me!
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
Where is inner space?
I was on Earth...
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
Zaltar, please help me.
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
There is a way.
I knew it!
But it's impossible.
You're going to take me back?
You can use the wand.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
Zaltar. Use the wand!
Goodbye...
Yeah? What do you want?
What are you talkin' about?
Not enough vodka in it.
There's no vodka in it.
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
You know what's the problem?
You...um...you never got married?
But all he had was chocolate milk.
Gee, I haven't done this in years.
Peanut butter and jelly.
I can never get a way from it.
He really was!
Uh-huh.
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
Uh...excuse me, folks...
Well...  Not quite like this.
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
Do you really know Superman?
So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
Name?
Yeah.
What kind?
Kitchen. . . Technician
Dishwasher? Any luck?
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
Sonofagun! Look at this here!
So where is all them half-centses?
How many sugars?
Gus?
Say what?
The boss wants to see you.
You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
Black or regular?
Man, what is this?
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
Just the man I wanted to see!
Turn on the T.V.
I did. isn't it neat-o?
Uh...what channel were you watching?
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
KRYPTONITE!
And do nothing. Just sit there.
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
Is this whitemail?
Fair's fair.
For what?
A computer.
What will it do?
Everything.
What will it get me?
Anything.
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
We gonna crash?
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
Who's the other woman?
What about me?
Thank ...you.
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
There's no rush.
Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
Lots of things...
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
I don't know you, lady.
How would you know?
Hey, I know a lot of things!
I can't see anything.
Turn on the light.
Where's the light switch?
I can't! It's out of control!
Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
Mr. White, the next number, please?
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
85,000 dollars.
I don't kiss.
Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
Storms! Floods!
She's not his mama either.
Today coffee----
We already have a super-tanker.
Where did it come from?
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
Come on, let's give it a dry run.
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
Jimmy, how's the -
Anybody been hurt?
Hostages?
Are you okay?
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
Lois, what are you doing?
Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
Maybe I could try --
It is kinda romantic.
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
Lois, you're amazing.
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
Oh Clark, no!
It's true. It's true.
Lois, I . . .
I was right. you are Superman.
We'd better talk.
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
Hi.
Sleep well?
Everything on it?
Does Lois know about this yet?
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
Good. My heart can't take it.
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
This way Lex.
Genius!  --  Lex.
I'll be alright.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
It's beautiful.
It has everything.
Artemis? Do you read me?
I think he said a "curl."
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
I want my Liberace record back tonight.
Where?
North.
Why?
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
He flies as well, then . . .
What do you want?
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
There is something more you want. The 								greed is written on your face.
What more?
Put down Lex Luthor !
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
Free!
So this is the planet Houston . . .
What shall we do now?
You are master of all you survey.
General --- ?
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
You're late. Very late.
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.
Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
Oh . . . my . . .
Gee, I'm really sorry.
I'm not so sure you do.
Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Well, I don't understand.
Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
Daddy . . . ?
Yes, darling?
Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
I think there's an angle.
And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
But he's never there.
What's he going to say?
What's that?
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.
Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
Hey! He looks . . . normal.
Hey! Just remember I made you.
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
We'll all fry.
This wasn't in the plan.
You are . . .
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
I am an experiment? I am freako?
Destroy Superman!
Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!
Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
Superman. . .  But you're... dead!
Nobody else.
He's thirty-five years old.
You're a great architect, Albert.
I've been on the job.
A hot story, huh?
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
Mom...
Mother...
Do you know where you're headed?
Keep warm now.
I'd like to.
Your bookie?
Not...gray.
Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
Some people aren't the athletic type.
Hey!
Stop him, Clark!
He may have a gun!
You described the exact contents of my purse.
What now, my love?
Can I take you to the airport?
Not unless you can fly.
Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -
There weren't any wires. I looked.
Jealous? Of what?
What'd you call him?
Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
Screaming
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
Again???
You think he's for real?
Nuts. He made it.
Bet he makes it.
Shut up.
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
I read the article.
We just take it?
Ready?
Don't let me down.
You?! How about me?
A night on the town instead of under it?
This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
Oh. Why? does he live up here?
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
I'm wearing it.
I mean the other one!
What other one?
You can't do this to me!
But you can't ignore these facts!  It's suicide!  Worse than that, it's genocide.
Then -
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
Gets you where you live, huh?
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
It's a ...baby.
The good lord works in mysterious ways.
What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
-- as we will be.
But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
He will be odd, different.
You've been doing some research in the archives.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
Enjoyed it?
I guess I got carried away
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
No! You couldn't imagine -
How good it felt!
Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
Easy now, miss, I've got you???
You've got me? Who's got you???
Do as I say. Let go!
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
With my luck, now it'll rain.
Superman???
Right on the first guess.
I came to talk to you.
Oh, I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
You think they're strange?
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
It must feel great.
It's not bad.
Thirty-five.
How much do you weigh?
What about it?
Can you really see through anything?
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
Do bullets really bounce off you?
Sure.
Do you like pink?
Very much.
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
What's the matter, Otis?
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
I gave him steady employment --
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
Please...
Is that real enough for you?
You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
Of time, Luthor.
On radio waves?
Yes.
Ally.  That was my nickname.
Ally.  That's right.
How are you?
I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
Ally Jones.
How is Mrs. Stephens?
We're...not together.
I'd heard that.  But she's well?
Yes...fine.
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
Which one?
Which one?
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
Then...when did she get better?
She didn't.
But you said...
That's where I'm going.  To see her.
I'm...so sorry.
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
Alison.
Alison.
Say hi to Zoe.
I will.
I understand.
I can help you.
Hi, Nicole.
Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...
They just finished supper.
I'll be back around nine.
Are you sure?
Why?
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
I'm not sure.
Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
Billy, please.  The children.
How is Nicole?  Is she around?
She's resting.  In her room.
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.
Because it's what we have to do.
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
No, Billy.  We can't drop the lawsuit.  You know how much we need the money.
She said she's got to be home by nine.
Have you been waiting long?
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
What time's he coming home?
Yes.
It's natural.
You're leaving.
Good night, Billy.
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
You believe that?
I have to.
Why?
Because I have to.
Dolores.  No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'.
What do you mean by that, Dolores?
About the Ottos?
I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...
For rabbits?
From what?
You talked about it?
Berry-picking.
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
And what's that?
What do you mean?
That's right.
Did his parents attend to that?
What do you mean?
That would complicate things.
He knows that?  Billy?
Yes.  He does.
You've talked to Billy?
What other people?
You heard what Abbott said?
Yes.
Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.
What do you think?
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
You hate it.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
No.  A little sugar though.
We've only got honey.
What happened to summer?
Summer's over.  It's fall.
And winter?
Is this mine?
Yes.  It's a present.
Nicole!
Did he say what about?
Was he drinking?  Could you tell?
Is he coming over now?  Right away?
Nicole?
Nicole?
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
The people in the town?
Yes.
So he was mean?
Oh.
That you didn't die?  Like the other children?
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
I won't lie.
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
You seem very sure about that.
There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?
I have no questions.
Do you have a room?
Will you be spending more than a night?
What do you mean?
Have they ever been busted?
You always think you're prepared for these things.
Tell me about it.
How old is she?
Almost three.
Is this it?
Perfect.
Here we go.
DADDY!!!
Yes, I'll accept the charges.
Daddy?
News?
Don't you want to hear?
Yes.
I tested positive.
Yes.
I need money.
Do you have the blood test?
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
What is it?
We do.
Is there shrimp on it?
If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
Who are you?
I'm a lawyer.
No.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
You've been retained?
Are you expensive?
Are you a reporter?
What time in the morning was this?
No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
And where did you sit that morning?
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
Yes.
You remember that much?
You are?
Before the actual accident?
I was scared.
Yes, I understand.
Why were you scared?
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
Seventy-two miles an hour.
You saw the speedometer?
No.
I was scared.  And there wasn't time.
That was great.
You're going to blow everyone away.
You mean it?
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
What took so long?
How do you like it, Nicole?
The ramp?
Pretty slick, eh?
Very slick.
Do you like the colour?
The door needs a lock.
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
Nothing good on your T.V.?
Are you sleeping?
What's going to happen to Dolores?
I don't know.
She'll move away.
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
But of course...
Hello, Sidney.  Wanna table?
Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
He's somewhere...
Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please.
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.
See my mother?
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
How is dear old J.J. by the way?
And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
Does he have to be here in our hair?
Why, has he bothered you before?
Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill.  Just give us the punch line...
You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
Not being partial, are you?
Sidney is a liar!
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
Susie, I'm sorry if---
No!  NO!  Don't touch me!
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
Can I come in for a minute?
Mac!  I don't want this man at my table...
I know Manny Davis.
Match me, Sidney...
Spahish...that must show he likes "spigs", too.
J.J., I want you to get them back their job, Steve and the Quintet.
Get Steve back his job...please...
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
I got that boy coming over here.  What's so funny?
And who's feet is she on now?
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
Talk to her, Sidney...
I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town.
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
I don't think so.
You're sure.  Find out for me.
Is Frank D'Angelo around?
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
In his apartment -
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
Do you still keep your key under the mat?
Don't you know who that man is?
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
What sort of thing?
What would you think of me if -
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
That's the third time he's called today.
But...
Who else phoned?
The renting agent and the tailor.
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
Go home, Sally.  It's late...
If that's for me, tear it up!
What's the matter?
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...
That's no way to talk...
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
Where's those glossy prints you promised?  Tonight's the latest I can place them -
It's a habit with me.  So now I'm briefed.  So what?
Why me...?
Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous!
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?
We stick in each others craw.
Where do you come off to make a remark like that?
J.J., if you think -
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!
You haven't told him yet...
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
I made you write a beautiful song...
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
Do you know about the chip?
My God.
No good.
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
My mission is to protect you.
So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you?
What does that mean?
Liquid metal.
You sure?
Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
Oww!  Why'd you do that?
You have to do what I say?!
That is one of my mission parameters.
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
Swear.
Everything.
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
Chill out, dickwad.
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean.
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
Alriight!!  My man!
She intends to change the future somehow.
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
This is tactically dangerous.
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
I'll deal with the police.
Remember what I said, you can't...
Drive for a minute.
We don't have much time.
Is it dead?
Will it melt in there?
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
I have to go away, John.
It must end here... or I am the future.
Easy money!
Out of the way, John!
No!  Don't kill him!
It, John.  Not him.  It.
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
I love you, John.  I always have.
I got it.  Piece of cake.
Ready to rock?
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
I love you.  I always will.
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
Can it be destroyed?
You look like handmade shit.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
The CPU from the first terminator.
I must be destroyed.
It's finally over.
Are you afraid?
Where do you stand on all this?
On all what?
On Furtwängler.
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
Respect your elders and your betters!
And no elbows on the table!
What does he mean, too correct?
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.
I guess you admire musicians.
I guess it's possible.
Yes.
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
You bet.
What?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
Furtwängler's in a different category.
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
No can do.
Let Furtwängler go. Please.
You live here, in Berlin?
Yes.
You do shorthand and typing?
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
Mine's the Eleventh.
No. Ours was damaged.
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
I can't do this. It's not right.
I made no deal!
I don't buy that.
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
May I ask a question?
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
How?
I was warned.
Who warned you?
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
If it's too hot, open your tie.
And what was that?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
Von der Null?
Yes, von der Null.
And what happened to Von der Nul?
I have illegitimate children.
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Do you know what that is?
Of course I know what that is.
Okay, so what is it?
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
That's what I asked.
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
Do you know what's in this archive?
Major.
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
It's Dr. Furtwängler's baton, which I stole.
Yes, you remember.
Show me.
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
I've remembered something else...
One of your people told me.
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.
And ask him about his private life.
Was looking at Furtwängler like that?
I don't know what you mean, Major.
You were in insurance before the war.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -
Yes, Chuck?
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
Alright!
Can you handle it?
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
What do you think?
Great.
Alright, the beige one.
Not lately.  Did you check messages?
What's it to ya?
You must have a girlfriend.
That's none of your business.
Do you understand?
This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
There's so much...
Freezing.
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
I caught one, back there.
John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...
Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's better tight.
Good field-dressing.
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
About what?
Bag some Z's?
Thanks a lot.
That's where we're going.
Let's go.  Time to move out.
My whole life has been combat.
He'll find us, won't he?
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
Someone?
A girl.  You know.
So much pain.
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
And so you feel nothing.
It's better that way.
I bet you're ticklish.
What are you doing?
I don't think I like this.
What are you doing?
So.  You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Surrounded by living tissue.
You've heard enough.  Decide. Are you going to release me?
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
I can help you...
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
That stuff's two hours cold.
Did you reach the next girl yet?
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
Call her.
I just called.
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
Go!  Go!  He's got her.
Projections were far too optimistic.
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
But, the expectation was ten.  And, in this case, expectation is everything.
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...
You don't talk to me like that.
I apologized, I offered to help.
I'm so sorry.
Pardon me... Miss... ?
Excuse me, I need to explain...
What's with him?
Do you know what to do?
Oh, God... !
Don't just stand there, get help!
Alright... okay...
This is nuts.
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
You've got to be kidding.
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
I'm sorry, about this...
There's got to be a flashlight.
See you around.
Where are you going?
It was a gift... from my brother.
Don't even think about it.
I'll give you a boost.
There's a ladder here.
This is C.R.S.
What's C.R.S.?
They'll love that.
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
You're the one who started running.
There goes a thousand dollars.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
That one did.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
That's classic.
Where are we going?
What exactly do you do?
Nice.
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
The maitre d' called you Christine.
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
What are you doing here?
Can we talk?
What is it?
Is this you?
Well... the red bra.
Okay.
Do you mind if I sit?
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
Want anything to drink?
They're watching.
Wha... ?
No!  I'm sick of this...
What is this!?
What are you doing... ?
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
How?  How could they have gotten anything?
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
What did you say?
My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
It might be best if we didn't talk.
All I mean is... someone like you...
What?
Scams, con games.  How many?
Who is it?
What... what do you mean?
I'm back from the dead.
Get us out of here...
Nicholas...
Who's responsible?!
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
Where'd you get that... ?
What the fuck are you... ?
Where'd you get that gun?
It's mine...
We searched the house.
Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
Stop talking...
No!  You take another step, I'll shoot!  They're trying to kill me...
Stop it!
Don't move, you bitch... !
I have to show you...
Claire.
I have to get to the airport...
What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Like... where are you from?
Originally, Connecticut.
Big family... small?
One brother, one sister.
Studied acting, I assume?
Julliard, yeah.
Single?
Yes.
Boyfriend?
No.
Underwear?
Hey there, Nickie.
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
They gave me a free jacket at the door.
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
Yeah.
You need anything?
No.
For you.
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
Trust me.  Call that number.
This isn't an escort service?
It's a profound life experience.
Like a stroke?
Tell me you'll call.
Okay.
Will you?
I said I would...
But, will you?
Are you still on mediction?
I'll call them, okay?
I'm going to call.
Tell me where we're going.
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
What's this all about, Connie?
What are you doing?
Yeah, almost...
You dodged a bullet.
What have they been doing to you?
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
It's them.  They did this.
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
The phone's dead.
You're part of it...
No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
Really?
Yeah.
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
Robbed?
I'll explain someday.
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
I'll call.  I really will.
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
Oh... it's a game.
What kind of vacation?
It's different every time.
Humor me with specifics.
And if nothing's lacking?
How long will these take?
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
Get rid of them.
I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.
Goddamnit, why do they do that?
How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.
They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
You don't need me...
Where'd you pick up your checks?
Guess!
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
Ah, Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go...
The key?
Hm?
Is there a room key?
Didn't I give you two?
Thank you.
Dinner's in the oven.
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
Is everything alright?
Mr. Van Orton... ?
Ilsa... you're alright?
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Not much, I think.
Did you worry about him?
Goodnight.  See you home.
Your brother.  Will you come with me?
Invitations: the Museum Gala.
No.
What gentleman, Maria?
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
What the fuck... ?!
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
Anything wrong... ?
Attractive...
Don't ask.
What's happened...
How concerned should I be?
Just what I told you.
He hasn't called back.
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
Uh... Nell Vance...
And what kind of sleeper?
I only saw Theo drive up.
The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?
That could have been worse.
And those are Luke's and mine.
Do we still get paid for the week?
It's not going to hold your weight.
Hey!  I heard screaming...
I didn't do it.
We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
All night?
Yeah.
You want company?
Was sure she'd be in here.
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
You don't believe in the paranormal.
No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
No.
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
Eleanor, how was the drive?
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
Nell!  What's wrong?
What did it smell like?
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
Like she smelled it too?
Yes.
And then what happened?
I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
I don't know.
It was.
Someone is playing with you.
Why?
The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me.
But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!
Come on.
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
That?  That's Hill House.
This is where we're going?
Have either of you seen David Watts?
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
Maybe they're Mary's.
Get a blanket!
Oh God, we can't get out!
Oh!  You scared me.
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Is there something about the house?
That's where she hanged herself.
Why'd she kill herself?
Yes.
She was unhappy.
Mrs. Dudley.
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
What did it cost?
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
That's why we're here.
Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
Jeez.
A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.
Yes.  I've missed it.
Good night, Theo.
Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
How could he have left without his keys?
What's his first name?
Is it over?
Theo... Did you?
Maybe you did it yourself.
I don't know what to think anymore.
Well?
Are you sure?
I think so.
I don't think I want any.
What'd you come back for, babe?
Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
Is that a problem?
Not for you, clearly.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
Am I a thing?
Well, you're certainly not a person.
It's not a knock.
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
As soon as you get dressed.
What kind of food?
Anything but Japanese.
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
Italian?
I'm sorry.
Italian.
I like the colors.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
We think someone is here.
No.
Why not?
Hey.
How they goin', kid?
Same as last time -- the rest after.
Where do we go?
What.
There's been some trouble downtown.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
You broke last time.
Fuck you.
I wouldn't talk.
Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
You're in gun country now, my friend.
Man knows what he likes.
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
Edward Rama?
Eduardo.  Rama.
I didn't expect anyone.
Who done it, then?
Boomerang.
You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
No.  Not at all.  Do we?
Five years, I think.  Long time.
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
What?
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
That was one of them?
What's so fucking funny?
Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
No one else is even here yet.
What are we standing on?
You goin' back inside?
That would be too easy.
Too easy?
I've been wondering something.
What d'you say, Elaine?
Not much -- you?
Really.
Didn't get it.
You just cooking then?
Had a feeling it was you.
You look alike.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Why did you come here?
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
Sort a few things out.
Been busy, have you.
How d'you mean?
That's not what I heard.
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
Oh, it just ended, then.
Not embarrassed.
Ashamed.
Disappointed.
In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
When did you get in?
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
What's that, like a P.O. box.
Something like that, yeah.
-- Your employer?
-- Mr. Lindgren.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
My employer.
What line is he in.
I bet.
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
Why not.
You don't believe it was a car accident.
Depends, don' it.
On what.  What makes you so certain.
I'll bloody well ask him.
How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.
Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
It didn't discourage you, though.
Hey?
I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
Who remembers.
Get seven years, did you?
Overnight.  What about just now?
You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
You ever been to London?
Only in the movies.
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
Not that I recall.
What'd your father do?
I guess you're just habitual.
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
Where's Big Sur?
Up the coast.
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
What's in Big Sur?
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
How do you know?
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
It was you.  Downtown.
All of what?
Of the deal, man.
As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
And that is?
Where is he now?
Don't you work with Ian?
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
I would have preferred staying home, me.
You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
Been away a lot.
Sounds like you need a rest.
How much.
I got half.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Yeah.
Which kind?
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
I don't know.
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
She's nice lookin'.
I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
What d'you mean, any happier?
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
There is?
Something's on.
You do?
You bet.
What's in it?
How'd you get in here.
Is Valentine here?
Hello there.
What are you doing here?
Exercising my visitation rights.
Since when?
You've made it ... brighter.
I don't want you here, Terry.
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
-- You know his name is Frank.
Is he here?
In a couple of days this whole thing --
Who's looking for you?
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
Ah.
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
What.
Tell me.
Hello, Ed.
...I'm so sorry about your loss.
Yes, Ann?
Hello, Mr Crane.
Yeah.
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
...I stank, didn't I?
He didn't say that.
But more or less.
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
Huh.
You're an enthusiast.
...I guess I've been all wet.
Birdy--
...No, please.
...You are ze fahzer?
Uh-huh.
Ah yes, a music lover.
...Mm.
...she can go up there.
You got the dough?!
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
No. I--tell me--
...Was that a pass?
Maybe.
Right! Strictly business.
...You bring a check?
Cash.
That'll be fine.
How ya doin', Ed?
...Were you in the service, Ed?
Mm.
She's a rare one.
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
...Ed, I...
Well, you know what that would do to me.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
Please, Ed.
But it's...
Your place?
What kind of man *are* you?
Rye.
Told what?
Honey?
Come on, get ready. It's important.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
...What a knucklehead.
Who?
Dave.
How's that?
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.
Honey.
I don't know what's going on. I--
Should I... should I tell you why?
OK, how did you know?
Will anyone else say they knew?
I don't know. I don't think so.
How did you get into the store?
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
Oh, hell. Drink?
No thanks.
Sure you don't need one?
I'm fine.
So--
Taking it seriously.
Coffee, Ed?
I'm fine. Thanks.
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
Ed, how're you holding up?
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
I don't work here. My wife does.
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
That was quite something.
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
Uh-huh.
...Ed?
Huh?
Russians exploded an A-bomb.
Yeah.
...You sure, Eddie?
Frank.
Huh?
This hair.
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
...How you today, Ed?
OK.
You don't got a headache?
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
That's very generous.
...We goin'?
Birdy... I didn't mean to--
'Lo, Ed.
Mr...?
...You're Ed Crane?
Hello!
OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
Yes, sir.
Could you come with me please?
Ah.
Second chair.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
You'll go to the prison hospital.
What'd he say? Does he understand?
Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
Someone broke into this room.
I'll go down and speak to him.
Where's the walk-in safe?
Behind you.
Forget it!
Battery's dead.  Shit.
Ippolito!  Get back here!
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
Who are you?  The undertaker?
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
The body?
What's left of it.
We need light in here, stat.
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
Lieutenant --
You're kidding.
How big is the sub-basement?
Apparently it's huge.
Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
Look.  It's some kind of letter.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
What is it?
Dr. Green has to see you!
It's still back there!
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.
What's that?
What does it say?
Dr. John Whittlesley.
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
What are we talking about here?
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
Curious.  There's something missing.
Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
I'm not giving up.
Margo, these aren't seed pods.
What are they?
Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?
Come back and get me.
Dr. Frock?
Something tried to get into this room!
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
What's that?
Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
You work here?
Yes, I do.
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
We're not supposed to go back there.
I don't want to go this way.
Quiet!
Big as a house.
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
They were yellow!
Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
They've got something.
Shut them up!
Stop!
Argo!  Hobbes!
Oh... my... God!
Jesus, what is this?
Oh no.  I smell it.
Margo, you haven't heard?
What?
Mbwun.
What do you make of it, Margo?
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
What kind of egg is it?
Is Dr. Frock safe!
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
You were going to be married.
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
What happened?
Where did you see it?
That's not what I saw.
Pendergast?  Are you all right?
Gone.
That was D'Agosta.
The planetarium!
Hide quickly!
What is it doing?
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
I think... it means it's full.
Then it won't go after the others?
Help someone!
You smell that?
Just like John.  He won't listen.
I have to shoot.
I can't!
I'm sorry to keep you.  How can I help?
Where exactly?
<i>Fiji.</i>
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
Viti Levu.  For how many?
<i>A month.</i>
Why wouldn't I?
That's right.
You want to book the flight?
Why is he in the basement?
What's to see?
Give me a shot from Truman's ring.
What have we missed?
We're not watching the sea.
Why would we--
Cue music...
What music?
He doesn't care.
Welcome.
Amnesia.
A window onto the human condition?
Are we talking Emmies?

Who are you?
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
The memory of who?
How can they have a child?
You think she'd go through with it?
Sure she would.
Oh, yes.
Lauren, right?
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
No.
Actually, I'm free Sunday.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
Well, what do you want to do?
It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.
I've got to talk to you.
Sorry, I'm way behind.
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
I think I'm mixed up in something.
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
I told you I can't.
What're we doing here, Truman?
This is where it started.
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
What's that?
Well, what do you think?
I won't be late.
Where have you been?
I've been thinking--
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this now and then.  Come to bed.
What're you doing down here?
What did you want?
I made macaroni.
Come on, Truman.  Haven't you studied enough?
Good night, Mother.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
Arrah!
Oh, my God!
I don't know--
--we need more charcoal.
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
Let's go now.
That's right.  I do, don't I?
So why do you want to go?
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
There's been an accident, Truman.
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
Truman, what about that sign?
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.
--What the hell are you talking about?!
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
Who were you talking to?!
How are you, Mother?
Well, I made it through another night.
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
When you get to Fiji?
You got it.
Is there any way around?
The whole area's being evacuated.
Well, thank you for your help.
They're coming.  Any minute.
They're going to stop me talking to you.
I don't understand.
How's it going, Truman?
See you tomorrow, Truman.
Do you live around here?
I think you better tell us.
We don't even know you.
Well, we're FBI agents.
Poopy day?
Yup.
I need your clothes, Byers.
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
Working with?
This man's still alive.
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
We have a situation. The members are assembling.
Who?
You got some kind of business with him?
I'm looking for him.
You looking for him for some other reason?
We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
Have you examined them?
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
Before the bomb went off?
I think you're full of shit.
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
How can I reach you?
What?
I'm not sure. A virus --
That would be my guess.
You told me you had answers.
You've been using me --
I've been using you?!
You didn't know my father --
Where are you, Scully?
I'm on the roof.
Did you find something?
No. I haven't.
Now what?
Had you.
No you didn't.
Scully...
Scully, I found the bomb.
Where are you, Mulder?
Scully, get somebody to open this door.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
Something's not right...
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
I wake you?
No.
Are you drunk, Mulder?
Go home, Mulder. It's late.
Get dressed, Scully.
Mulder -- what are you doing?
According to this tag.
Why are you whispering?
I can't really talk right now.
Evidence of a massive infection.
What kind of infection?
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
And you've never seen anything like that?
This looks like new grass to you?
All the equipment is brand new.
I don't know, Mulder.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
Where would they be going?
You think they went left?
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
This virus -- it... 
Mulder --
This is weird, Mulder.
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
Yeah...?
What are you doing?
Where'd they go?
What? What's wrong?
I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
I have. I did. It's done.
What? What happened?
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
We've got to keep moving.
I can't go any farther.
On whose orders?
I don't know anything about that.
Well, call General McAddie.
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
Agent Mulder --
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
How deep does this go?
What are you doing?
Mr. Mulder.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
Where's Scully?
I have answers for you.
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
Where is he?
What about you?
You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
Sing a song of sixpence...
A pocketful of rye...
Did we go sailing?
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
He hates me.
She adores you.
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
Miriam...
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
Sing a song of sixpence.
Nothing.
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
I'll be fine.
Is it cold in here?
...a pocketful of rye.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Damn him.
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
I don't need them anymore...
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
...give a kiss to Edward.
I realize that...
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
You don't know the procedure.
Edward Baines, I presume.  Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete.
Agent Novak?
With Stargher I saw things...
Why'd you bring him here?
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
Then what is he?
Evil.
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
What happened?
What difference does it make...?
You're sure of that?
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
Where the hell are we?
COME ON!
That went well.
You sure about this?
Yep.  Eloped.
No problem.
You liked him?
What now?
Who says?
Mocky-Lock.
Already there.
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
She changed the codes.
When did he lapse into the coma?
Catherine!
Into Stargher.  Inside...
Nervous?
Prevacid.  For my stomach.
Any psychiatric medication?
No.
What about narcotics?
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
Agent Novak.
Dr. Kent.
Awaiting his arrival.
What about the cat?
Someone looking after her little girl?
I need it.
The dog's an albino.  He'd love an animal like that.
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
You sure you want to go through with this?
Next time, tell me, okay?
Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
Den leuten.
Give her some cigarettes.
Warscheinlich ist der murder.
Thank you.
Do you understand German?
But I could follow it fine. Perhaps Harry told you about me. My name's Holly Martins.
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
No.
He has a little dog.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
His own doctor?
Yes.
He was Harry's driver?
I don't know. They didn't answer.
Anything really wrong with your papers?
They're forged.
Drink?
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
Can I hear you?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
Do I...
Gestern bein heurigen...
What's that?
Tell me about him.
...to steal my girl.
Oh, that was many years ago.
...and buried him.
Seemed like a good idea.
It's just what he used to say.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
We're both in it, Harry.
Holly.
I'm so sorry.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
Let's go away.
What are you going to do?
I wish I knew.
Wer ist da?
I'm going back home.
What happened to your hand?
A parrot...Let it go.
...you know.
Are you going, too?
Harry.
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
Here, it will be cold on that train.
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
He's safe in the Russian zone.
That's his headache.
His.
Oh, well.
Why are you lying?
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
Thank you.
Nichts danke. Kein.
...parents.
They're Harry's.
Do you know this man?
Joseph Harbin...
Must you take those?
They'll be returned, miss.
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
Where?
Just around the corner.
What is it?
Yes, of course.
...Austrian Police Headquarters.
Can you tell me whose...
My name is Calloway.
Martins.
You a friend of Lime's?
Yes.
Been here long?
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
See much of him before that?
Holly Martins.
I can't say that I have.
What?
Him dying like that.
...to him.
What are you trying to say?
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.
Ever seen one?
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
Listen, Callaghan.
What the devil?
Getting around, Martins.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
Miss Schmidt.
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
A parrot bit me.
Well?
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.
So would I.
Bring him in.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
...in the morning.
Well?...
This is where he vanished.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Fifty yards right down there.
A girl of spirit.
Didn't I?
All right, Calloway. You win.
I said you win.
Win what?
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
Wait a minute - let me out.
Well, there's not much time.
Be sensible, Martins.
Shall I go over there, sir?
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
Do you know his number?
...his number.
I'll look it up for you.
Come upstairs a moment.
No, a major, were you really?
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
Mr. Crabbin.
What is it, Sergeant?
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Very popular, sir.
...leaving tomorrow, sir.
Listen...
I want to talk to you.
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
Hmm.
You can help her.
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
Unwise, Holly...
And - Anna...
What do you want me to do?
You can get somebody else...
You've got plenty of contacts.
As long as they can use you?
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
...this way.
Coffee.
You really liked it?
...were of you.
...you know and all that.
...you.
...the best way one can, you know.
Not yet.
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
Dr. Winkel?
Martins.
Coming to the point, please.
Thank you.
Find out?
In great pain?
Speak English?
Already gone.
Coffin?
Baron Kurtz.
Excuse me!
Mr. Lime - yes.
You remember me? Upstairs...
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
Happened...Yes happened right down there.
Could he have been conscious?
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
...give evidence.
Kurtz.
Yes.
The Roumanian?
Yes.
There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.
Yes, it is.
Funny?
That's all you meant?
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
No.
Joseph Harbin.
Third Man.
Mr. Martins...
...this time.
...Mr. Martins?
Passport, please.
What's the purpose of your visit here?
Where are you staying?
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
Lime.  Harry Lime.
Excuse me.
Yes?
I'm Daffy.
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
I'll share something with you.
Bonjour.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
Nice work.
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
We think in miles, not kilometers.
So how many miles do you think it is?
Everyone ok?
We're ok.
Richard - I saw a fin!
What!
Big?
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
I'm sorry.
She is gone!
What about Moliere?
He tried to borrow money from us.
It's on an island that no one get to.
But he has been there, off course.
Two.
Bonsoir.
Did you sleep well?
So from there to there?
We swim.
Have you told someone?
I think so too.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
We lost our key.
They only kill them when they love them?
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
They don't have extermination camps.
Fucking Danny, man...
What do you think you're doing?
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
What do you care?
I don't, but...
Yeah, but not on the letters.
Why the fuck not?
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
I don't care about money.
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
Disease? What disease?
Where'd you read all that stuff?
Why no silencer?
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
What's he care about?
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
Oh, really?
Bigger and better.
Who's Linda?
Why won't you talk to me?
When can I see you?
Your father??
Where'd you get this?
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
Even though his dick is so big?
With you there's a tragic dimension.
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...
Fuck that.
Why should I submit?
You're learning the Hebrew really fast.
I told you, I'm good at this.
The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
I don't know. I just want to try it.
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
You gotta get out of here.
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
That's a much easier game.
I thought there were people here....
Who's Eichmann?
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.
What'd you say?
Why are you taking that?
An investment banking house.
More cultural than political.
That would be a catastrophic mistake.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
And? WHat did you notice?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
I don't know. Is that right?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
He has Israel.
Who? How would I know him?
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
So you're saying it's not true.
Listen to me....
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
What were you, following me?
How do you reconcile the two?
I always won.
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
To hear them read Torah.
I thought you hated Torah.
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
I can't help what I think.
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
A forty-five.
It was a nine millimeter.
I can't say that.
Think about your father. Your sister.
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
I don't do that.
You do it on the inside....
No!
Lina Moebius. And you are...?
Daniel Balint.
Balint?
What part of Germany are you people from?
So what Jew would you kill first?
Do you feel you're making progress here?
How have things been going?
Hello...?
What is happening?
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
What about chicken?
Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
Steve...
They're not my people....
Tell it to Hitler.
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
What kids?...
I've got to get back to the --
Who knows what that is?
Which was his room?
You could do it.
Which one were you aiming at?
Shut up. Fuck you....
Open it up.
This will be a different kind of device.
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
Oh, what is this shit?
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
Not too fast.
You said they didn't have night guards.
Who even knew?
Mrs. Moebius.
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
Where?
It's not going to be fine. It's --
When do you want it to go off?
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
You remember Miriam....
Who'd you kill?
How did you know they were Jews?
I can tell....
Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head.
You missed on purpose.
And what did you do?
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
It's Friday....
"Do chickens give milk?"
Who's this?
Dennis Leary.
Leary?
Howard Stern.
Adam Sandler.
Funny?
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
So what?
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
Are you out of your mind?!
Do you think I...
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
He's shy, not like Enzo.
Yes.
Does he know?
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
Did you tell him?
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
What kind?
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
What d'you mean?
What's happened??
The documents are forged.
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
I tell you she's mine!
You know each other?
Yes.
Where did you two meet?
You forgot the Hula!
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
Congratulations, Enzo.
Well, good night, then...
The Mamma's there too.
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
Jacques!  Johana!
What are you doing here?
Checking out the competition.
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
What else is there?
You risk your life when you cross the street.
Because you'd laugh.
How do you know that?
... Not yet.
Don't.
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
Ten thousand.
Lira?
Roberto?  How long?
Have the car painted.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Then tell him to wax it too.
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
Where did you get that?
Is he here?
Plenty of women everywhere right?
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
It isn't lit yet.
The rules are the rules.
... What's your name again?
And where did you say you were from?
And... does the voice come back?
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
Yes, I know.
I dove 315 feet!
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
What room have you got?
No, no!
Not at all!
Enzo?
What?
Madame...
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
No.
Why?
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
... Everything.
Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did you learn how to drive?
Here...  Here...
You still collect them?
You don't have that one, do you?
Can I come in?
I don't want to erase anything.
Anybody can have a bad day!
Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!
You say that because you have the title!
No!  I would never cheat you.
You were right.
... Push me back in the water...
I can't.
Don't you have a heater?
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
A drink to warm up?
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
In the lake?
Please, have a seat.
No, no.  You'll like it.  It's superb.
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
You look adorable.
Thank you...
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
Lucky I was there to save you.
I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
... No?
How do you know that?
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
Jacques, you set a world record.
I'm going back home.
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
Hello?
How are you?
So have I.  ... Hello?
I'm still here.
Then, tell me a story.
Hello?
I'm being a pain, huh?
... Not at all.
You sure?
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
And you?
I didn't dive.
What?
Jacques...?
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
You've got to tell me what happened?
Promise me one thing.
Anything.
... Are you sure?
This is the hotel San Domenico?
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
Why don't you ask me?
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
Where are you from, Henrietta?
Well... here.
In my apartment?
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
Louis, we were French!
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
You called the police?
Well?
What?
How was your trip?
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
Does that have a hidden meaning?
What are they for?
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
Who... Who is that?
I'll have to talk to the driver.
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
Wait!  Professor...?
I'll go see how he's doing.
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
So why the long face?
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
There won't be any need for that sir.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
So. Do you have a name?
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
Want to get a drink?
What was that!?
Sorry. I'm better with men.
Mordechai?
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
Esther!
Esther!
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
Happy Hanukkah Tikva.
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
What's wrong with him?
A stereo type alarm system?
Hammer, you alright?
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
I wasn't too over the top?
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
What day is it?
My soninlaw. What do you think of him?
Good looking?
Mmmyes.
Is he in love with you?
This is for "mama and the kids."
What about me?
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
Then what do you do?
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
Sure.
Where's that man?
Sure!
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
I don't know. I want to see Robles.
What do you want to see him for?
I want him to lock me up.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
What's left of him.
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
What did they say before the bad card came up?
Don't look at it!
See you tomorrow -
Pedro is waiting for me, too.
Rosita  I have wondered -
I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
Hey  I'm over here.
Well, I'd best be off.
It's about the leopard.
That's right, of course.
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
You know Charlie How-Come?
Come to look around?
About Charlie's leopard?
Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.
It was you, Galbraith!
No.
It was you.
It's better you don't know.
That was unfortunate.
I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -
That's why it just mauls and tears at them.
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
Yes. The lipstick.
You're too good to me.
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
Are you all right?
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
What did he have to do - look at the body?
	As long as my feet held out.
I know. Funerals.
Maybe I want to feel badly.
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
I got into a little crap game.
Eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways 
I hated you that day - you and your flip talk - with that little girl lying dead.
Aint nobody out there, Mister.
Thats right.
Will you please come with me?
Good afternoon. De Moraess residence.
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
I work here, sir. Im here most of the time.
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
Can it be that easy?
I found this at your brothers.
You... You found that at Leons?
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
I cant tell you that yet. But hes being well looked after.
Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
The man who sold the boy to your brother.
Mr Lombard?
Have you got a pen?
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
Paul Lamont...?
Mr Lombard...
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
Im really sorry you were not called...
Black suits you.
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
What do you mean, No, Mrs De Moraes?
One just doesnt... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
I dont.
Good.
Is there anything to understand?
You splendid bastard...
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
And you still havent told me why you sent me after Friedman.
I didnt know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
Something like that.
Something like that?
Here we go again.
Where is that?
Simplify and damn.
Dont you believe in simplicity?
So you did talk about it, huh?
What do you suggest?
I dont know. Everyones dead...
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
Crow what?
May I ask where youre from, Mr Lamont?
Europe...  France. Im French but I live in London...  ... England.
You wouldnt have a cigarette, would you?
Youre sure you wont sit down, Miss Stewart?
By your Austrian?
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
Thank you. But I think Ill go to bed. Its been a long day.
Were both thinking the same thing, right?
Damn it! You cant fucking walk away from this!
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
Im calling about the puppies.
Why?
Yes... Good, good...
So, what are you looking for?
What about an untrained pup, white...
... Fine. Ill go for the safe place.
On the bed!
Where is the Austrian?
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
Yes. Friedmans the fuckin Austrian!
Whos the money man?
Ever seen him before?
Yeah... The Diplomat.
Where?
What?
Where are we?
Where are the kids?
And who does Friedman work for?
How many of you scumbags are here?
B-Black...
Where is it?
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
You sure you passed on my message?
How are you, Jane?
I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
So you havent seen the film, then?
Shes pretty... See you, huh?
Carlos De Moraes?
Yes. How did...
I hope its not too significant.
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
I didnt mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
The £1,000 is on account.
£10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
What happens now?
Vous êtes Français?
Problems?
Is my money in there?
Am I supposed to know him?
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
No. In Hampstead... Why?
This car needs petrol.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Huh... Im sure thered be lots of takers.
What is?
Trying to say something, Martin?
Hyatt... Friedmans... at the Hyatt...
At what time will you be available?
Three oclock.
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
Its wet. Will this do?
Wheres your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
Shut up! Wheres your wallet?
A private investigator... Youre not Austrian?
Whats a French private investigator doing here?
We didnt quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
Do you know Leons parents names?
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Whats the date?
The nineteenth... How come you didnt know?
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
Hows the boy doing?
Los Angeles?
Welcome to the club.
No shit... Well, Im afraid I cant help you.
I take it you dont know where he is, then?
What about his girlfriend?
Quest-ce que tu veux?
Cinq cents.
Où est passé ton salon?
Okay, shitbag. Im only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Five seconds. Then you die.
Fuck...
Three...
The acid bath?
Huh! You turned him into a liability, didnt you know?
If he had, youd be dead.
So why didnt he?
Try again, and this time be polite.
When they realise Im missing...
Mossad?
Cost what?
Costliest!
Whats that? A word?
Very funny. Can I go on now?
That's a good idea, sire.
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
Of course I am, it's just that...
I would like some fresh straw.
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
Now?
He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
What did they say?
What's going on?!
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
Well...
I'll go.
Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
I don't know it.  I feel it.
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
But it is what I want.
Will you at least let me stay with you?
We must sound the retreat!
But... why... what's the point?
Do as I say!
I want to stay with you...
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
I -- I don't understand...
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
Jeanne's alive!
We have to press home the attack!
Sound the retreat...
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
I tried to.
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
Do you have a sword?
Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?
Why?
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
And when was that?
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
W-w-what are you doing?!
What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
Am I... am I dead?
Dead you're worthless, darling.
Where... where am I?
God defeated the English, not me.
Quick -- hide in here...
Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!
But where are you going to be?
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
In a village called Domremy.
How old are you?
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
Not long ago...
Yes.
What did it tell you?
Please... may I have it back...
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
He's feeling wonderful.
Thanks be to God.
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
If there was, I didn't see it...
His face.
Does he have hair?
5,000 gold crowns.
8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
Good.  Where are the English?
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
Wait, wait...
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
The wind will be against us...
What's going on?
Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...
Stand by with the battering-rams...
We need another ten minutes...
Well...?  Shall we go?
Not yet.
Yes.  We can pray.
This is no good!
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
But the bridge has been pulled down!
Clear?
You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?
Jeanne... we're not enough...
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Jeanne, look behind you.
Do you know how to count?
Who told you to wear men's clothes?
Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
Stop it!  What are you doing?
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
Why not?  He has good teeth...
Yeah...
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
Prepare these as battering-rams!
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
Yes... a half-steed... white.
Who gave you that horse?
How many did he give you?
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
Jeanne... what are you doing?
What have you done to me?
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
What are you doing out here?
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
Yes!
They're going to come and visit you in here?
Why not?
They won't come anyway.
What do you mean, they won't come?
Yes... lots of things!
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
No.  That was a sword in a field.
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
What are you doing on the wall?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
Are you going to leave me too?
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
You think you are ready now?
Yes, my lord.
But you already confessed this morning...
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
Whose were they?
My father's.
Oh yes... very.
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
So... everything sounds... wonderful?
Who is this "he"?
He never says his name.
Why did she have to die?
Jeanne, be patient.
I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
Someone you know?
I'm going to get a doctor.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
Wladek, please.
Don't worry, it won't last long.
Wladyslaw Szpilman.
Dorota.
I need help.
He'll be back before curfew.
How long have you been married?
And how's Yurek?
What did I tell you?
Will I still be able to play?
It's not going to be very comfortable.
I'm on the run!
Have you seen this?
Calm down, what, what is it?
Halina?
What?
Funny time to say this.
What?
wish I knew you better.
Henryk's in there.
Tough luck.
Can you help us?
It costs.
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
And suppose they take the table away?
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
They bombed us, we're off the air.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
That makes a change.
A good place for what?  He's insane!
You sell anything?
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
I can look after myself!
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
Otherwise what?
Very appropriate.
No one thought they'd hold out so long.
So, what's the news?
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
Why didn't you come to me?
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Can you help? I've no money...
Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
Wladek! How are you?
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
Cow!
Pig!
Bitch!
Dirty pig!
You're a dirty pig!
I was listening, Kitten.
How long have you been here?
Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
It's a little cut, nothing.
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
Where are we going?
Out of Warsaw.
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
What the hell are you doing?
What's your work?
I am... I was a pianist.
In the attic.
What's happening?
Are the Russians here?
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
Watch your feet!
Careful! Watch his hand.
To be deaf?
Yes, like a cave.
No sound at all?
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
My REAL father was a famous German composer
I thought she met your father in Luxemburg.
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
Which mountains are those dear?
The Alps.
Well, that is a strong opinion.
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
She looks tired.
What's he say?
They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?
On your property?
I'd like to make a swap.
What for?
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
I don't want to learn.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
You mean in signs?
No, words. You have never heard words?
You have to wash them.
She wants to see what you can do.
Everyone has to practice.
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?
What did she say?
She says, throw the piano overboard.
What's in here then, lead?
It's my mother's piano.
Oh no, it can't come now.
Hello, then.
You've missed this bit.
Play a gig.
Do I know any gigs?
You the owner here?
That's right.
All right if I look around your lobby?
Which way are the rooms?
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
7 to 2.  That ain't bad.
You wanted by the law or somethin'?
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'. 
How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
What do we do?
No.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
Twist, you know this guy?
You're late.  Where you been?
I had some appointments.
How much did ya lose?
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
You think my play is bad?
I'm out, Johnny.
If that's the way you want it.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
Wasn't no problem a mine.
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
Which one?
What about the other one?
They're still looking for him.
Who's got the contract?
Yes sir.
I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.
I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.
Been a while since I stocked a wire store.  Not many mobs playing that anymore.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
You sober?
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw.
You mean you blew it.
I picked something up on the way.
Lonnegan after you, too?
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
I'll take him anyway.
You just worry about your end, kid.
How'd ya do?
Everything go all right?
No signs of trouble?
And?
You think he'll show?
No.
Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
It was too noisy.
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
Henry.
You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
You wanta wait for your share?
The wire is ten years outa date.
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
Raise 500.
See ya and raise three.
See and raise five.
Raise 300.
Raise 1,000.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
Who are you?
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
2:00 A.M.
You doin' anything tonight?
You got a back door to this place?
What does this guy want?
Looks like he missed ya.
You sure it'll be one of these two?
Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me. He wants to see you a second.
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
Hooker!
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
Yeh, he knows that.
So could Shaw.
You're dreamin', kid.
660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
You should always look to the back too, kid.
And you were gonna pay me back?
You really picked a winner, kid.
Well, what did I tell ya?
Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.
You stayin' in or not?
You got the 400 grand yet?
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
Let me talk to him.
How am I gonna do that?
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
I don't know.  He took it hard.
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
Do ya know him or don't ya?
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
What about this Rosebreen?
He was?
Then just say he was sixty years old.
Is that what it means?
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
Cheer up, darling.
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
Now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.
Any luck?
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
Why did that man want to kill him?
Said he stole his invention.
What?
Nothing.
How are you?
Mind if I look around?
Oh, Andy.
And don't ever try to see me again.
What are you talking about?
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
You're talking like a crazy person,
Give it to me.
What is it?
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
Don't.  It's horrible.
I didn't.
You hand that over to the police.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
Oh!
Mother!
Is your father still in there?
He's waiting for you.
He didn't do it -- Nick!
Another Martini --
You know, we know each other.
Aren't you Nick Charles?
Not that scrawny little....? 
Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He worked on a case for father.
Macaulay.
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
tried him once -
How do you do?  I'm sorry we have to rush.
Come on in.
You heard about Julia Wolf?
Yes.
Where did you hit her?
She fell down.
I don't know.
Which way did she fall?
Where did you get this gun?
I bought it in a pawn shop.
Don't lie to me.
It's been the same one for three months.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
What would your mother say to that?
He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
How's your brother?
I'd like to see him.  Why don't you bring him down?
I know -- I know --
And he still wants to marry me!
Only in bad weather.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Better get home before it is.
You can take that out to the car.
Not at all.
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
Not a thing.
Did you kill her?
Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
Yes.  I might not have been shot.
I never saw him before.
What's he want of you?
What's that to you?
What'd he think it was to you?
Ask him.  I don't know.
I'm asking you.
Not without a warrant.
This gun yours?
No.
Who's is it?
No proof?
No.
He's holding out on you.
Well, what'd you think?
I think we're on the right track.
Trail him!  Trail who?
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
What're you doing here?
Are you kidding?
You mean that body-----?
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
I said he hadn't written me.
Well....
Well, what?
When was that?
About three.
Did you go?
I didn't know they had a fight.
That's ridiculous.
Good morning --
I think we may as well sit down.
Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.
Chris!
All right.  All right.
I couldn't go near that woman.
What are you going to do?
Just what I said I'd do.
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
We're just having a little drink.
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
You're going to return every cent of it!
I can't! I haven't got it!
What did you do with the rest?
Oh, he's sitting up.
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
I got word from Wynant this morning...
Did you get my money?
But suppose some business comes up...
One hundred...  two hundred... three...
Thanks, and goodbye.
What'll I do if something comes up?
Is Julia going with you?
But what if you need more money?
How are you?
Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
I have no right to answer that.
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Dorothy!  Is she here?
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
They'll want more than your word for that.
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
Nobody told me.  I did see him!
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
I've never heard about you.
I didn't knock Julia off.
What's that?
Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?
Why do you say that?
So it's you he was after!
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
You might have mentioned me first.
Pretty girl.
If you like 'em like that.
Much better, thanks.
How many drinks have you had?
What hit me?
Who's that?
Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.
Isn't that my drink?
What are you drinking?
She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.
She didn't tell me a thing.
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
Can't you get to sleep?
Maybe a drink would help you.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
They were kidding you.
I'd like to see you work.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
Nick!  Nick!  There's someone to she you,
It's all right.  It just grazed me.
Someone get a doctor.
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
Want a drink?
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
I never saw that before.
Who gave it to you?
Hello... send him up.
Who's that?
Aren't you hot in that?
Is that another Christmas present?
Let's see.  Where's it from?
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Your guess is as good as mine.
Oh, it's a fire hydrant.
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!
You talk as if I were Asta.
What's the trouble, Asta?  Your balloon busted?  So's mine.
Maybe I will.
But Wynant --- ?
I don't believe he did it.
So am I.
He's just been for a walk.
Looks like a hold-up!
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
Not with all your money!
You dog!
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
What do you mean?
It was his body that was buried there.
That's a fact.
Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
Well, don't they?
Couple of months anyway.
Smart gal.
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
I'm going to tell her.
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
Yes!
Got a nice evening dress?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
The suspects!  They won't come.
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations. 
Mimi...
Mimi!
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
I wish you'd tell me who.
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
Is that true?
I don't know.
Why are you saying it?
It's the only way it makes sense.
No, Mr. Charles.
Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
Nick Charles here?
You his wife?
Bonds, sir?
I know I left them there.
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
I'm sorry...  but...
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
Home?
Who fired you?
Where were you going?
What's in the other direction?
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
Paper.
It's a map, I think that's what it is.
Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.
What are we going to do!?
They stopped.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
We've got rope?
For climbing.
Ready?
All right.  Let's get out of here.
The US Army:  Always an adventure.
What do you figure it to be?
Missile!
Epps!
What about the gold?
What about it?
You're the one with all the ideas.
You don't know that.
You're out of your mind.
He's an enemy soldier.
I've got no stomach for murder.
Then step aside.
No.
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
I'm the one's got the big stick.
Just keep quiet.
I have to answer him.
So you can give us away?
At-at-at-at-at.
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
There might be something in there.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
Now this is war.
But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.
You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
Invest it.
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
Take the binoculars.
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
They're not going to--
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
She okay?
Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
It'd make their heads explode.
What do we do with the Humvee?
SAY IT!
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
What!?
What?
You didn't step on any mine.
Oh, God!  Oh God!
Just be cool.
It's a mine, isn't it?
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
There's a way.
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
This.  Whatever it is.
I don't hear any--
Don't!
Iraqis.  A bunch of them.
X marks the spot.
Where is it?  Where'd it go?
Stay low.
Where the hell is it!?
We're not going to do anything.
They're going to kill us!
A whole lot of nothing.
What are you doing?
It's just a mongoose.
Is it dead?
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
We'll find our way.
How!?
Forget Wes.
We can't just leave him.
What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
We'll lie.
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
I'm sorry about that, Epps.
Epps?
Yeah.
I don't want to die.
Sorry.
Wonder how the war's going?
I pick that way.
It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
Well?
Well, we should identify ourselves.
Slip out your M-16.
And then what?
Can't you--
What do you make of them?
Shi'ites, I think.
Is that good, or bad?
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
Why haven't they killed us!?
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
With what?  Against how many?
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
I didn't say that.  I never said--
Which way do we go!?
Damn it.  We lost the horses.
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
Epps.
Epps?
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.
He's not slowing.
Woods.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
Just...want to be ready when we do.
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.
Spanish wasn't hard enough?
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
What is this?
He says it's a box.
You get it yet?
Naw, nothing.
Jaeger?
That's in two days.
Jaeger?
What!?
Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
Epps, is that a sand dune.
If!  If there's a treasure.
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
If there's gold.  If!
Iraqis.
I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
Yeah, well, we're not.
You have to go with us, Wes.
Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
How long we going to keep this up.
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
Is there anything you do know?
So?
We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
Think we can make it?
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
What do you think?
You down?
Yeah, we're down.
Maybe we should give him some water.
All last night he could have been--
I think he wants something to drink.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
Stress category.
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
Drug evasion with....
triple three, triple three! easy.....
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
Permant cortex bond.
HUMMMM.....
Hurry up.
4732...?
Vocasity
What's this?  Why did you change it?
When?
He wants me to come to his quarters.
I don't know.
I haven't done anything.
Look, food!
That's not food.  Can't be food.
Don't take anything.
What are you doing here?  Is anything wrong?
What are you doing?
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
Are you all right?
They don't know.
It's the end.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
THX!
We're leaving.
What?
Who?  Who's leaving?
THX and me.
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
I can't see him at all.  He's been destroyed.
How far did you go?  Was it cold?
I've got it!  Astounding!
Where is LUH?
Why did you have LUH come here?
Why are you so concerned?
What's going on?
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
When?.....How?
Right now.
What?
What are you doing here?
I was lost.
...and you're not lost now?
Which way?
How do you know?
We've lost SEN!
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.
Who?  Me?...I don't know.
Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.
I knew him.
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
No......  She's dead THX........
Remember this...?
Where's LUH?
I'm sorry.
What do you want?
Just look at all those people.
Yes.
May I help you?
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
They're not here.
Where are they?
And you are...?
Hey, that's the guy-
Coffee, Mike?
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
Aren't you on suspension?
Just do it.
Who the heck're you?
Where did you get this?
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
Treat. We treat devices.
Anything else I should know?
Only once, at Redstone.
Oh yeah? Prove it.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
How long are we going to stay?
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
Ex-girlfriend?
What's up?
Driving in circles, waiting for-
Should we head for the Interstate?
Fuck factor?
Talk to me. Let's assess.
Good, now the other side.
Nothing.
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
More metal... sharp edge...
Which one's which?
I don't know.
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
What do you think?
Whadaya mean?
It's from an IRA.
You got it.
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
C4, plastic explosive.
Computer device?
Lane oil...
What do ay say?
Alright!
Jesus...
Thank you.
Alex-
What is that?
What's the matter?
No... No more killing.
Stay here.
Who are you calling, sis?
Alex, please-
Drop it.
What the hell was that?
Prints?
Nothing so far.
I'm filing charges against that mother-
He is!
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
How're you guys doing?
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
Pooch, can you move it?
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
Fuckin A, I think I got two partial prints here!
Oh shit...
Look who's talking, old man.
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
What was it this time?
Mike...
It don't work-
Make an appointment.
P.E.T.N ...
Vice cop on a homicide?
Device.
Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.
T.J., what're you doing?
So what're we looking for?
Nice to be here.
I'll do it.
Sir...
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
I promised her she'd be safe.
It's our only option.
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-
Yes.
And diamonds in the front.
Yes.
Diamonds all over.
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
With the compliments of Colet and Company!
No!
What did you talk about?
About tonsils.
Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the feeling we have met somewhere before.
I wanted to say goodbye to you.
No.
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
Amsterdam?
Constantinople?
No.
You've never been in Constantinople?
And harems ... ?
Nice day, Major.
Umm.
No doubt about it--it's that secretary.
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
Nice suit.
Like it?
Smart. London, eh?
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
He's really not a bad fellow.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?
I would start with cocktails.
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
I want to see-- 
Yes, Baron.
And as for you, waiter--
I don't want to see you at all!
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
You can trust me.
I hope you find the figures correct.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
Two weeks and three days.
Um-hum!
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
I've got to see you.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
Otherwise I'll call the police
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
What do you mean?
You say I am a crook.
M'sieu ...
Monescu.
M'sieu Monescu!
Just as you say, Doctor.
Thank you, Major. 
Now just a minute, Major--
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
Disappointed?
Please.
Thank you.
The pepper, too?
Monescu!
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...
Right.
Sweetheart, what day is today?
We'll take the Royal Suite!
What?
Certainly!
Five, seven, and nine--
Spanish passports?
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
What time is your rendezvous?
Now, Lily--
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
Lily, you must listen to me.
And you--
Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company! 
I remember.
You like that statue?
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 
Oh! You didn't read it!
Naturally I did.
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
Too much blue in crimson.
What shade of powder do you use?
Peaches and cream.
That's too dark.
What?
Make it out to cash!
Eighteenth century.
Right!
I see.  She must have been very happy here.
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
Then I mislay my checkbook--
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
The same thing.
I'll be delighted.
Then riding together.
Um-hum ...
Then lunch in the Bois--
Together.
Then a little nap--
Beautiful.
Hair?
Marvelous.
Crimson!
Correct!  Good night.
Good night. 
Good night.
Talk? About me--about us?
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
Yes, I would!
Like that?
Like that!
I know all your tricks.
And you're going to fall for them.
So you think you can get me?
Any minute I want!
You're conceited--
But attractive--
I <u>must</u> go.
I'm crazy about you!
I know it.
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
I <u>believe</u> you.
Then why do you want to go?
On the night table.
Thirty-three--
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
Call the police?
You look beautiful.
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Mariette!
<u>Adolph</u>?
Adolph J. Giron.
And you expect me to believe that?
Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.
Goodbye...
Goodbye.
It could have been marvelous ...
Lovely.
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
Yes, Madame Colet?
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Oh, no, it's the way you lead.
No, m'sieu!
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
Two lumps, madame?
Please!  Thank you.
Well--uh--yes and no.
To me he seems rather nervous.
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
Yes, madame?
I think you'd better go.
Ever had a romance with a crook?
He started it.
But you're the more intelligent one.
That's true.
Then why did you do it?
Your bag?
Yes, my bag!
Didn't you take it with you?
No--I'm sorry.
But you saw it here.
Yes, I saw it--but--
How much time?
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
Good luck to you, Rose.
I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.
Who's the best? Say it.
We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here...
Holy shit.
Rose Calvert.
None of the stewards have seen her.
The one on the other side is letting men in.
Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth.  Mind your step.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
My God... Cal. Is it a --
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
But I was with him the whole time.
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
Is this in any way unclear?
What do I tell your mother?
You're precious to me, Rose.
Sure. Count me in.
This should be amusing.
Just a soupcon of lemon...  ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
Bollocks.
Cor... look at that, would ya.
The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.
Why have we stopped?
How cold?
Ever been to Wisconsin?
I'm Jack Dawson.
Could I speak to you in private?
So, you got a name by the way?
Mr. Dawson, I --
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
Is he your boyfriend?
Yes, exactly!
If only it were that simple.
What's this?
Just some sketches.
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
No, no! Just with her hands.
And...?
May I cut in, miss?
I don't know the steps.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
Where to, Miss?
You're trembling.
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
You have to go for help.
I'll be right back.
Will this work?
I'm not going without you.
You jump, I jump, right?
I promise.
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
You think she was really there?
Would you like anything?
It's been 84 years...
Don't come any closer.
My God, Rose, what's gotten into --
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
Rose, get in the boat!
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
Do you want the truth, Anya?
It would be a nice change from you.
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
Hope we're not intruding.
Well--shall we go into dinner?
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
Good afternoon--
I hope so.
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
Will you pardon me?
Did you find it?
No-o!
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
What did you want a gun for?
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Guess again, copper.
Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
Could I see you a minute?
I'm so sorry!
I'll say she is!
Nice lines--
Very much--
You've got lipstick all over you.
--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
So you washed it off!
How about giving me another coat?
Good-by!
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
Never eat before the show.
This is Mr.--er--
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
Isn't she attractive?
Very--your mother?
Don't be a c-a-t.
Yes?
Well, I can't.
Don't rub it in.
When?
At seven-thirty?
Sooner it you like.
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
A little.
Sorry.
What are you thinking?
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
You mean that?
Don't let's talk about it.
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
Good night, Mrs. Brett!
I could see you were pining away--
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
Make it five.
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
Well, I'll be--!!!
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
Nix, the law!
Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
How're the tips?
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
No, sir?
My change.
Shortie!--you know my motto?
Inspector McKinney.
Thank you, sir. 
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
About sixteen hundred.
You keep it-- 
<U>Me</U>!
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Where did you hide it?
On the drunk.
Come in! 
It's your deal.
How's your mother feeling?
Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
I thought you were a sucker--
I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
Oh, yes. On the pier.
I'm going to the show--
Care to join us?
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
Sure, I'll go.
I'll go with you.
It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice.
Hello, young fellow!
Here's your fifty.
No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
That's too bad.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
Here you are, sir. 
Where do you live?
In New York.
Back is in New York.
Sure.
I'll say--how fast is this boat going?
Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
No. <U>Knots</U>!
What?
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
Yes--Me--in person!
I can see where I won't talk much to you.
Well, did you find me?
McKinney's the name.
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Is this your gun?
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
I don't get the humor of that remark.
Yes.
Very serious?
Why--don't you like him?
Meaning what?
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
Somebody's got to do it--
What's the matter, Mary?
I'm getting seasick--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
What's he got that I haven't got?
--And he has sex appeal.
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
That's him! That's the sucker!!
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
How much did you lose?
About twelve hundred.
He's all right.
Thanks to me.
Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
Congratulations.
Say, "Thanks very much!"
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
That's the truth--every single word!
I sincerely hope so--
Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
There you are, sir.
Thank you.
He's certainly good-natured.
I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
Sure, Sis.
I was in his cabin--
What!--are you crazy?
Nothin'.
Let me look at it.
I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Then why did you run away?
I said that's 500 to you, Holliday.  In or out?
God damn son of a...
Oh, my God...

You'll never make that stick.
Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.
Virgil?
See what I mean about it getting Spooky?
I appreciate your assistance, M. But this is now a military operation.
It's too late -
Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.
I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
...And what's that, my dear?
- Instant melt-down.
...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.
Where can I find him?
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
Your new car. 
...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there.
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
Paris?!? What are you doing here?
Is that any way to say hello?
Is this another one of your games?
Do you feel better now?
Shhhhh...
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
It must do something.
How is old Q?
Gone fishing.
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
Hey - the world is my office.
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
Something with an engine? Not oars?
I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.
Natalya?
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
She married a hockey player.
I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
Can you arrange a meeting?
Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -  What happened?
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
I got you covered.
Interesting video tape.
... Does this do anything?
... Kids?
Three. You? Married?
No.
Thanks.  Take care -
Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
Nice to run into you again.
I hope you'll be gentle.
And what do you call this?
If I were you -
Why don't we just take these -
You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
Blood or Dutch?
He's killed closer.
Wait here.
... How did you get into marine salvage?
Not a lot of difference.
Down?
Sometimes you just have to -
Sleep well?
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
And when might that be?
Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?
- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -
... What's Harmsway done?
...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
What do you make of all this?
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
I was just getting to the interesting part!
Sakwa!
Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.
Who's in charge here?
What's your name?
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
Pencil it in for the next trip -
Damn. It's doing it again.
How is it now?
What is HE doing here?
Obviously, the British government denies all of this -
...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
How sweet.
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
Approaching the first gate.
Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!
Take the men. I can finish alone.
Is the helicopter ready?
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?
What the hell is going on?
It's Bond!
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
What about ID's?
Oh, no.
Who is it?
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
I don't know. He's not in the database -
Will it go off?
Maybe. Maybe not.
Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.
I pay my own way.
What did your wife get her?
Junior spends time with his child.
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
What is a sip of coffee going to do?
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
Like a veil has been lifted?
Do you think you won?
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
Who is it?
I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.
Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?
What for?
I'm going back home with Harry.
I could swear I heard my son call me.
You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
Well, you just have to move further out.
Now how far would further out be?
Your feet are cold.
I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.
You all act like two roosters.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
Hush.
You're always taking his side.
I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.
No, I'm too hot now.
I'm worn out.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
It's good to be able to hear that.
You must have been really sick.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
What, are you having another party?
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
Since this morning.
What happened to your hand?
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
Everything these days is made overseas.
Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.
How is everybody?
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
Let me get you a cup?
Good afternoon, ladies.
You must have done something to her.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
Those boys never did have good luck.
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
How many people do you all feed?
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
None of your business.
Is this your house?
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.
No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.
When did you talk to Harry?
What are you doing?
I was just trying to make conversation.
He is in his pigeon cage.
I'm sorry he got those birds.
I didn't mean for you to pay me for that.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
Wow!  Cool!
Whadda ya think?
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Can I bring some toys?
You can bring ONE toy...
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
Can I help pump the gas?
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Next stop...
Mom, have you seen Woody?
Where was the last place you left him?
Everybody say, "Bye, house."
Hey!  Wow!
What?  What is it?
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
Which one can I open first?
We're almost there.
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Hello-o-o...
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
Toy?
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
No, you can't.
You can't!
Can!
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
You're mocking me, aren't you?
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
That's why.  Sid.
Sure is a hairy fellah.
THAT is Sid!
According to my nava-computer, the --
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
Ow!  Watch where you're going!
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Woody, we don't know what's out there!
It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Woody, stop it!!
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Oh, I'm a sham!!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
Come on, this way!
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Shhhhhhh!
What?!
I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
Well, thanks for the ride.
Great!
Woody!  The rocket!
Woody?!  What are you doing?
Ha-ha!!
Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Hi!
Hey, watch it!
Let's string him up by his pull- string!
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
Heh-heh.
Are you peeking?
No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!
Son of a building block, it's Woody!
Oh, that is disgusting.
I dunno.
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
I don't know!
Oh no, Hannah!
What?
Hey!!
She's sick!
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
Aa-a-a-a-ah! 
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
A lunchbox?!
Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...
Who is it this time?
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
No!  No, no, no, no!
Toss 'im overboard!
ROOAAAARR!!!
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.  This is serious!!
Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
What the heck is up there?
We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
I got it, Woody!
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
Sir!  No Sir!
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.
Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?
This is ludicrous.
Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!
Reach for the sky!!
Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
W-w-w-we?
Hey, Slinky?
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
Bad news?!
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
I can't hold on much longer!
You'll put your clothes here.
I like plaits.
Curled up on the landing like love locked out!
I did like the music.
Is there anything else I should know about him?
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
She's not accustomed to being ignored.
She'll have to learn.
What was <i>that</i> in aid of?
Go away.
Do what?  Oh, I see.
You're only a young thing.
You're not so old yourself!
Who's there?
Well ... yes. All right. But -
Finn -
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?
I finished it off.
He'll murder you when he finds out.
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
Stop it!
Finn ...
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
Did you now.
How long has -
I already lost everything once.
So had I.
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
Did you do this?
You're well built; how old are you?
I... I don't really know.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want?
I can't find Manolo.
How much?
What is he planning on telling them?
I want to believe you.  I really do.
Helena, I'm so sorry --
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
How much do I pay him?
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.
Don't bother.
Carl, that's insane.
Carl --
I think she's lying.
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
This is different.
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
About the other night, I'm sorry.
My Leica's gone.
So's the video camera.
Did you meet the President?
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
Did you tell Dad?
Not yet.
Are you going to?
I don't know.
Is this bad for him?
Hi.
Hi.
Just watching you.
You all right?
What if every country legalized at the same time?
I don't know.
Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?
Okay, young lady, that's it.
You can't make me.
...How old are you?
Sixteen
Live with your parents?
Yes.
Yes.
In school?
Private?
Yeah.
How are your grades?
I'm third in my class.
What's that mean?
I get A's.  All A's.
What are you doing?
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
What is this, like freebase?
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
Have you done your homework, honey?
Yes, mom --
That's a big word for a fisherman.
I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
She knows Arnie Metzger.
So does half of San Diego.
He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you.
What do we do?
What do you think she wants?
Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?
What do you think it is?
Depends who it's from.
Depends on the state.
David --
I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
Yes, sir!
We aren't barbarians.
I don't know, sir.
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
Wasn't that General Salazar?
Yeah.
Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
Madrigal's alive.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
You should feel good about this.
What's your name?
What is the name of your informant?
If I can.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
What is it you want me to do?
Does this offer include my partner?
Only if he can be trusted.
I'm aware of that.
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
I have money --
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
She's not at that place you sent her?
Oh, man --
Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?
You won't say anything to my parents?
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
Hey man, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to help.
Salazar's been taken down.  He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.
Who are these guys?
Who do we interface with on their side?
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
Did you tell him?
Well, I've not brought them.
Well, I've not brought them.
I'm sorry.
Bit fucking late, like.
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
You've stabbed me, man.
For fuck's sake.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
What?
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it.
I'd fucking kill you.
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.
Thanks.
What's your name?
Where are you going, Diane?
I'm going home.
Where's that?
Great.
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
Diane.
Ssshh!
Sorry.
Out.
Jesus.
I don't see why not.
Because it's illegal.
Holding hands?
Calm down. You're not going to jail.
Easy for you to say.
Can I see you again?
What do you want?
Are you clean?
Yes.
Is that a promise, then?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Well, it isn't.
Smells like it.
You're too young.
It's Iggy Pop.
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
Sixteen next month.
So, what's he like?
I read it in Cosmopolitan.
What happened?
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
Oh, really?
Do you recall the school motto?
Of course, the motto, the motto --
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.
Morning, Spud. Sit down and have some breakfast.
I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.
There's no need.
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
Are you getting out much?
No.
Following the game at all?
No.
You take the test?
Aye.
Clear?
Aye.
That's nice.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
Have you got any gear on you?
Good luck, Spud.
Cheers.
Now remember --
Right.
But try too hard --
Exactly.
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
Running time?
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
Director?
Lewis Gilbert.
Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.
OK, so who was it, then?
The park?
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
Who wrote it?
Roald Dahl.
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
What about The Untouchables?
I don't rate that at all.
Despite the Academy award?
Yeah.
That's your theory?
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?
Say something, Mark, say something --
Eughh. Sounds horrible.
It wasn't that bad.
Did he -- you know?
What?
No, he didn't make me touch it.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
He made me lick it.
Cut it out.
When are you going to visit him?
What was your price?
Four Grand.
But you don't have the money?
We're two thousand short.
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
That's hardly a substitute.
you'll need one more hit.
What's on the menu this evening?
Your favourite dish.
Your usual table, sir?
Sounds great, Swanney.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
There.
How's it going with Gail?
No joy yet.
Six weeks.
Where did she come up with that?
Six weeks and no sex?
So what's it going to be?
We go for a walk.
What?
A walk.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
And how did you breach the Barrier?
Then I shall make use of this starship.
He has his doubts...
No, no, it's not possible.
Rescued at last.
My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
Sulu, what are you doing?
Following new course. Warp seven.
In firing position. Torpedo armed.
Shuttle en route.
Position, Bird of Prey?
Raise shields.
But the shuttle-
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
This is the Starship Enterprise.
I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.
Can we have it quiet?
Have the Klingons responded?
No, but you can bet they will.
Your pain runs deep.
Where did you get this power?
Join my quest.
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
Why didn't you beep my communicator?
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
And that is?
Because it's there.
I don't understand.
What are you doing?
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
Jim.
Life is not a dream.
Yes, Captain.
Goodnight, Spock.
I could use a shower.
What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
I cannot be certain.
I do not often think of the past.
To land any closer would risk detection.
Spock.
Yes, Captain?
Be one with the horse.
You must allow us to act.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
I ordered you to defend this ship.
You ordered me to kill my brother.
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
There, you see? See?
I have a half brother.
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
There's got to be a way out of this place.
Is it possible?
I am here, Captain.
New word. "b".. "a"... um...
There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
Hmmm?
It would appear we are too heavy.
Spock.
...mark two.
Spock... don't.
What is this?
Spock?
Spock, I thought I was going to die.
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
Who are you?
We must change our course at once.
Spock...  What have you done to my friends?
Now learn something about yourself.
You are mad!
About the ship...
No special conditions?
What makes you think I won't turn us around?
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...











"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
Sybok, you must surrender.
No. I will not.
Each man's pain is unique.
I hide no pain.
I know you better than that.
Spock?
I cannot go with you.
Why not?
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
Sybok, we must find a way...
I don't get it.
Hi, Alan.
Want one?
I want to go to his place.
You call that getting over it?
What for?
To warn him.
For what?
For being on to Dillinger.
Beautiful!
Come on in...
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
What do you mean, "'yes"?
Oh. Anything else?
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
I'm your program?
Way to go! We're haulin'!
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
This town's full o' live ones.
Yes!
No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show...  What's up?
Flynn?
Cute.
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
Who is your User, program?
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
Where did you hear that name?
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
What's that?
How about over there...that empty memory?
Flynn!!
Greetings, program...
You're alive!
Did we make it?
Hey... you guys OK?
A User -- in our world?
There's another beam!
Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
Flynn... you can't... I
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
You're a..."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.
How 'bout yourself?
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
Watch it!
Feel what? You okay?
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
We have to talk.
So...how's the world of serious science?
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
What do you think?
You think we can make it there?
Do you know what he's talking about?
My quarters.
Why is everything...like this?
You've grown, big program.
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
What is it?
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
We have to get off this beam!
Nice...
It's something Users do.
I'm shocked.
Helen!  It's your mystery man.
Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
Where are you off to young lady?
Dana, are you listening to me?
How was school today?
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.
Why?
Harry!  Where are you!
Harry?  HARRY?!
What a team.  See you at eight.
Thanks dear.
Son of a bitch!
Fourteen, Harry.
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
You want me to just hang-- ?
Just hang a minute.
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
Is this national security stuff boring you?
Put a tap on her phone.
What're you talking about?  We have that.
Guy's a spook!
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
She's still at my house.						*
You tell on me, I tell on you.
We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?
I thought this look like your work.
He's got it.
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
No!  Never!
So, it was your first time.
Well, what's the point of waiting?
Yes.
Yes what?
Oral hygiene?
Did you tell her about us, Harry?
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
I'm late.
That's fabulous Harry.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
I'm sorry.  Thank you for the party.
Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
Uh huh.
They must've just missed me.
Why did you continue to see him?
He needed my help.
You weren't attracted to him at all?
Would you say he was boring, then?
Yes.
I don't know.  I guess I needed something...
Let me out of her!  Right now!
Yes.
Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
You will be contacted with the assignment.
Natasha?
Now slide the nylons off one by one.
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
What were you doing there?
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
Yes.
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
Are we going to die?
I don't take those assignments.
What about Juno?
She's really a fox, isn't she?
No.  But I wanted to.
What is it?
God, you have great legs.
What?
Do you still love me?
As much as you used to?
What are you going to do?
So what's your angle?
Boris and Doris?
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.
Like one?
Tell me what happened?
I'm sorry, I can't.
I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
You'll call me then?
What is it you need me to do?
I don't know.  I have to think...
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
What do you want me to do?
Who is this woman?
His wife.
Did you get the letter?
What letter?
Not yet.
Let me speak to Clarence.
That was so good I am gonna have another.
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.
I didn't get any chicken.
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
Tell him we gotta go.
The letter I sent.
Has he looked through it yet?
Tell him to look through it.
Bye-bye.
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
Want some Goobers?
Thanks a lot.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Is that your real name? Really?
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.
What time is it?
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
I love to get pie after a movie.
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
How 'bout me what?
Tell me about yourself.
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
Ask me them again. One by one.
I don't remember.
What's your favorite movie star?
Like it?
Very much. Now, where were we?
How long have you worked here?
Almost four years.
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.
You know when you sat behind me?
What would make you think that?
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
So he really loved her?
Who and what is a Drexl?
My pimp.
You have a pimp?
Uh-huh.
A real live pimp?
Uh-huh.
What?
Yes.
You better not be fucking teasing me.
Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"?
I do.
Hello, Mrs. Worley.
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
No no no no no no no no no...
Where you goin', honey?
What?
Write down Drexl's address.
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
What?
I think what you did...
What?
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
With a vengeance, I hated them.
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Damn skippy. He like it, too.
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -
So you do eat pussy!
Ain't no man have to eat pussy!
What?
Yeah.
You wanna get unhaunted?
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
You'd really do that?
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
Where the fuck is that bitch?
She's with me.
Who the fuck are you?
Clarence?
You got it.
It's great to hear from you.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
Tomorrow.
Get the fuck outta here!
I'm a married man.
Alabama, could you tell Clar -
Money problems?
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
This shit can't be real.
It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!
Tell me.
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
Elliot.
Elliot what?
Where?
The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
Clarence...
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
Clarence.
Yeah?
In case.
I'd fuck Elvis.
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
Want an animal cracker?
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
What department?
What do you think, eightball?
Where's everybody else?
Elliot.
Yeah?
Don't you?
Say it, goddamn it!
You are the dumbest person in the world.
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
A Norms in Van Nuys.
Why does he trust you?
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
I can, but I don't.
Do you still have friends on the force?
You were a cop.
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
Where'd you come from?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
That was very good.
Sure. No problem.
Could we try it now?
Where'd he come from?
That Vietnam movie?
Uh-huh.
That was a good fuckin' movie.
Sure was.
Do you believe him?
He'll wear a wire?
Not a tiny little vial -
You're no longer an extra -
Or a bit player -
'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -
You do more than try.
You do.
He knows.
He saw the wire.
How's he supposed to see the wire?
We gotta get him outta there.
What was I sayin'?
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
You gotta hold this for me.
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
Just put it in your purse.
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
I'm not wearing a bra.
Put it in your pants.
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Do you live here?
Yeah, I live here.
Sorta room-mates?
Yes.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
Do you know where we can find him?
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Where's that?
We want you to tell us about last night.
Wake up, Cole.
Well?
Him?  You saw that man?
He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out.
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
We're very close!  Because of you!
They forced me to take drugs.
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
Change what?
Do you know why you're here, James.
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
Why not?  Most people have some ID.
I have to go.
A jail?  Prison?
Underground.
I love this air.  This is wonderful air.
What's wonderful about the air, James?
It's so clean.  No germs.
You're afraid of germs?
This is April, right?
July.
Do you know what year it is?
What year is it?
No, 1995 is the past.
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
It's just a shot to calm you.
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
"Never cry wolf!"
My notes.  Observations.  Clues.
They're keeping an eye on me.
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!
James, why don't we...?
Mason???
What's the matter with your leg?
You smell so good.
Give me the gun.
The gun! ... I lost it
I don't understand what we're doing.
I thought I was in...prison again.
Just like that?  You were in prison?
It was?  I didn't...know.
What does this mean to you?
You want me to rob him?
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.
What're you writing?  You a reporter?
What...???
Excuse me -- what did you say?
I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
How did you find me?
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
But you know what's real now?
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle.
You want to go in?  Examine him?
No, thank you.
Nine thirty
Might be tight.
Hey!  You there!
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
I think I've heard that before.
What do you want for free?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
More or less.
You want to make a kiddies bet?
That's my morning's pay.
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
It's nonsense.
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
Can I help you, sir?
Where to?
Out of here.
Where in Mexico would you like--
One way, or round trip?
One way.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
You want somethin'?
You Harlin?
Nope.  Darrell.
Will he be back soon?
You own this place?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
But he's dead.
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
How much time?
Time.
What time is it now?
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Nothing.
Don't look like nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
How much!?
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Two-hundred.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Please, just leave the car alone.
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!
What you want?
It is morning.
I want my car.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Let me have a Beck's.
We ain't got no Beck's.
Yes.  Yes it is.
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.
Who was that on the phone?
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
They look nice.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
What's the matter?
You didn't hear something?
How could I?  I was sleeping.
Jake, what is that?
What does it look like?
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
I'm just going to my car.
Do you have to call me that?
I don't know your real name.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
My cup runneth over, beauti--
It's Grace.
Jesus.
You sure you can manage?
No, I've got it.
Accident.
Thank you, John.
You're welcome, Grace.
I just drove in this morning.
Where you coming from?
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Nice place you got here.
I guess it must.
Where'd you learn to do that?
A medicine man?
Those are white words, not ours.
Like you.
Beautiful?
I have ideas.
You never did answer my question.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
You know what I want.
You love him?
No.
I'm guessing no.
You could just leave him.
I don't know how.
How far is it to California?
Take me with you.
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
What are you talking about?
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
What about us?
I could if I had Jake's money.
Why the hell didn't you do anything?
Where's the safe?
Nothing.  There's no safe under here.
There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.
If you want.
Let's go in the bedroom.
Let's do it here.
To get my car.
Sheriff Potter, please.  I can't go to jail.  I wanted no part of it.
Give him the money.
You heard me.  Count it out.
You killed him!
Jesus, Grace.  Did you have to kill him?
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
Well, nothing.
John!
I think I busted my leg.
I can't make it.  Grace?  Grace!?
John!  Can you hear me?  Are you still there?
Where the hell am I going to go?
John, throw me the keys.
What for?
It's . . . it's locked.
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
No.  I swear it.
And you're not one to lie, are you?
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
I'm her husband.
A lot that means.
What happened to your hand?
Accident.
You've got to be--
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
I'm a solid man.
John Stewart.
Wait a second--
Would you?
Would I what?
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
How do you know if you've never tried?
Good Lord.  What happened to you?
No.
Hungry?
I had a problem getting my car back.
Now what can I do for you?
I was hoping we could talk.
Talk?  About what?
About things.  About your wife.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
I'm not rambling.
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
You meant it.
And what does that make you?
And for that you'd kill Grace?
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
How much could you get?
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
I need thirteen.
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
Is the job done?
No.
You didn't kill her?
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?
You think that's a lot of money?
Yeah, well, me too.
Trouble with the car again?
There's another reason?  It better be good.
I came for Grace.
You came to take my wife from me?
I came to kill her.
Liar.
It's the truth, Jake.
Honest, Toby.  I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.
I want to stay.
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?
What happened to your hand?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
I've had time to get over it.
For what?
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
What the hell are you talking about?
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Not before I settle with you.
Christ, I don't believe this.
Stand up.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Mister!
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
Give it to me!
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
Do you understand me you little fuck?
Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
Why don't you step out of the car, son?
I don't understand what the--
Eh?
Soda.  You got any soda?
No police.
But, Senor--
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
Senor, you need a doctor.
Hey!  You there!
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
I think I've heard that before.
What do you want for free?
...But ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
More or less.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
Christ, I don't believe this!
Stand up.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Mister!
Now, what's this?
Give it to me!
Who the hell is this!?
Who the hell are you?
A lot that means.
You broke my nose!
Accident.
You've got to be--
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
That's a solid name.
I'm a solid man.
An overheated car.
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
California...
Wait a second--
Would I what?
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
How do you know if you've never tried?
What can I do for you, lad?
I was hoping we could talk.
Talk?  About what?
About things.  About your wife.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
You meant it.
How much could you get?
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
I need thirteen.
I guess this is what they call "ironee"? Hunh?
I came for Grace.
Shhh! Liar.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
I've had time to get over it.
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
For what?
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
What the hell are you talking about?
You Harlin?
Harlin around?
Will he be back soon?
You own this place?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
Yeah, I can fix it.
How much time?
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Nothing.
Don't look like nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
How much!?
Hundred-fifty.
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Two-hundred.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Look, Harlin.
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
What you want?
That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Got any cold soda?
Eh?
Soda.  You got any soda?
I call the sheriff.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
I'm just going to my car?
Do you have to call me that?
I don't know your real name.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
I like that about me, beautiful.
It's Grace.
You sure you can manage?
No, I've got it.
What happened to your hand?
Accident.
Thank you, Bobby.
You're welcome, Grace.
I just drove in this morning.
Where you coming from?
What happens when you lose?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Nice place.
I guess it must.
Where'd you learn to do that?
Those are white words, not ours.
What?
Like you.
I have an idea.
You never did answer my question.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
You know what I want.
How do you know he's still not here?
You love him?
No.
I'm guessing no.
You could leave him.
I don't know how.
What's the matter?...Grace?
Nothing.
You'd never understand.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.
What about us?
I thought you couldn't get your car.
I could if I had Jake's money.
The money's right here! Get the key!
Good thinking.  What's all this?
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
I'm not sailing his boat.
You know I thought you'd left me back there.
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
Why?
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own.
Time to go for a walk, Jake.
Bobby? Are you all right?
I busted my leg!
Why's that?
Where ya goin'?
Harlin's.
That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.
Where to?
Out of here.
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
How much?
One way, or round trip?
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
You got a beer?
What kind?
Beck's.
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
Morning Grace.
Who was that on the phone?
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
What's the matter?
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.
Help me, Grace, help...
I want to stay.
Yes?
Is that the entire message?
Wrap it up.
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
How old is Jeb?
Four.
I'll keep it in my office room.
What about Jeb?
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
Is Jeremy okay?
He's asleep.
I don't know. It's been a while.
Do you remember me getting sick?
Not a specific day. What's this about?
When was the last time I wore pink?
I've come to a decision.
Megan?
Yes. Is this David?
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
He's just laying in bed. He's pretty upset. He won't talk.
Yes.
...I think rust.
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.
My turn. What's your favorite song?
What was that?
Think carefully?
What about the game?
Why?
What's he talking about?
In college. A car accident.
I assumed because of the train.
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
Just give me a minute.
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
I thought he was carrying something.
Have you ever tried to develop it?
I have to go now.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
He's kind of a miracle.
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
I think it's be better if I was alone.
Why'd you do that?
What things?
I'm going to work out.
I'll help you.
I mean if you knew karate?
How much did you take off?
How much is it?
All of it.
I see.
I'm not scared.
That's great.
I know now.
YOU WON'T GET HURT...
I'll just shoot him once.
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
Yeah, hello.
Where were you sitting on the train?
Against a window.
In the passenger car?
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
Twelve years.
You and my mother would have a special connection.
I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
Well, go get it then.
Where is it?
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
You... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em?
Where'd you get the money, huh?
You told them cowboys you had it.
Rain's coming.
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
He's coming ain't he?
We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
Nope.
I thought... you was an angel.
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
Oh. How long I been here?
Three days. Are you hungry?
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
Are you really going to kill them?
Oh. Yeah.
You want... a free one.
Yeah, I guess.
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
Books. He's my biographer.
You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
Those cowboys messin' him up?
You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
Yup.
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
That much, huh?
You could run off them two cowboys.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
Like I said, I...
What's your name?
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?
He's... he's dead.
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
N-no, sir?
I could of... easy.
Oh.
Well, how about it?
She's passed on, Kid.
Finish him, Ned.
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
Better re-load it.
You missed him? You didn't...?
They takin' water?
When we gonna double back?
It's gonna get riper yet.
You still think he's in there?
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
Is it him?
Did... you... get... him?
Cover me, Kid, while I mount.
I can't see 'em.
First one what?
First one I ever killed.
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
Wha... what f-for?
Lemmee see it.
You... gonna take... the money?
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
I... I... think I'm... shot.
You sure you ain't armed?
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
We ain't bad men no more, Bill. Hell, we're farmers.
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
How long you gonna be, Bill?
Two weeks, I guess.
He musta been movin' right along.
You ain't like that no more.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
Some fucker's shootin' at us.
Yeah.
Beats the hell out of me.
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
HEY.
You're marking us, Bill.
HEY, KID.
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
Shit.
Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
You... you remember Eagle Hendershot?
Huh? Uh... yeah.
I seen him.
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
I seen her... I seen Claudia too...
Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
You want the Spencer, Bill? 
What is it, son?
Who's he?
Three.
That fella come by... Tom.
Did I what?
All that money... I mean... did you...?
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
No... I meant...
What?
K-k-kill somebody?
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
More.
See that scrub oak yonder?
Fuck you.
He's blind, for Chri...
Say, Ned... ?
How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
Jesus.  You done this before?
His pistol must of jammed.
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
Maybe.
Well, suppose he does?
We'll bury him.
An' if I spot 'em?
Yeah?
Who ?
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
They'll never stop.
I love you.
They ruined me tonight.
Come home, Dean.
I know who he is.
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.
Then who goes?
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
Why don't you just calm down'
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
What are we gonna do?
Did you hear what he just said?
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
What the hell do you want?
Get out.
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
I was out of line.
You okay?
I'11 be alright.
Well, I'm sorry.
Three million?
What is this?
What-are they speaking?
What if I
Let's say for example -
with what?
Who's your boss?
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
You're lying.
A little of both.
Get a grip. I didn't know.
Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
When does he post bail?
Two hours, tops.
He won't go into the interrogation room.
Someplace else, then.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
I'11 find him.
What?
I know he was good.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
You know Ruby is in Attica?
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.
Is he the one that killed Keaton?
So this lawyer...
Kobayashi.
Came from Redfoot.
I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
You're stalling, Verbal.
Give a guy a break, huh?
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING .
No...
Keaton was Keyser Soze
You're not safe on your own.
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
You're joking.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Mr. Abraham...
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
What did he find?
Nothing.
How good's your intelligence?
Four cases in three years ...
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
How did you settle on the amount?
We thought it was just.
You thought it was just.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
And no one will know the truth.
... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ...
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
... he wants to testify ...?
This is going to drive the ante up.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
They want to settle.    It means a lot of money.
No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Yes.
Say it.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
Anything special about the case?
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
We went to Code Blue...
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Well, many reasons, actually...
Tell me one?
That's right.
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
Ed Concannon.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
Just as you are, Sir...
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
No.
Neurology?
No.
Orthopedics?
I'm just an M.D.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I know of him.
Through, through his book.
What book is that?
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
...of Anesthesiology?
`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
How old are you?
I am seventy-four years old.
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
I did.
Mr. Concannon...?
Nothing further, your Honor.
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
I wouldn't do it.
You would not...?
Yes.
Just now...
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
I thought I would need it.
I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
I completely understand ...
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
I am seventy-four years old.
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
She getting good care over there?
'Code Blue'...
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
The Doctors were not negligent.
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
I didn't do too well for you.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
I.  Yes.  It is.
And you wrote that...
Dr. Gruber ...
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
Yes.
Her doctors killed her.
Well, well, when can we meet again. I'd like to get a deposition..
Thank you ...
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
I've got nothing to say to you.
You know what happened.
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
I didn't do it, Mister.
Who are you protecting, then?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
Then why don't you testify?
Yessir.  I'm sorry.
What is it?
Thank you for seeing me.
I need an extension for my case.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Ready, your Honor.
Nothing further, your Honor...
I object, your Honor...
Overruled...
Continental Casualty...
Mr. Galvin's...
Hello, I'm calling from...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
From the magazine?
How come you're calling me from...?
This is Miss Costello...?
Yes.  Price...
Pardon?
Kathy Price.
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
D'you find an apartment?
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
Why?
The TV didn't work.
What Hotel are you staying at?
And what are you?  A cop?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Really.  How wonderful for you.
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
Maybe what?
What...?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
I've got to work...
Do you want me to go...?
Why don't you get some rest?
You're going to stay here...?
Do you think it's my fault?
You're talking like a drunk.
And it's over...?
Well, then what are you doing here?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Is there going to be a later...?
Not if you don't grow up...
Joe...  Joe...
You're pressuring yourself...
What are you going to do?
Dr. Gruber.
He's not in, Sir.
I have to talk to you.
What do you want?
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
Are you out of your mind...?
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
Right.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
You got a good memory, Franky.
Jimmy?  Bushmills.   Lookit, do me a favor.  I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
What happened, Joey...?
I can't talk now.
Yeah?  How's our new witness?
How are you holding up?
You use their witness.
Are you with me...are you awake...?
Yeah.  I'm awake.
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
Uh...the admitting nurse...
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
The broad has disappeared...
What the hell are you doing here?
What are you doing in New York...?
It's locked.
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
... You saw her?
She told me.
She did?
I just saw her.
Hi.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
How old is he?
Who told you that?
Mrs...
Mrs. Simmonds.
Kathy Price...
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
Yes.
One hour.
I did.
A single hour.
Well, well, well.  Huh?
It's a long road that has no turning.
Dr. Towler...
Yes, that's correct.
Yes.
...of the procedures...
As I've said we had some more...
What happened in those three...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
What happened in those three minutes...?
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Yes.
How'm I doing so far?
Ah? That complicates the problem.
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
How long have you been back?
Almost a year.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
From whom?
I want you.
That's Carlotta Valdes.
There are things you didn't tell me.
And when she goes to those places...
What happened?
Hello?
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
Do you live here in the hotel?
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
Just let me talk to you.
You.
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
What do you want to know?
Your name. And --
Judy Barton.
Who you are --
-- and how you happen to be living here.
It's a place to live, that's all.
But you haven't lived here long.
I told you! Right here!
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
No, you don't owe me anything.
Then will you for me?
Dinner... and what else?
Just dinner.
Because I remind you of her?
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
An hour?
Mmm.
Thank you again. Good-night.
Can I see you tomorrow?
Tomorrow night? Well --
I'll take care of you.
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
No.
No.
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
But Scottie, you don't have to!
But I like that one, Scottie.
Scottie, what are you doing?
They're none of them right.
I don't like it!
The color of your hair...
Where shall we go for dinner?
Wherever you'd like...
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
Come here.
That's what I had in mind.
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
Scottie!
How does it work?
Can't you see?
We're going awfully far.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
Where are you going?
But why? Why here?
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
No! Let me go!
We're going up the tower.
You can't. You're afraid!
I don't know... Switzerland?
I made it.
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
Love me... keep me safe...
Why am I here? What happened?
You don't remember.
Where were you?
Where had you been before?
When?
This afternoon.
Oh... wandering about.
Please drink your coffee.
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
Wandering about.
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
One shouldn't live alone.
Some people prefer it.
What?
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
-- talking to you...
Would you like some coffee?
I hope we will, too.
What?
Meet again, sometime.
Good-bye.
I don't know.
Shopping?
No.
Well... anywhere in particular?
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
I don't like them.
Why?
Do you hear anything?
Only silence. It's always like this.
And no birds sing.
No birds live here.
Would you like a drink of water?
Where are you now?
Where?
The tall trees...
Have you been here before?
Yes...
Where were you born?
Long ago...
Why did you jump?
No, I can't tell you!
Take me away from here?
Home?
Vaguely...
Would you know the room?
No... it's in shadow.
What else?
A grave...
How do you know?
There's a name on the gravestone.
I'm here, I've got you...
Don't leave me... stay with me...
No, don't go away!
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
Yes?! But --
Here with you.
My love... because I love you.
No... we're together...
You can't.
Why?
Let me go.
Madeleine --
Is there something I can do for you?
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
What is her name?
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
How long has she had the room?
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
Her car is gone.
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
More than you think.
How do you know? Personal experience?
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
I had to quit, Midge.
It wasn't your fault.
I know. Everybody tells me.
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
How's your love life, Midge?
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
What.
Step number two.
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Yeah.
Pop Leibel.
Do you know him well?
The poor thing....
Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
Here you are.
You haven't told me everything.
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
Is she pretty?
Carlotta?
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Midge!
Just wander.
Around.
Mm. Better.
Did you need it?
Yeah.
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
Oh... this and that.
What have you been doing?
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
What is it, a still life?
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
She'll be out in a moment.
Yes! That's it!
The stripper's here.
She's fucking hot!
Jesus.
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
How ya doing?
What did you say?
I said how's it going?
I didn't hear you.
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
You're an asshole Adam.
Multiple reasons.
Name one.
The floor was wet. She slipped!
Why was the floor wet?
Why?
This is pathetic.
You're not a team player.
I have plenty of friends.
The hell you do.
About anybody but yourself. You never have.
And you're a little fucking reject.
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
Go home!
Don't even start.
She's got no fucking pulse.
Wait!
What?
What are you doing?
What are you talking about?
Are you sure this was an accident?
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
There's more.
Just giving the facts.
Bury her out in the desert.
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
Her fucking head was caved in.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
Sun rises at 5:52.
Wait. Wait a minute.
What?
We can't do this.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
That is absolutely not true.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
We have to get going.
I am not flexible on this.
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
What does that mean?
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
Don't talk to me about character.
Fuck you Boyd!
What is your problem?
What?
At the seven-eleven.
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
They won't figure it out.
Don't snap at them!
They're driving me nuts!
What?
They're screaming for Starbursts.
Where's the candy?
We'll be ready Adam.
That's one idea.
Are you solid with that?
Don't ever stare him down.
I won't do it.
I know and I'm honored...
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
No way.
Have you thought about what I said?
I got you.
My god.
Well, oh...
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
So. When is the wedding.
What are you talking about?
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
What is it?
She's not here.
Okay. Hi.
So who's the lucky guy?
Doing the bachelor party thing?
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
She's still working?
That's right.
Is everything okay?
No I don't.
I don't think so Boyd.
But not tonight.
I got her arm.
The past is the past. Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
What's your fucking point?
What's goosed?
He just had two.
You said that Boyd.
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
Oh, Jesus...call the police.
No.
She's dead. Call somebody!
Call 911.
Nobody knows she's here.
What kind of words?
I'm talking about prayer.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
He's cracked up.
He is not cracking up.
Boyd...What have we done?
What did you ask me?
What is the question you asked me?
Say it again.
What you just said. Say it again.
I just want to get married.
Just do it.
What are you going to do?
Take care of business.
That's right.
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
Okay fine.
Fine? Fine what?
Whatever you say Kojak.
You're a fucking moron.
The hell I did!
Nope.
Your ideas never work out.
I don't hate women.
You hate women.
False.
True.
Not true.
And what happens when you can't?
Israel doesn't have a King.
Then what do they have?
There's my point exactly.
What? What's your point?
Take Mexico.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
We're goosed.
We're goosed! Goosed by God!
Stop it!
Stop.
Goosed!
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
What?
This is ridiculous.
Why can't we do it through the mail?
We missed the deadline.
Can't we do it on the phone?
Why is this Kid staring at me?
I think so.
Sent it.
Photographer?
Sent it.
Florist?
Yup.
Caterer?
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
I think I forgot the tent.
You forgot the tent?
I think so.
Why?
Why did you forget the tent check?
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
You can't play around with these tent people.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
What else have you forgot?
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
Don't you dare.
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
Are we going to do this again?
Well it's bad timing.
How do you figure?
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
He is.
He's a moron.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
Who else?
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
I just don't see him in the big picture.
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
He's weird.
He's quiet.
He just doesn't talk a lot.
Why? What's his problem?
He's a great chef.
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
Time out.
That's absurd.
Do you love me?
Of course.
How much?
With all my heart.
We've got problems here.
Seating problems.
Okay.
Keith do not trivialize this.
What kind of seats can we have?
Not padded ones.
So what do we do?
You go down there.
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
Honey I don't have the time...
I need your help.
I need your help.
I'll call them from the road.
Take care of those chairs.
I will.
Do you love me?
I love you.
Hello.
Hi.  Are you calling from jail?
That's sweet.
Well I do.
Well you should.
What are you doing?
Just a bit of organizing.
Nesting?
Yeah. Nesting.
I'm mad at you.
Hello.
Hey. It's me.
No. Just like an hour or so.
What about the chairs?
Okay.
What okay?
What!
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
Well, can you come back inside?
Yeah. Sure.
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
Are they fighting?
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
No way.
We're not canceling.
I know.
Yeah. You.
No.
Don't even.
Do you love me?
What?
Do you love me?
What kind of stupid question is that?
Who's dead?
The prostitute.
You fucked a prostitute?
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
You killed a prostitute.
Micheal, by accident.
Call the police.
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
He kept saying he was protected.
The only proof is those bodies.
Move the bodies.
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
Just kills me...
Everything okay?
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
What does that mean?
It means she's insecure.
I don't care for him.
He's your brother.
I'll take a ride.
Go for it.
I'm getting married...
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
Where did you get that?
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
I don't hear it.
No...No.
The first day.
Did she believe you?
A move?
Greenpeace.
Where's Boyd?
Did he try to kiss you?
There.
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
What song?
The stone age.
A mutant species.
We will.
Good times.
She's dead.
Right.
Shut up Micheal.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
Where's the camera?
Are there many windows?
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
Don Amalio!
What's that?
Enedina and Paco ...
Which couch?
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
Was that difficult to get?
You have no feelings toward ...
How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
What do you mean?
Don't you ever see him?
And this innocent child.
You must think I am a monster.
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
Leave us alone, Ramona.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
You must listen to me before you go.
Leave me now. You can go to bed.
You believe me, don't you?
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
What will the lady say?
Is it all right?
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
How much is that?
Fifteen yards.
That's fifteen by seven?
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
And in the vegetable plot?
It's very good.
Thank you; but it's missing something.
My God, what have you done to him!
He was asking for it.
Ramona! Ramona!
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
Nothing.
Why the bad temper?
If you wake first, wake me up.
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
What are you thinking about?
How in hell does it wind up?
Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
Why?
I don't know -- they've always been there.
Miss Viridiana ...
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
What do you know about me?
What are you doing here? Get out.
Do they worry you that much, then?
Are they going to work here too?
And ...your friend?
She's left.
Is she coming back?
No.
Then let him go and he'll follow you.
What's he called?
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
You'll soon find out, you liar!
Stop this!
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
You cannot leave ...
Where?
Why are you crying?
I'm afraid.
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
A black bull came.
It's a very big one.
Very, very?
Yes -- very, very big!
He came in through the cupboard.
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
What's going on, Moncho?
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
I had so many things to think about!
Forgive me if I have offended you.
When you are, miss.
She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.
What about you, Manuel?
She looks like a sick marrow!
Welcome, miss. I'm Ramona, Don Jaime's servant.
How do you feel?
I have a headache.
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
What?
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
Why would they be going there?
I don't know.
You all right?
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
He was a computer program for crissake.
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
What about them?
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
On my life, I promise you I will.
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
Think you can do it?
This better not be a wild goose chase.
How does he know who I am?
He hears...everything.
I haven't been working on anything.
Get that fucking thing away from me!
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
How do you kill it?
You need a maid.
What's wrong with Parker?
How should I know?
I wonder how that...
He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
Should I have?
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
It was you, wasn't it?
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
I am beautiful, aren't I?
Help me get out of here.
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
I don't need a babysitter.
He was reenacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
She's beautiful, you know?
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
Don't get out of the car.
Enjoying yourself?
You know I am.
This isn't a game, Parker!
What's the problem?
Which way?
You're not capable of it.
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
Nice work.
Can I ask you something?
You don't know?
You okay?
...I think so...You?
More or less.
Lindenmeyer?
My guess is dead.
Sid?
How's your pulse?
I couldn't tell you.
Then shoot him already.
What do we do now?
There you go  best seat in the house.
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
What if he's busy tonight?
<u>Lure</u> him. 
...on the way in.
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
It's the White House.
What about it?
It's <u>producing</u>.
Ames here.  <u>Yessir</u>... 
...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of... 
What can it hurt.
Okay.  Here's what we're gonna do.
And...she's not an Illegal Immigrant?  Is she?  Can I see her "chart?"  Because...
A small, "calico" kitten, sir.  "Calico." 
...can we have a white one...?
...this is a snappy song....
Hey, hey, I'm just the Producer, I'm just the <u>Stationmaster</u>, Johnny Green wrote that song, and...
Mr. President, this is St...
Izzat the thing...
...The Albanian Campaign...
Yeeaahhh...  Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...
And?  NO.  I don't wanna know.  What do you <u>mean</u> "and..."?
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
<u>IT DESTROYED THE ELECTORAL PROCESS</u>.
Come on.
...where?
...how do we Explain That?  Hey?  Am I worried...?
What rig?
What are you talking about?
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
Who we got here...?
We are virtually certain it isn't...
Who's got the story? 
It won't hold.
All I need is the one day.
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
Car and a driver, Mr. Brean, the Westgate, Now, please...
<u>Do</u> it...
What would do that...?
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
Gimme twenty thousand dollars.
Tell, tell, tell me again.
....we landing?
We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
Who would find out?
...the... 
The American "people"?
Yes
Who's gonna tell'em.
...you want us to go to War...
...that's the general idea.
...they sound what?
<u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
Yes.
...<u>nothing</u>...
...where is the Back End coming from?
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
Waal, that's where you <u>want</u> em...
Why is this putz on the air...
...take a long view.
Yes.  That's true.  But...
We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.

Maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
Yeah...what was I talking about...?
Due in Nashville.
We're gonna do the <u>Team Song</u>.
...this is magnificent.
...fourteen years...
What are we going to do?
War's over, Pal. 
Ronnie says we don't need'em for another four days.  ...s'there a problem?
How's your wife?
That's not bad at all.
Uh...Didn't we <u>do</u> this?
... you want Schumann saved by an Illegal Alien...?
Stanley, you can't do this....
Oh, MiGod.
"...where's my pill..."
CAIN LOOKS DOWN AT HER SCRIPT.  SHRUGS, AND LOOKS UP.
Where is he?
Well, c'n we get him back home?
Captain...  You wanna Take'er up...?
Course there's a war.  I'm watching it on Television.
N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?
My name is Ronald Brean.
S'only got to hold for another few days.
What's on your mind?
I have a question for you.
Ask it.
Why do people go to war?
Why do people go to war?
I'll play your silly game.
Why do they go to War?
To preserve their Way of Life.
It can be documented that he displayed the...
...why?
...you the Press Office?
What's more interesting than boffing the girlscout?
But there isn't a B-2 bomber.
When's he coming back...?
Do I know you?
What do you think would hold it off?
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
Why Albania?
Who?
I never won an Oscar.
Well, no, well, you couldn't <u>tell</u> any...
...that's what it is.
"The Country Is At War." 
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
They got to have something that we want.
I'm sure they do.
"Freedom."
...who is this guy...?
Act Two:  and then, Act Two...
And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?
...it's a Teaser!
No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?
Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
The War ain't over. 
What're you gonna do with Morse Code?
I think it's fine?
In the Folk Music Section.
...this the Guy.
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
Where is he now?
Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...
...we get our hands on him?
They got him standing by.
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Not bad for government work.  Having a good time.
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
Well, yes, but the guy <u>did</u> bring Peace.
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
Getting off on the inaugural?  Gonna go...
Medal.  Medal and Ribbon.
Of what?
The Albanian Campaign.
...the Albanian Campaign.  And we won't even be a footnote...
They should be.  Most valuable animal since Sea Biscuit.  <u>Isn't</u> he...

He's fine, as long as he gets his medication.
Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt....
Mmm.
Wake up.
Get on your feet, boy.
Uh huh...why?
You can't tell this story.

No, I'm On Top of it...
"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
...one more day.
No.  You're right.
Show Must Go On.

I'm looking for a phone...
Don't tune it too good.
Hold it a minute, Benny, willya?
Let's take the bridge from <u>nine</u>, and the intro from <u>one</u>, and...
Keep Talking....
All part of the Service we Render.
He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
See y'at the Finish Line.
Black...
Well, <u>that</u> ain't very butch, is it?
...I meant the Leopard Skin...
British Regiments drape their drums in Leopard Skins.
I have the White House on the Line.
Isn't Johnny Green in the... 
We-are-mobilizing-to-defend-<u>her</u>.
Can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>?
I didn't ask for a dog.
Yes.
It's tough to rhyme.
I believe in you....
Albania, Albania, Albania, James bond Villains.
John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi...
Jim Belushi...?
They guard our, <u>you</u> know ... "borders," night and day...
...they have the capacity to Meld into the <u>Woods</u>, and...
I'm just talking about the Hats.
The hats.
A beret.
Cause you can crush it and put it in your pocket.
With their berets...
I need a ruling on the Hats.  I say a Leopard-skin, and...
No, no, no.... we'll punch <u>in</u> a kitten.  Um... <u>Later</u>.
Yes. 
A wider option of what?
Long's you git me back for the beans...
...where's my l'il <u>pill</u>?

Yup.
Oh, hell...
Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
Of course, we're gonna need some <u>water</u>, uh...
Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?
Sounds like a french word, what is it?
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
Buddy boy, how ya doing?
...well, see him?
Got a little action there, eh buddy?
What the hell...
Hey the door was open.
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
The stock's going to Pluto!
Start unloading.
Sell?
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
...Got a 100 on me, you...
You sure about this FAA announcement?
About what?
Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
Your words, not mine...
Another cup of coffee?
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
I guess it's time to hit the road.
What if he asks where I got the money?
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
What if they call him?
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
Rising profits...strong balance sheets, good earnings per share.
Nah, she asked the wrong question.
So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
So what firm you with, pal?
See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...
Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
Sorry, Mr. Gekko.
I guess I'll head back...
Why do you need to wreck this company?
...I can't make it tonight.
Hello Bud.
Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
So. See you Friday.
You really do believe in destiny?
Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?
Well, why stop at that?
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
Hi.
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
Any better and I'd be guilty.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
It's over you, Gordon.
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.
Are you prepared to put that in writing?
With Mark?
Businessman?
Yeah, yeah, OK
Well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big.
Anybody want another drink?
We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Would you like a closer look?
Yes, I guess you're right
Your books Master Loftmore
Thank you Jenkins
Thank you
Thank you
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Jenkins!
Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
No Jonathan.
She went to a waxwork party
A party at a waxwork huh?
Velcome to ve Vaxverk.
I hope you enjoyed your visit.
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
They seemed, closing by much 
Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
What?  Tony and China, together?
That's not what you said last night.
Sarah listen to me.
Safety in numbers man.
No thank you sir we're fine.
Well?
Well divide 18 into three
Can this be stopped?
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
Stop saying things so loud!
Do you have a scarf?
Yes?
It's only two hours away.
I know that.
Of course you will.
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
He loves you very much.  He just--
I miss you.
What do you mean?
I started seeing things.
Did you?
No.  But once I heard...
Who's idea was it?
I didn't want to come.
Then why did you?
Because he was worried about me.
Do you really think so?
Fireball?
These are good.
What does she look like?
Pretty.  She's a blond.
Do you have any idea who she is?
Try to communicate with her somehow.
Are you humoring me?
What's happening to me?
Your friend saw them.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
No.
How're you holding up?
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
At the party.
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
Who's that?
Yes?
Well maybe your wife...
She isn't here.
When...when will she be back?
Oh-kay...
Give me that shit.  Your wife.
You're the flower lady.
Um...yes.
I've seen you.  From the window.
Hello?
What?  What are you afraid of?
That's not...It's not like that.
I wanted to apologize.
And then you weren't there.
Would you like some iced tea?
Love.
You must think I'm pathetic.
Mrs. Frank?
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
You know where she is?
No, I don't.
What's your name?
Claire.
You look a little old for a student.
Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.
They're calling me in to work.
Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
What was her major?
Wow.
He looked like one of the Monkees.
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
I didn't sleep with him.
...just so she could cut them off.
He was so pissed.
I came in from my room...
How you holding up?
Good.  I'm good.
Okay, I'm a little tender.
What is it?
Kambucha mushroom tea...
You're discussing me with your psychic?
Thanks, but I'm fine.
Yep.
Know what I think?
What?
Seance.
Jody, no...
Telling you...
...no...no...no...
Someone's there.
In the window.  Norman's at work.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
The planchette?
Nothing's happening.
Oh...
Mef?  What's Mef?
I have to go.
Are you okay?
Does Norman know?
Jody, she's alive.
Something was there.  You saw it.
But Claire--
Oh God...you knew.
I was down in Adamant...
What are you going to do?
If she was dangerous before--
Jody, she tried to kill him.
I know.
I can't believe this is happening.
Did he say that?
I think three...
She's awake.
When's she out of here?
It's today?
Claire?
Whatcha reading?
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
If you have to work...
Fine.
It's okay if you're not.
Not the focus.
It's just us now.
Nope.
Wanna fool around?
Did you...
Maybe we should just...
After that.
Of what?
Of him I think.
Did she say that?
Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.
That's not what I'm sug--
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
But what if something happens?
I know.
Mmnph.
Unless you need me to come home...
Claire?
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
In the house.  I was scared.
What kind of whispering?
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
I think so.  Maybe.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
That's...
"...for my father."
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
Did you tell her?
What?  No.  No.
Sorry.  You understand.
Get down!  He'll see.
He killed her.
Our house.
It's a flare.
See?
What am I looking at?
I didn't do that.
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
When you do this, I swear...
...Don't get all...
There we go.
I don't need a shrink.
Harvey says he's amazing.
Are you lonely?
What are you doing out here?
This is the Feur thing?
How do you know this?
We had a seance.
Keep your voice down.
I'm sorry...
Do I have everything?
Yep.
What?
I felt you...looking through me...
We walked all night...
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
But I don't remember.
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
The...
Stop...
...I'm positive this time...
...Please stop...
It's Madison Fra--
I take it your not mad at me.
What's the matter?
It's too rough.
I don't like this, this...
Who?
Your wife...
"You know..."
I was there.
It was last year.  We were having troubles.
So you fucked a student?!
That's not what I'm sayi--
Who?
I tried to break it off!
Claire...
She did it.
We don't know that for sure.
She's gone.
She can't be here without me.
Look for antiques...
Adamant.
Huh.
Do you know it?
Don't think so.
What's that for?
Nothing.
I'm cooking you dinner.
You don't have to do that.
I know.
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
Mmmuh...
Shhhh.
What?
:Would you stop it!
I have seen him again.  Last night.
There are two.
With his hands!
How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
Don't tell Rowan about this.
What have the witches always asked of you...?
Nothing was ever more false.
Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.
I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
Hello...?  Who is this...?
Who is this...?
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
I beg your par---
When did she die...?
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
I had you sent away.
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
What is it...?
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
You kept her in this filth in restraints...?.
She didn't feel them
Go back, MICHAEL... Go Back
The door, Michael.  find the key...
Michael...  Do what you can.
Lasher - bring us through!
Parents say he - uh - fell -
FAST.
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
STOP!
YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
Explain this to me --- violated...?
Made it...?
It is from love.
To love, you must be able to feel.
There is no one here but the dead.
Go away!  I don't want you here.
If that were true, I would not be here.
A girl...?
What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
I LOVE him!
Do not tell me that!
I love Michael...
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
What is wrong...?
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
Put - him - down!  His - his heart...
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
Harder...
Rowan...
Harder...
Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
Yessss...
I'm glad you're around to say it.
What do you see...?
Just one.  The bar's closed.
The one time I want it to work...
Harder...
Rowan...
HARDER!
Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
Why don't you let at do that...?
Doctor's orders- - -?
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
Seems more like a year than a month.
We're quite a pair, you and I.
Hello...?
Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!
Do you love me, Michael...?
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Maybe he's just - waiting...
Ro, how long have we known each other.
You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?
Wanna snack...?
You look a little green.
Nobody makes a car like them Nasis...
That's cause we're below sea level.
You did that, didn't you...?
Is he - is he gonna die...?
If it's a boy --- Taylor.
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
When aid you get home last night...?
Hi.    You - you wanna get some breakfast...?  Maybe see a movie...?
I can't.
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
Lasher...  Where --- where is ---
You can't just -
'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?
Wow...
I'm getting --- left behind.
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
Rowan Mayfair.
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
You really love this guy...?
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
Which do you think is her best shot...
The one on the left - definitely...
That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.
OH MY GAWD!
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
So there is only one key...
That's right...
Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job
All the time?
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
This must be one of the old keys -
It doesn't mention 'females only'
I lost the touch
What are you doing?
My names isn't ANGELA...
So what do you do?
Oh, about six years since I graduated
And how many people have you killed?
I don't know
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
How long have you been watching me?
Tell me how it happened...
Why should I?
STEPHANIE?
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
What's wrong?
What is it?
Where are you going?
We've got nothing to talk about
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
First finish your tea...
Why did you let him in?
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
I loved you ELLEN - why did you do this?
Don't you want me now LESLIE
Well, what do you think?
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
I want you out now
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
It's been what, three years?
What's this all about?
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
Just put it in my room
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...
Her husband left her
Dr STECKLER?
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...
Sugar?
Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...
I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
Who the hell was your father?
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
So far away? In Xenia?
Hurry.
What is it now?
Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty?
Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
Oh, how inappropriate is that!
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
You'll never believe who's in there.
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
You got everything you ever wanted.
Naked girls, wild sex, video games. No wonder it's called "Heaven."
Never say never.
What gives, Don Corleone?
We reinvented ourselves.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
From your lips, to God's ears.
You go first.
Ladies first.  I insist.
Well. The prom's coming up.
Yeah?
And I was wondering.
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
Hi, Teddy Bear.
Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
Do it?
Which you pulled, hard!
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
You have changed since second grade.
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
We miss you. We miss our son.
You guys are my parents.
Son.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
It's okay. You need me?
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
I-I don't have the keys.
You do know how to drive?
The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.
It's your car. These are all your cars.
I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
Who exactly ARE you?
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
Teddy? I was thinking.
Ted! Do something!
What do you want me to do?
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
You're on the next plane home.
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.
My new bike.
If you could just sign right there.
You want it in writing?
He was my Grandfather, too.
I meant biologically.
That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
I have absolutely no intention--
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.
Your article sucked.
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
Then I'll write about YOU.
I guess.
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
Why can't you be nice to me?
Where are we going?
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
He phoned it in.
Your dad taught you everything.
It's all so complicated.
Eventually you'll let go.
You're amazing.
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
That's probably my office.
Well? Where the hell are you?
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
That's refreshingly deviant.
What about you?
I'm very aural.
You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
Do you trust me, Julie?
Not a chance.
I want you to trust me.
That's hard to believe.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
You're quick. I like that.
Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.
Very ambitious. I like that.
Yellow pages?
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
That's part of growing up, honey.
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
Only the best for my mother.
You promise you'll finish school?
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
But who would run the store?
I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
I never figured you for a pimp.
Rules are rules.
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
You called the cops on us?
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
You do like girls, don't you?
Of course I like girls.
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
I told you you could do it.
I was like a different person tonight.
You were the new and improved you.
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
Really? You'd do that for me?
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
My father must've been amazing.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
What are you doing?
That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
Bad news.
People pay good money for that?
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
Talk to me Artie.
How you doing, Artie?
You look pretty.
And where might that be?
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
Merritt, Forensics.
Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too...
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
Maybe she used another name.
I don't know what to say...
I've got that two o'clock in town.
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
You saw the news today?
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
Guess I kind of lost it there.
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
If you want company...
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
Will you do me one favor?
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
That bothers you?
About a year ago.
He dropped Jimmy off first?
No.
So you were alone.
Did he come in with you?
At that point were you able to fight him off?
He did say something.
I want a full-scale investigation.
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
Ms. Toller?
This wasn't my idea.
What?
It's those rocks, up there.
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
Oh, for Christ's sake.
What are you looking at?
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
Is there some reason why you're here?
Get off my property.
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Hi, Mon.
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
Okay, what's the matter?
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.
I would hardly say you look like trash.
Kelly.  What is it?
I miss Dad.
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
He... Sam Lombardo?
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
Where, the mall?
Don't forget the car wash.
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
So, where you off to now?
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
Do it to ourselves?
Kelly.  Is Suzie there?
I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...
Hello?
Hello.
And you believe her?
That's not your line.
Say you love me.
I love you.  Now give me the line.
I'm running away.
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
I just want my life back...
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
No.
It doesn't look like it.
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you?
I had to go look for this coupon.
Yes.
And she wanted to talk.
But she ran away.
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
Sam...
What's wrong?
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
No.
Shit. Here we go again.
Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?
Jim West.
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
But don't pull that again.
Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
You need that real often?
That should put us ahead of the criminals.
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
Prepare what?
Almost?
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
What was all that back there?
All what?
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
At least I tried something.
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
You might have mentioned you had that.
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
They're so precious when they're asleep.
Know what this is?
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
This is good.
Oh, damn!  That's it.
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
Willard...
It's not a guy...
Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
Not again.
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
Oh, thank you.
What?  President Grant is...!
There's only seventy-eight.
It was in your book.
Are those just button buttons or...?
My God!  He's so excessive!
What is this?  A whole new train?
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
You didn't tell us you had this on!
He calls it the Tarantula.
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
A new friend?
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
Would that include me?
You've... done... this... before.
My.  It's gotten longer.
Your private train, sir.
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
French?
Good work.  Really.
This is Colonel Richards.
And?
No, sir... just a businessman.
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
He had a pressing engagement.
I've even printed my own currency.
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
Dr. Pemberton?
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
This is something.
Now it's a bomb.
Well?
They're coming.
When are they coming?
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
You're not going to use it, are you?
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
You're chasing a dream.
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
Thank you, friend.
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
Sir!  I have to talk to you.
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
You!  Are you the mother of that child?
I can't.
I can't.
Why not?
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
I do what I'm told.
You're a fool.  Now put her back.
Why did you say that?
Say what?
Because it's true.
Sorsha.
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
He's no magician.
Then you get us out of here.
Who is that girl, anyway?
We're a tiny version of all that?
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
Thanks for your help, Peck.
You a woodcutter?
You all right?
Smells like a battle.
Are you a warrior?
You hear trouble.
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
You gotta promise to feed her.
I will.
Fresh goat's milk.
Hey!  Give me that baby!
Time to change her diaper.
Because she's sick.
Where's the baby??
Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
I'll help you...!
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
Did she ask about me?
She asked about you, Madmartigan.
She's in love.
Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places.
Want me to carry Elora?
Can't we keep it, Dada?
Who are you!  Who are you!
Kill him!
No!
You must learn magic.
That's all I ever wanted!
I'm all finished.  Now what?
How am I gonna do that?
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
Ouch!!
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
His will.
I just wanted to test it first.
Tir Asleen.
Why?
No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
Time is running out.
Patience, Willow.
I'm not going in there.
Get back here, Rool!
She needs to be changed.
Madmartigan.
Who is he?
Who??
This is not going well.
Talk!  Say something!
Maybe milking.
Milking?
Cows. You know, cows?
I've seen pictures.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Where's Timmy and Buck?
Who are these orphans, anyway?
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
John, why?...
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
Your hole is healed, then?
Nail it!
Everything is all right, John.
I saw him.
He was... like him.
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
Hey, Sam...
...I want to say a thing.
What are you going to do?
Don't let them hurt you.
Have you got your gun on now?
How reliable is this kid?
Amish.
Yeah.
Maybe.
You know who?
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
Who else knows?
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
Who else knows?
You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out.
It's all over, Paul.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
They kid a lot.
But not a good tired.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
Home.
No, no doctor...
Does anybody know I'm here?
Only the elders.
How long?
How long have I been here?
Tell him his tea stinks.
Something wrong with buttons?
Buttons are Hochmut.
I'm going this morning.
But Stoltzfus said...
The... bullets?
Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
We had some lemonade and he left.
What else can you do?
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
But... You may not be well enough.
When will you be going?
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.
I know.
You're so sure of that?
That's your way, not mine.
Where's my baggy pants?
Anybody know about this?
I didn't even know about it.
You hear me?
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
Say again?
You know where he is.
Wrong.
You'd lie to protect him.
You admit you're lying?
I admit I don't know where he is.
You're the first one he'll contact.
Did you find him?
I don't know where he is.
Everything okay?
Yes, thank you very much.
John said you're Amish.
Yes.
Who was that man?
Is the English dead?
No, Rachel...
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
She say where he is?
Tight. But I'm working on him.
He's not in this building.
You might have killed him!
My son is out there!
Momma... are they angry with us.
I don't want to stay here.
They are English. They don't understand.
I wish dawdie was with us.
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
To see?
If she...
If she?
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
Uhhhh -- yes...
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
Oh --
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
Oh, please give me back my dog!
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
Run, Toto, run!
...Toto, too?
Oh, now?
Are you ready now?
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
Aw, come, come, come --
No, they won't - honestly.
That's our farm!
...her face is careworn.
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
Uh-huh.
...bed.
Oh, no -- no!
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
Now you're seeing reason.
Oil can.....Oil can....
Where do you want to be oiled first?
Oh --
No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
Oh --
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
Oh - I'll get it!
We might.
What sort of an animal is that?
And him a brain.
No.  Why only --  Oh --
Oh! Something bit me, too!
Dorothy!
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
...has been simply unbearable.
A home --
Yes -- let's run!
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
Who's her?  Who's her?
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
How about a hippopotamus?
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Supposin' you met an elephant?
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
I'd sooner wait outside.
But why?  Why?
Because I'm still scared!
Oh -- Oh, come on.
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
Did they hurtcha?
They're coming back!
...Ain't it the truth!  Ain't it the truth!
Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
...don't talk.
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
...yes.
Ohhhh --
Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
Ohhh --
...free!
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
They would?
Um-hmm.
You're going to see a Wizard?
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
To Oz?
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
What?
Oil can what?
He said his mouth.
Here -- here --
The other side....
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
Oh, come on now - everybody -- 
No -- No -- No -- No!
...ting the ruby slippers?
Yeah.
Ah --
Dorothy next!
What if it were a brontosaurus?
Who at?
What happened?
Somebody pulled my tail.
Oh, you did it yourself!
I -- Oh --
Here --   Come on.
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
I've got a plan how to get in there.
Fine.  He's got a plan
And you're going to lead us.
Yeah. Me?
Where -- where do we go now?
You humbug!
I haven't slept in weeks.
Why don't you try counting sheep?
Not even a rhinoceros?
It's a whatzis.
It's a whatzis?
Whozat?
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.
No?  Now, wait a minute.
Where do we go now?
Mr. Gale!
... about Dorothy.
You mean she bit you?
No, her dog!
...Tin Man!
No, sir!
That's right.
We do.
To Oz?
Animals that -- that eat straw?
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
Come on -- come on --
Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!
Hey, Dorothy!
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
Let's.
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
Ha -- ha -- ha --
Oh, did - did you see that?
It's a whozis.
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
Now, now, don't fret.
Oh, dear, dear.
Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right. We must worry about Dorothy.
...to Dorothy!
Oh --
No, you don't.
Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
Oh - upstairs, quickly!
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
It makes you nervous?
What about us?
But I still want one.
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
-- Ruined my exit!
You new?
What happened to Len Tashka?
So who are you?
When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
The plutonium is missing.  Theyve taken the core!
Whos she?
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
Makes her look even more innocent.
Hes sealed himself in.
Do you know what youre doing?
What kind of bikes did you ride?
But what if...
Weve got to get out.
I love Christmas in Turkey.
Perhaps after this ... test?
Constructions not exactly my line.
Ive scheduled a medical for you.
You havent been given an assignment in this case.
That which does not kill me makes me stronger.
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
Your last chance. Take the money.
Your last chance. Give me the name.
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
In case youve forgotten.  Im dead already.
Beautiful, isnt it?
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
He was my father.
How long has he been with you?
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially Kings daughter.
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
Oh my God...were buried alive...
I cant stay here.
No!  It will cave in!
I cant stay.
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think Im a coward.
What is it?
James...
I have to go.
Then take me with you.
No. Youll be safe here.
I dont want to be safe!
Vodka martini.
If this little show is for my benefit, Ill take you home right now.
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
You can drop the act, its over.
Wheres M?
All this, because you fell for Renard?
Was this all about the oil?
Know what happens when a man is strangled?
One... last... screw?
Valentin Zukovsky.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
Shes no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
Whats your business with Elektra King?
Now...where were we?
And the payoff on the tables?
Wheres the sub going?!
Where?
The Maidens Tower.
No! Bond!
Someone will come.
Warm.
He was a...good lover?
Do we have the range of Renards plane?
The parcels in the post.
Its heading for the oil terminal.
Any word from him?
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
What?!
Had a lot of blood in him.
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
Walter --
A whore fucking.
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
God isn't there to do it.
Hi, Jon.
The bearer of bad news.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
Would you like me to stay?
Mm hmm.
I could stay and go.
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
Jon, I do not want to hear it.
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
What -- am I --
Jon, where are we?
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
Adrian -- you've lost it.
And what if you¹re wrong?
I¹m not.
Damn straight.
His what?
His . . . whatever.
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
They're practically on us . . .
What?
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
Those cars.  What year is this??
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
What do you mean, frame-up?
Coward.  Giving up.
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
We should get back --  What?
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
Did you know he was back on the streets?
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
Their real names, please.
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
I'm terribly sorry.
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
Adrian.
Don't rub it in.  I live here.
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
Maybe I'll do that.
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
New information.
Ever see one of these before?
Who the hell are you?
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
What is this place?
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
Is that all?
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
We're not after car thieves here.
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...
The scum of the Earth.
But programmable. And expendable.
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
What do you get if you finish?
Like what?
Yorgi asked me to.
Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you.
Who are you?
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
They tell me you're an American agent.
So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
They left. To a fortress in the mountains.
We'll have to go after them.
Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three.
Where'd the damn truck go?!
Toadies right behind.
You okay?
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
He's shut out the communication circuit!
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
Nothing. He had two days.
What was that for?
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
This is your standard dart gun.
I'm through, Xander.
Nice hops.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
Sorry, "dude".
What's so damn funny?
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
Help me with this guy.
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.
You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
I wish I could go.
Scott.. I -
I don't like him being here.
What's wrong with him?
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
I'll tell you one thing though.
Into the Hudson?
Jean... can you?
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
How long have you been in Alaska?
I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
Anything else I can get you?
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
By reading my thoughts?
If necessary.
You should always work with a spotter.
Were you now?
What do you say?
Let go.
He's uptight.
He takes his work seriously.
Dr. Grey.
The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
What is it you intend to do to me?
Where am I?
Where are we going?
To find Rogue.
You designed this yourself?
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
I felt like she almost killed me.
If she held on any longer she could have.
Is that what you're looking for?
A piece.  Only a piece.
Is it enough?
I'll find him.
I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
Yes, my dear, he is.
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
Frederick Frankenstein?
You have the wrong house.
And who might you be?
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
Where did you get this cauliflower?
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
No, sir.  It will never happen again.
Give him an extra dollar.
Carlson!
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
Baack!
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
MMMmm!
Is it that music?
Still happy you married me?
Love me oodles and oodles?
Hello...?
Surprised?
Well... yes.
Miss me?
Darling!...you will be careful!?
Of course.
You have your tickets?
And your passport?
Yes.
Promise??
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
Will you miss me?
Oh, nice.
I hope you like large weddings.
You're incorrigible!
Does that mean you love me?
I will!  Goodbye, darling!
Goodbye, darling.
Darling!
Surprised!
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
What a strange fellow.
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
Are you suggesting I call him master???
No, of course not.  I just meant...
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
That's a tough choice.
Is it worth taking a chance?
Good night.
You mean... the laboratory??
Yes!... the laboratory.
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
There seem to be quite a few books.
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
Well... we'll see.
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
Dr. Frankenstein?
Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune.
But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
How long will this whole thing take?
What?
Break that old man's violin.
Yes, sir.
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
A piece of what?
How old are you, young man?
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
Frederick Frankenstein?
Fron kon steen!
Are you putting me on?
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
And do you also say Fro dereck?
No, Fred ereck.
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
I see.
No, it's pronounced Aye gor.
But they told me it was Ee gor.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
Are these your bags?
I beg your pardon?
There wolf!  There castle!
Why are you talking like that?
I thought you wanted to.
What wockers?
The wockers with the knockers.
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
Fro-derick!
But what you were doing?
Just putting up some tea.
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
What is this place?
What a filthy job!
Could be worse!
How?
Do you have the name I wrote down?
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
I want that brain.
Hmm!
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
If you like -- just hurry!
What?
More, do you hear me?
Throw the third switch!
Don't try to cheer me up that way.
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
But you did -- I just heard it.
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
You can say that again.
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
... I'm glad that's...
No, no!  That whole thing!
Yes, Master!
How's it going?
What did you find out?
How do you know it was a 'he'?
All right -- where is she?
How do you know it was a 'she'?
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
Can you play it?
Thanks...for all your help.
That sound good, boss.
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
There's only one way.
Come on, big fellow!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?
Hello there.
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
How's everything?
Get the sedative ready!
What's that tune that you're playing
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
Nice!  Nice little balance to it.
Extremely well.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
Inga, wake up!
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Ooh!
Well, this explains the music.
Oh, doctor!
Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.
A god?
Yes!
Right here?
Raise the platform, hurry!
Reputation.  Reputation!
Oh, Doctor!
I think you've done it, master.
It looks that way.
Me?  Sing?
All right -- give it to him!
Are you serious??
Give him the sedative!
Did you do it?
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
Just passing through the night.
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
Nor to Elizabeth.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
Yes, I have mine.
Yes...yes, you have yours.
Why don't we talk inside?
Yes, I know.
It wouldn't be fair to her.
Are you ready for me?
MMMMmmmmm!
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
His what??
His schwanzstucker.
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
Four
Three minutes to go!
What d'ya want to do to kill time?
Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.
Another fifteen seconds to go.
Yes, sir, name, please?
Food!
Do you have a reservation?
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?
