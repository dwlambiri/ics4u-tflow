Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
There.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
You know Chastity?
Have fun tonight?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
The "real you".
Wow
She okay?
They do to!
Did you change your hair?
Who?
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
It's more
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
Where've you been?
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
You are so completely unbalanced.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
What?
In 9th.  For a month
He was, like, a total babe
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
Let go!
Patrick -- is that- a.
But she doesn't want to date.
Daddy, I --
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
Oh, God.  It's starting.
Wear the belly before you go.
Daddy, no!
The prom?  Kat has a date?
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
You the new guy?
So they tell me...
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people go here?
You burn, you pine, you perish?
You know French?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
What about him?
What makes you think he'll do it?
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
Number one.  She hates smokers
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
Assail your ears for one night.
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Cameron, I'm a little busy
What 're you talking about?
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
You makin' any headway?
She kissed me.
What's the worst?
Hey -- do you mind?
Where ya goin?
Away.
Leave my sister alone.
Yeah
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
You need money to take a girl out
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
I just upped my price
What?
A hundred bucks a date.
Forget it.
It's about time.
How'd you do it?
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
Hey.
Are you lost?
Nope - just came by to chat
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
Who's that?
What's this?
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
William would never have gone to a state school.
William didn't even go to high school
That's never been proven
What'd he say?
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Have you seen him?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
Pick you up Friday, then
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
You -- covered in my vomit.
hey.  Great show, huh?
Excuse me?
That's what you want, isn't it?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Okay?
I just need to lie down for awhile
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
Why 're you doing this?
I told you
Sure, I do
Who?
Busy
No, you weren't
Then why'd you ask?
I should do this.
Do what?
Start a band?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
Who?
What are you doing here?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so --
Wholesome.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
So what did I have an effect on ?
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Put your right foot there --
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
A soft side? Who knew?
So what's your excuse?
Acting the way we do.
Then you screwed up
You up for it?
State trooper?
Fallacy.
The duck?
Tell me something true.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
What?
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Is that a request or a command?
You know what I mean
No.
No what?
No, I won't go with you
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
My grandmother's .
Because I like to torture you.
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
My insurance does not cover PMS
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.
Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right
Parts of it.
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
Hi.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
You think?
Macbeth, right?
Right.
Kat a fan, too?
Say it
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
What?!
Ever been to Club Skunk?
So you got cozy with she who stings?
You were right. She's still pissed.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
You're completely demented.
In the microwave.
Tumescent!
Have a great time, honey!
What just happened?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Absolutely not.
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
He's the devil's child...
Your life, and that of others!
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
You can see for yourself.
I could be gone for years.
She said yes.
I don't want you to wait for me.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
Can't you stay with us a little?
May I ask by whom?
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
My letters of appointment.
Appointment to what?
I want to go with you!
There'll be a time.
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
I have to explore the mainland.
How are you feeling, Fernando?
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
No...
You defend yourself admirably...
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
What do you see?
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Say not here!  Cuba!
You come!  You speak first!
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Chief says -- how many?
Thousands.
To bring the word of God.
Chief says -- he has a God.
... and also to bring medicine.
He understands.
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
God... That's in a week!
That's what it says.
How can you be so certain?
Esdras is a Jew.
Passion is something one cannot control!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
All of them!  Just lies!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
I believed in you...
I suppose we're both old men now.
I have to disagree.
I knew you would.
New worlds create new people.
The ocean is uncrossable?
What did they say about Granada before today?
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
How old are you, Senor Colon?
We can't raise the wheel without it.
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
What do you read?
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
Six days ago, yes.
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You think I don't know that?
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
You tell that to them!
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Don't say anything.
Where are we going?
I'm coming with you.
You bring the cigarettes?
...delusions and paranoia.
No, he is here.  Shit...
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
No.  No way.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
I'm abused.  Don't you think?
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
I will if they don't send me back.
Are you married?
So...the station is empty?
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Yes, I considered it.
No.
What about back home?
So you were never a prostitute?
What are you asking me?
Are you alright?
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
Is he your boyfriend?
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
You better get packed.
Do you have coffee?
In the kitchen.
I'll make some for us.
What are you doing?
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
Who did cause and origin?
Who do you think, Chief?!
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
I let her take a shower.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Yeah, right.
I'm gonna propose.
When?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
What's he looking for?
Where is she?
Sorry...PD only.
Only one guys checked in?
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
You know what that is, right?
Watch the news?
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
I don't even watch TV.
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
You're Polish?
My folks are.
You got any better ideas?
Mind if I ride along with you?
Two heads.
You thirsty?
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
Why not?
What would your girlfriend think of that?
I don't have a girlfriend.
My point exactly.
I'm serious here.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
So...who's Nicky?
What's your accomplishment.
I kill someone famous.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
How many victims are up there?
There are two bodies found at this point.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Alright.
Alright.
Hey, honey.
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
You're ruthless.
That's good.
Yeah.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Okay, til tonight.
Tonight.
You promise?
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
Okay.
See you later.  Good luck.
Thank you.
So what's unique?
Keep them out of my way.
Okay.  You ready?
Any chance we can do that again?
You stuff sausage in it.
Are you married?
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
Tell him to put his gun down!
Let her go!  Let her go!!
Hi, I'm Honey.
Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.
How much money are you carrying with you?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Who is he?
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
In here, says he wants a million.
Don't fool around.
Did you hear what I said?
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
You said speak Czech!
How you erase this?
Get in the bathroom!
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Shut up.
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
Why not?
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
I'm serious.
You got that?
Emil???!
We spent it!
I can get you a job.
A job?
Yes, the money is good.
As a plumber?!
Robert...?
What are you doing here?
Viewer discretion advised!
Isn't he a little moody?
Yeah?
I'm trying to tell you.
A cheap hotel.
What are you coming here to do?
No.  Go ahead.
What was that?
I'll take him.
No way!  He's mine!
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
He's my collar!
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
How did you start the fire this time?
I used an accelerant.
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Clean?
He knew all along.
How long they been livin' here?
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
How was it?
Get outta here!
What the hell happened?
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
CONTINUED
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Right. Just a sec.
Okay. 
Sure, what is it?
What's up?
Really.
I suppose the idea was specialized training.
That seems very unlikely.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
But not completely inconceivable?
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Good morning. How's it going?
Are you reasonably awake?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
You're kidding.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
Hal?
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
Well, don't worry about it.
And don't you worry about it.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
The antenna has to be replaced.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
CONTINUED
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
I'm having a party tomorrow.
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Oh, thank you very much.
Thank you.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, very pleasant.
Are you quite sure?
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
That's right.
Fortunately, they did.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
That's true.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
Name?
This is three years old.
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
Yeah.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
Whaddya mean, buy?
Pay money?
I never paid for it in my life.
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
You're in a hurry.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
I hear you've got visitors.
You're gonna help us take him.
You lying son of a bitch...
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
You here to write my life story?
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
Luther was part of the gang?
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
Hey, this works pretty good.
Thank you.
I think you better put him on ice, man.
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
Now, where we goin', convict?
I don't give out the details.
Last night.
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
There.
Must be billy's girl.
How much?
Half a million.
We split 50-50?
Where's the goddamn car?
What?
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
You stay with me...
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
What about Luther?
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
Why?
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
It's late, they're closing...
Do I get to kiss her too?
Hey, there she is...
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
Jack?
What the bell happened?
I lost them, that's what happened.
Which one pulled the trigger?
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Tell me that's not the same guy.
You look awful.
Doesn't look like it.
Bullshit red tape.
What am I wanted for?
Hey, you're right.
I'm all wet.
Hey, you know what I really think?
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
That's the way I see it, too.
Call me later.
You sure you want me to?
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Great place for lunch.
Yeah, one of my favorites.
No wonder you're so popular.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
Jack, wait...
Hello.
Hi, it's me...
Hey, I don't believe it.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
You're impossible...
Hard man to live with.
Hey, two days with him is enough.
Hey...
Stall.
Keep stallin'.
How hot are they?
How ya doin'?
We got a lot to talk about.
Yeah, old times.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
Don't give me this, we were partners.
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
How you doing, man?
You want to go outside?
How about some ammo?
Don't mess with me. How much?
Five bills.
Five.  On credit.
Give it back.
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
Corn-i-Lius?
What're you laughing about?
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
...would you like a drink?
You are a monster, Zorg!
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
Who are you?
I brought the girl remember?
He's a she!
So you do know her.
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
What kind of mission?
We have to save the world.
Good luck..
Leeloo's in trouble?
When is she not in trouble?
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
Is there anything that can stop it?
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
They really made her...
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
Yeah?
I just found a picture of you.
How do I look?
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
Uh... at least fifty.
So, just how big was this fare?
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
When EVIL returns so shall we.
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
Yeah?
Have you pulled yourself together?
Hello?
You little sleaze bag!
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
You have nine points left on your license..
I'm sorry..
6... 5...
You know how to fly this thing?
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
What did you say? What did you do?
Is that all?
What mission?
To save the world.
And the third one?
Don't you open your messages?
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
I'm not going.
...Shit!
It's my wife.
Three of us will never fit in there!
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
You hear that?
Cornelius..
Finished what?
Learning language.
Which one?
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
Apipoussan!
Uh...
You know women normally change five times more than men.
You noticed..
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
I'm so very sad.
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
The wind blows... the fire burns...
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
...Like love...
Tell me...
The cash man!
Thanks..
This is all that survived?
Actually only one cell survived..
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
This thing solid?
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
They just landed in the desert.
Is that better?
Options.
Wait or act.
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
Drink!
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Am I disturbing you?
Got it.
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
I'm not accusing you...
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
I love you.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
... What's going on?
What happened to you?
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
You couldn't?
I don't know what to say
You're killing me...
Who are you calling?
Mrs. Christian.
Anything harder?
There's nothing harder.
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
Bullshit.
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
Dino...
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
A fellow investor.
You said something about money.
That's five thousand dollars.
And they are?
I want to watch you work.
I'd rather you didn't.
What's the problem?
Where's that?
You brought the money?
Excellent.
Where are the women?
What are you... ?
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
Call me Tom.
I figured you share information.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
Celebrity Films.
Eddie.
Yeah, who's this?
I know what you did.
What?
I know what you did.
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
I'm gonna kill you.
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
Don't ask questions.
Starting to recognize a pattern?
What do you want?
Who is Machine?
I don't know...
How much did he pay you?
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
Why?
Stop talking.
You got absolute zero.
Show me where you buried her.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
Do it.
Easy enough for you.
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
You are a private investigator?
They're no friends of mine.
You're asking me why?
You almost went over your limit.
Give me the film.
Big date tonight?
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
How long you been working there?
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
How much do you make now?
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
How old are you?
Twenty-five.
Where are your parents?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
Specialty product.
You're learning.
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
It's their Presidential Suite.
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
He's odd.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
I told you I can't, not yet.
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
You've found missing persons before.
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
Hello... ?
You told me to look, so I looked.
Hello?
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
No.
Why do you think he did it?
We're all like that.
Are you religious?
No.
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
Do you think the police did a good job?
How... how can you say that to me...?
What is this?
Those are her belongings.
None too discreet, is he?
Okay, I'll take it all.
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Alice, you think you can leave?
You alright?
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
I can't go back to sleep again.
I'm sure they're around.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
We have matching luggage.
You've been up all night?
That obvious, huh?
No...
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
How long have you been awake?
Not really.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
Here we are.
What the hell was that?
You look great!
Rick, please.
It was Freddy.
I don't get it.
What's wrong with me?
Something wrong with the stairs?
Avoid-all-contact-day.
What is it?
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
Feeling better now?
You just stay put.  You need rest.
You don't get it, he's after me...
Excuse us, dear.
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
Hey...wake up.
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
It's lonely in there, in my room.
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
Who says I don't like you?
Hi, beautiful.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
You're right.
There you go.  Love you.
Where are we going?
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
How was the meeting?
Sobering...
Very funny.
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Since my little girl became a mom...
Alice!
But Dad --
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
You think that's the place she's buried?
You do good work, Alice.
I've got to write some of this down.
Mark, are you okay?
I thought about that.
Then get out!
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
Who's Jacob?
My baby!
They think I'm nuts.
Poor woman...
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
These things are wild...  What do you think?
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
Vomit?
It's okay.
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
What is it?
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
Unidentified Flying Objects.
But if they <u>do</u>?
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
We're stuck tight!
Yeah?
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
You hear that?
Somewhere down there?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Well?
Is there any way out of it?
Seems to be all around...
What about down?
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
Excuse me, Skipper---
Now they feel it...down below.
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
As we near the Pole...
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
You're sure it's Cyclops?
What's the running time?
Right <u>at</u> him?
That's what I said!
But - what can we accomplish?
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
He did!
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
Twombley involved?
What are you boys up to?
I plan to. Soon.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
You heard the news.
I hear Twombley got shot.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
He's on to us!
You can't buy Wade off.
We bought you.
If you get it?
Yeah.
You might not kill it.
I used to play ball.
Yeah?
Drafted by the Red Sox.
You played for the Sox?
Really.
They said.
Safety on?
Yeah.
This way.
Sun's gettin high.
Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
No brag. Just fact.
Like you and Gordon?
Where'd Twombley get shot?
In the chest.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
You stayed away?
Yeah.
Where'd you get the blood?
What blood?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Sure you did.
What?
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
I'm fucking out of here.
Those are the Hoyts.
Why do they do that?
Do what?
You know.
Break stuff?
Yeah. It's stupid.
Was it funny?
To us it was.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
What are you talking about?
It's not that.
What then?
It's stupid.
No.
I called Mommy.
Yes.
Are we going in this?
It belongs to Pop.
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
No.
What do you want, then?
Okay.
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
I want to go home.
That's illegal, you know.
I know.
You're a policeman.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
I want to go home.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
You don't want the extra police pay?
Huh?
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
How you holding up, Wade?
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
Want to buy?
Maybe.
You and Mel Gordon?
Lillian!
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
We should talk.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
See. Get your boots.
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
Did you get his number?
I know who it is.
Good. Who?
Mel Gordon.
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
How's she doing?
See you tomorrow, maybe.
You okay?
You okay?
I'm sorry about what I said.
Forget it.
You don't mean that.
Call me.
Tonight. Let's get together.
Money.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
Alright. I'll think about it.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
Strange.
Think they're alright?
Of course! I would've heard.
This is nuts.
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
There's a furnace.
Coffee's perked.
When did she die?
It makes me sad.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
It don't look right.
Jack?
The other guy.
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
His office. You mean my old office.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
Just do it.
Nothing.
Sleeping.
You remember Margie Fogg?
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
Love! I'm made of love!
Call it what you want.
Yeah.
Bang!
Rolfe.
Twombley.
No shit.
You think Jack shot him?
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
Huh?
The night before the shooting.
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
Which is?
That it wasn't an accident.
Then who shot him?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
I'm sure he's busy.
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
Some kids were teasing you?
Mom?
Daddy. Daddy, please...
I don't drink coffee.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
Oooooh, I'm good.
How was...  ...the ballet?
Alice!
Daddy...
There they are!
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
Put your pilot on.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
Got it.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
They aren't answering their hails.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
Why?
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
That's affirmative.
Dead.
How many others killed?
Nine.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
why did they do that?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Stand by.
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
A dubious distinction, no?
*                     Please tell me your name.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
You're pointing a gun at me.
What do you know of my husband?
I know he left you behind.
Yes
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
No.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
Four...
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
I'll not going without my family.
Sir, we stay with the President.
Can't it wait?
You know what?
I miss you. And I miss her.
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
I don't know why you stayed.
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
What are you doing?
The fax machines.
Excuse me?
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
Someone should give you a raise.
We're under attack.
Where's my family?
One.
But...
who can I say is calling?
This is the President.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
Thank you for calling the white House...
You wanna knock of f?
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.
You give me ulcers.
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
Shepherd.
My god. I think that was a MiG.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
IT'S OPEN!
WE'RE HOOKED!
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
Forget it.  I was reading.
I was reading too.
Kruger, Sagittarius.
Did you feel that?
Yes I did...
Oveur.
Shut down accelerators.
Dunn.
Sir?
Elaine.
It's got to be stopped!
Ted, what's wrong?
Ted, we're taking off!
Ted.
Not now, Elaine!
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
What word would you use, Elaine?
Elaine!
Ted!
Elaine, what's going on?
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
You mean...
That's right -- premature ejection.
Are you afraid?
Set!
Now!
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
I'm so excited, Simon.
I guess this is a first for you.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
Have you got it straightened out now?
I think so.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
You can do it from up here, Captain.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Negative.
Go ahead.
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
Scraps.
Can I hold him?
Sure.
He's a boy dog.
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
All right.  Here.
You're sure?
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
No.  Poached.  Over.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
Sixteen 'C', why?
Captain Oveur?
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
I have to see Bud Kruger.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
All right, it's a matter of death.
You can't go in there!
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
Do you want to talk about it.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Ah, won't you sit down?
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Surely there must be something you can do.
Captain, how soon can we land?
Can't you take a guess?
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
What did he have?
Just how serious is it, doctor?
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
Ted, what are you doing here?
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
I love you, Elaine.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
Rain.
And a little ice.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
Rats! I've lost number three.
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
See them, Elaine?
We have a visitor.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Did you decide on a runway yet?
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
Oh, I can't stand it.
How ya doing, honey?
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
Hi!
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
Oh, I'd love to.
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Roger.
Roger.
We have clearance, Clarence.
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
Excuse me, Sister?
Do you feel all right, sir?
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
You okay?
You are Cassandra?
William Harcourt?
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
Kill them both.
Here?
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Get the picture?
And that fits?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
Why did you do it?
Who said that?
Uh, Matthew...
Back off, George.
But I-- .
Screw you.
Tell me.
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
Which one is that?  Raw what?
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
Who is he?
Yeah... I know the routine.
You are married?
Your health...
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
Well, let's roll, George.
To the... to the beach?
Stop the car.
Please, I must get out here.
What was that about?
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
We?  You've taken it?
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.

Shit!
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
No!  We must do this alone.
What is this?!
... It's Harcourt.
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
But there's no more drug.
How do I look?
You think this is the guy who did it?
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
Ss'kya'ta'.
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
Departmental policy.
Hope their plumbing's the same.
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
Get outta there!
I can't!  Do you mind!
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
Movement!
Position?
Talk to me, Hudson.
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
I'll go.
HOW MUCH TIME?
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
You did okay, Bishop.
Have they located my daughter yet?
No.  There's no way!
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
You son of a bitch.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
Still nothing from the colony?
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
What is it?
I don't know.
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
I told them to fall back...
Sir?
Yes, Hicks?
Sir, the CPU is on-line.
Save it.
Let's get the fuck out of here!
The corner!  Ready?
Seventeen meters.
Well you're not reading it right!
Let's go!  Let's go!
They're in the approach corridor.
They'll get us.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Locked.
Hicks, don't let him leave.
Ellen.
Fuck you.
It's inside the complex.
Looks like it stung him.
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
Thanks.
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
Range twenty meters.
Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.
Nine meters.  Eight.
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
And how are we today?
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
Casey.  She's my only friend.
You promise?
Cross my heart.
I guess we're not leaving, right?
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
No, it's different, honey.
Did you ever have a baby?
Where is she?
Gone.
Newt.  Newt, wake up.
Wah...?  Where are...?
Burke!  Open the door!
Mommy...Mommy?
Are we going to sleep now?
That's right.
Can we dream?
How many colonists?
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
His Grace is very angry with you.
No.
Where?
What's that?
A brothel.
Oh!
What does he look like?
You might be disappointed.
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
What?
How was I? Tell me honestly.
You were sublime.
Extremely clever.
Don't bother!
What?
Don't bother.
No, she's fine.
Is she a good fuck?
What is it?
I want to go!
Now?
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
That's stupid.
Why? People fart backwards.
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
Em iram! Em iram!
No, I'm not playing this game.
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
What?
Tish-I'm-tee.
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
Yes!
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
What's the matter with you?
Tell them to go!
No!
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
There's a young girl to see you.
What does she want?
I don't know.
Wolfi.
Yes, my love?
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
What?
You're not going to do this?
Who was that?
No one.
I'm not telling you.
Why not?
No. Don't answer it!
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
Give me one reason I can understand.
I can't write it!
He's terribly busy, sir.
Then he didn't send you?
Originals?
These are originals?
Come back tonight.
Tonight?
Alone.
Some service deserves service in return. No?
What do you mean?
He asked me to stay.
This is not his handwriting.
Am I interrupting something?
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
Money! Money!
I see that you're expecting.
Oh, yes.
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
Be careful!
He's adorable!
Behold!
Hey!
Behold!
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
Upstairs.
Gertrude!
I said play!
What a strange young man.
Really?
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
Just one year.
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
What a charming idea. May I see?
It's just a trifle, of course.
May I try it?
A-flat, Majesty.
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
Sire.
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
What? On one hearing only?
Yes, indeed.
And German?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Would you tell me why?
Yes, sir.
Well, what do you have for me today?
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Yes, what about him?
Why are you here?
Is she not here?
How is your financial situation?
It couldn't be better.
They say you're in debt.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
Pupils?
Yes.
Yes.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
What's that?
Oh, let's not talk about it.
Why not?
It's a secret.
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
No, really!
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
Papa, is this your idea?
No one calls you that.
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
Yes, thank you, sir.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Do any pupils come to the house?
Really? What is it he's writing?
Where does he work?
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
What medicine?
Yes?
Are you Herr Mozart?
Sssh!
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
Well?
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
Leave that alone!
Wolfi!
Put it down!
Yes.
Can I see it?
No.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Really?
Mio caro Adone.
Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
Did you like it, then?
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
Of course not.
Do you have a daughter?
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
What exactly are you working on?
With all my heart, Mozart.
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
How could I not?
How could it not, Excellency?
What work?
A Mass for the dead.
What happened? Is it over?
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
You mean she's not coming back?
Do you mean that?
Shall I answer it?
No! No, it's him!
Who?
The man. He's here.
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
Would you? Actually, you could.
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
Consigned to flames of woe.
Do you believe in it?
Oh, yes.
Strange!
We ended in F Major?
Yes.
The Fire.
What time?
I think so.
It couldn't be simpler.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
With the tenors.
I think so.
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
And that's it. Do you have it?
You go fast!
Do you have it?
Do you want to rest a bit?
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
I'm not leaving you.
I am so ashamed.
You mean in Turkey?
That will do, Herr Mozart!
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
What are you doing, Herr Director?
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
Because His Majesty wishes it.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
No, but I'm the best.
Who is on this committee?
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
What do you want?
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
Where?
Here in Vienna.
Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
All Vienna has heard that.
And do they believe it?
Is it true?
Do you believe it?
Do you hear me?
You cannot say that!
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
I did.
No, you didn't!
I poisoned his life.
But not his body.
You mean that play?
Yes.
Are you absolutely sure?
I've seen the manuscript.
Where?
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
What anger?
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Bravo, Your Majesty!
Here I am, my angel.
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
I can't wait.
Well, promise then.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
Herr Salieri.
Yes, I am looking after him.
Can we come in?
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
Bene.
The American? Yes, duck.
How did he look?
Dr. Hirsch?
Go about your duties.
Oh, Miss Price?
What exactly did he call out?
Did he say a wolf?
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
It's a full moon. Where is he?
Yes.
What did he say?
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
No, why?
Is David acting strangely?
Could you get here without any trouble?
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
He's fine. We'll come right over.
Shall I send a car?
No, a cab will be faster.
What shall we do?
It wasn't a lunatic.
I beg your pardon?
It was a wolf.
What?
Mr. Kessler?
Yes?
You haven't eaten your lunch.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
Aw come on, Miss Price!
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
You're a very beautiful girl.
I thought you were asleep.
I was. What are you reading?
What do you dream about?
I dream of death mostly.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
How old are you?
That's not really a very proper question.
How old are you?
Twenty-eight.
I'm twenty-seven.
Now what do you want to talk about?
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
My best friend. My very best friend.
Hello. You all right?
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
Will you come with me?
Not just a patient -- me.
I'm a werewolf.
Are you better now?
I'll let you know the next full moon.
My friend Jack was just here.
I was dreaming again?
I would think so.
The kitchen.
Closet.
Charming.
Bathroom.
Lovely.
The bedroom.
It's nice to see you.
Alex?
Of course.
But, David.
Tomorrow is the full moon.
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
Do me an enormous favor?
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
I've left those pills for you.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
The next corner we can get a cab.
I should be committed.
But...
David, what are you doing?
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
David, don't lose control.
No.
No what?
Feeling better?
No.
How are we feeling tonight?
No.
No what?
No.
Chart says he's from New York.
I think he's a Jew.
Miss Price.
Officer, I killed those people last night.
All right, you two, move along.
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
Oh, come on, tell us.
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
Where am I?
You're in a hospital in London.
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
There were witnesses?
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
Are you cold?
Yes.
Jack.
Well, I like it here.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
Okay.
Hello.
Nice looking group.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
What about it?
It's a five-pointed star.
Ask them what the candles are for.
Right.
Go on, ask them.
Jack, we'd better go.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
Beware the moon?
What do you think was wrong?
I have no idea.
Did you hear that?
I heard that.
Yeah?
A coyote.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Heathcliffe.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
No, but he was on the moors.
Shit! David, what is that?
I don't know. Come on.
It's moving.
What's the plan?
Plan?
It's in front of us.
Nice doggie. Good boy.
See anything?
It sounds far away.
Jack?
Yeah.
Where are we going?
You really scared me, you shithead.
Nice to see you.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
I'm going completely crazy.
David!
We were attacked by a werewolf.
It's you, David.
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
You're not real.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to see you.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
Yes.
Jack, are you really dead?
Hi, Jack.
What can I say, Jack?
You don't have to say anything.
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
You look awful.
Because this must be stopped.
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
What here?
Hello, there. What can I get you?
Sorry, love.
No.
Remember the Alamo?
No, thank you.
And what, Sergeant?
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
Yes - sure
Where's Matt?
He has?
How much?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Charlie!
Mr. Dickson in yet?
And tell him not to delay.
We want to talk to you.
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
Oh!
You understand?
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
I'm sorry, Dude, butI
That don't do us any good.
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Well
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
Why are you so anxious?
Don't you know?
What's this?
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
Why, Matt!
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
Now?
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
John, how's your wife this morning?
Much better this morning, thank you.
Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
I'm feeling fine this morning.
Shall we let the people come in?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
Happy now?
Why - well, I
Where is he now?
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Good morning, Helen.
Yes?
Mr. Sampson . . .
Helen!
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Got my letter?
Yes, thank you.
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
I haven't any.
You haven't got a uniform?
Oh, make that uniform blue.
Looks good. How much did it cost?
I already told him I was home.
No. I won't.
You're protecting somebody.
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
My wife? What's she got to do with you?
Well, Sampson, what is it?
The lobby's half filled now.
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
Is it safe?
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
He's at a board meeting.
Hello, Helen!
Matt, come here!
Why?
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
What did you do with it?
With what?
The ten dollars.
Oh, ten dollars
No.
Oh, you think I'm lying?
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
What's keeping you?
Oh now, don't be silly.
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
They must have turned him down.
Did you say Dude Finlay?
Yes, why?
He was in the bank yesterday.
He was here?
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
Are you sure?
Dude Finlay?
for the rheumatism, you know.
What time was it?
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
It couldn't have been earlier?
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
Then who changed it?
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
How are you fixed?
I'm okay, Matt.
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
Everybody in?
I guess so.
You can ride like that?
I think I may just go on to the reservation.
I couldn't lose him.
This is healing?
Sometimes a wound will kill.
He's smiling.
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
Uhh, yeah it does.
We got a problem here, brother?
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
How'd they --
I ain't done --
Bob. I didn't...
Swear.
I swear --
He's not bad at it.
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
Corn gonna shoot at me?
Nope.
The Army can hang him.
You have no shame.
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...
You are a fine figure of a man.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
He's planning a job.
What you sayin' boy?
I think I recognize you.
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
Ride with me, cousin?
Where you boys going?
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
Hands off your hip, Cole.
Not now.
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
She had a moustache.
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
Perfect, Cole.
The James-Younger Gang.
Sorry.
I got seven thousand.
It'll be the biggest score yet.
I got us through the War all right.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.
Dammit!
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
Bob, rip up some bandages.
We'll make them pay for this.
Missed you, cousin.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
Well?
Cannon or Gatling?
I think one of 'em's glass.
Which one, right or left?
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
Shakespeare.  He's European.
Another dozen out back.
They gonna rush us?
The safe. Now.
Of course!  Uh, sir?
What?
Where is Jesse James?
You 'um big lawman?
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
You're right, sir.
Then why can't I go in there?
On account of we're robbing it.
It's a secret.
Fine. I'll just wait here.
What the --
Where the hell were you?
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
Web died fighting?
What do you say, sir?
They're gone. What are you --
Distracting enough for you?
Mm-hmm.
That would have made an impression.
I reckoned.
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
Frank, don't you have something to say?
That just might work.
"Big and older"?
You can shut up now.
You are a charmer.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
She's still talking to Jesus.
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
How'd it go in there?
Fine. How'd it go out here?
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
Bob's upset.
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
This has been a good year.
Jesse, we're outlaws.
You've killed your fair share of men.
We're doing this for Ma.
We're drunk.
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
That he was.
They're making him a hero now.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
Can't argue that.
Uncle Frank?
How much of that story is true?
Did you kill Yankees?
A fair number, Ma.
Ma! Please!
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Doc Mimms will --
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
You were little Jesse James when you left.
Jesse, are you awake?
Jesse, is that your hand?
You're sick of my company?
No! I mean, of course not. No.
I shouldn't tease a hero.
A river pirate.
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Not if I find the right girl.
Sparkling rocks?
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Me neither.
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
Hmm.
Stop it. This is just sad.
Don't turn around.
Tennessee?
We're moving you tomorrow.
Last February?
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
I figured.
That's what I would have done.
I'm not hanged yet.
You cocky little bastard.
Now let's have a drink.
Right here in church?
Well, not exactly.
... too young for whisky...
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Not at all.
I just though you were awful cute.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
There's only four of them...
Yes sir.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
THEN WHO DID?!
The final route for the railroad is complete.
Parker.
Sir?
What is that?
This is him.
How did you know?
This is no game.
So you can't tell me anything?
Can't you tell me anything?
So he's won.
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
Stop it. I'm...
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
Pumpkin?
Yes?
I know. Stop it.
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Courtney? Dinner?
I can't.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Dorsia's nice.
Okay. Yeah. What time?
Eight?
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Are we here?
Yes.
This is Dorsia?
Luis is a despicable twit.
Is it a what?
Pull out.
I'm ignoring you.
Pull out, goddamnit!
It's a plain end. I think.
Take it off.
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
What are you doing tonight?
That's nice.
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
Patrick?
Yes?
I haven't seen you around here.
You just haven't been looking.
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
Nothing like last time, promise.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
This is nicer than your other apartment.
Do...what.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Yes, darling?
Is your Evian spiked?
We should do it.
Why don t you just go for Price?
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
He's rich.
Everybody's rich.
He's good-looking.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
He has a great body
Are you using minoxidil?
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
But what about the past? Our past?
We never really shared one.
Where are you going?
I'm just leaving.
But where?
Because he dated her.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
Are you my two o'clock?
Can I help you?
Doesn't he live here?
No, he doesn't.
Are you sure?
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Don't come back.
What exactly do you mean?
It's just not.
No, you...didn't?
Uh huh.
It looks so soft.
Patrick? Is that you?
Call me please, Patrick.
What...is...it?
Where are you going?
Patrick?
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
SHUT UP!
What's that, a gram?
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Leaving what?
Don't, I'll drink it.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
We are totally booked.
Oh really? That's great.
I said we are totally booked.
Late?
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
When?
After six.
Oh? And what should I say?
Just...say...no.
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Patrick?
Patrick?
Jean?
That is...if you're not doing anything.
Oh no. I have no plans.
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
Jean? Sorbet?
Want a bite?
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
No, not really.
Who's Ted Bundy?
Forget it.
Sorry. 
Patrick Bateman's office.
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Patrick? Is that you?
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Where are you?
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
Patrick? I can't hear you.
What are I doing?
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
...to the office this afternoon.
Why?
Just...say...no!
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
So, what do you do?
What do you think I do?
A model? An actor?
No. Flattering, but no.
That's...that's too bad.
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
Next Saturday?
Uh huh?
You're at Paul Owen s.
Who?
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Coffee?
No. I'm okay.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Oh no, I'm okay.
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
Understandable.  Lime?
Shoot.
How old are you?
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Where did you go to school?
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Nice. Very nice.
Who do you ask?
Bad habit.
No, I guess it's okay.
You sure?
Yeah...Yale thing.
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Do you feel that way?
No. Not really.
Where did Paul hang out?
Hang...out?
He had a yacht?
No, he just hung out there.
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
We were both seven in 1969.
So was I.
Well, maybe he did, huh?
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
Actually, yes.
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
No.
Nothing.
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
So...you hang out here a lot?
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" 
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
That's not the information I've received.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Let's see...  That you were with-
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
No hash browns?
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
And?
I've questioned him.
But Marcus denied it?
He does? You're sure?
I checked it out. It's clean.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
Where was Marcus?
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
I'm so hungry.
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
What am I gonna do?
Listen, what's your name?
Al.
Speak up. Come on.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
It's...it's...all right.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
Oh well, you know.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
Hey, Halberstam?
No, Owen.
Is that a raincoat?
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
You are a fanatic.
"Make" him?
You don't wanna move, do you?
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
...But?
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
That took some fun out of --
He's your boss. He's not your --
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
What!
What're you -- what?
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
You think I don't know that?
I can't just walk away!
...Whaddo I do?
Nothing.
...Why?
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
That was -- different.
Look at this.
Milo?
Don't we have any chopsticks?
Here we go.
...wanna savor this.
It's gonna get cold.
He'll tell me when he gets home.
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
And Outpost? You're happy there?
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
You're interfaced with our dish.
Is it your software?
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
Milo? I'm Danny.
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
He's pretty tight with his family.
Would you like a Coke or something?
You know a lot about art, I guess.
'Think I should buy some originals?
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
How's it going?
You did this -- overnight?
Well -- you sent for me.
You really wrote this just today?
What're you implying.
It scales, don't you think?
I heard what happened.
Did you?
Talk about work? Never!
Oh. Yeah.
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
Gary, hi.
You look a little tired.
I'm okay. It's going well!
'Have a look?
That's great! Thanks.
You could've handwritten it.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
This is good. Who did it?
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
Hasn't affected his work, though.
Gary, don't worry, we --
Okay, #2.
Ready for number three?
Let's go.
Longitude 109 --
Wait... He knows.
Gary?
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
I think you should go.
You do?
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
We'll come up with the next big thing.
...You wanna work -- here?
Every entry was authorized.
Keep looking.
What're we looking for?
You calling Phil and Randy?
Come with me.
Lisa.
You know my name.
You know mine.
You're famous around here.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
Did you wanna be alone?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
That's great. I -- didn't know.
I snuck into #21.
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
They'd frame him.
...Milo?
How close are you?
You mean -- break in?
Why were you snooping in my office?
I told Teddy about you.
What'd he say?
The dishes are juiced up, too.
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
That's lame, isn't it?
Meet me at the other location.
It's three years old, it --
Bring it to the other location.
Maybe it's the satellite.
...He knows.
Is that how Larry feels?
I met this girl.
What? Come on. Is it serious?
I don't know.
So -- how far are we from the campus?
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
Maybe he'll get back to work.
Speaking of which...
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
That kid's the great white hope.
I could get it out of him.
Who're these guys?
Where is he?
You seem surprised to see me.
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Come in.
May I wash you?
In Japan, men come first and women come second.
Or sometimes not at all.
Care for some saki?
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
To my health.
Is it about my teeth?
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
Hey, how are you?
Good luck, Austin.
Thank you.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Be careful.
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
When do I begin?
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Thank you, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Be careful.
Yes?
Right away, Exposition.
Thank you, Basil.
Oh, and Austin...
Oh, yes. Thank you.
Yes?
Be careful.
What's the other?
Carnies.
My God, Austin, what have you done?
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
Yes, Basil?
Be careful.
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
Yes Basil?
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Good on ya, man.
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
That does not compute.
Why not? It's a question.
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
Excuse me?
My wedding tackle.
I'm sorry?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
Do I make you horny?
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
A limousine has just pulled up.
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
How do you know?
Let's go get him!
He's too well-protected right now.
I don't get it.
I hate having my picture taken.
Fancy a nibble?
I'm sorry.
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
You're smashed, Vanessa.
I am not.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
No, did you use a condom?
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
Who?
Does that make you horny?
Shut up.
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
Are you crazy?
I have something to tell you.
Lay it on me.
I love you, Austin.
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
Everything seems to be in order.
Here, have a piece of gum.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Commander, I have to log it...
We've got a lot of work to do.
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
My son?
Quite impressive.
Sea bass.
Right.
They're mutated sea bass.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
Blow me.
What did you say?
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
Great.
How's Austin?
He's asleep.
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
Well, it's kind of weird.
And how do you feel about that?
We don't label people here, Scott.
No, he's really evil.
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
... bottle ...
Red ...
... death ...
Love...
Flower ...
Nature ...
... preserve...
Secret ...
Hope...
... love ...
Fear ...
... love ...
Would that I could say the Same.
You
Have we met?
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
Promised? Who promised?
May I help you, madam ...
Mr. John Steed, please.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
You are female?
As you see.
Then you can't come in.
I have an appointment.
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
People, too.
Hmmm ...
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
What are you trying to do to me?
The Institute ... the funding ...
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
An unholy trinity ...
Of course. I planned that, too.
'Our revels now are ended.'
You know, I believe she's actually jealous.
What are my choices?
Choices?
I was about to throw in the towel.
I had a spot of bother at the door.
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
I didn't. Mother did.
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
My father always wanted a boy.
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
Do you?
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
As per mother's instructions.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
No thanks.
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
What on earth?
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
But
Not quite. This is my field.
But if someone miniaturized the process...
That's what we were working on.
Three agents killed by bad weather...
Is that what you think?
This must be the last straw.
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
Orders.
To kill me?
I could save you the trouble.
Because you always obey orders ...
Mmm ... what are you doing?
But you did suspect me.
Not for a moment.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
I thought you played by the rules.
I'm playing to win.
No, after you.
You don't trust me?
No idea who. No idea why ...
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
What's that you're wearing?
It's called Black Leather.
What is it?
You first.
Trubshaw again? What now?
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
I'll be back ...
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
Mrs. Peel?
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Have you any place in mind?
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
Our chaperon.
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
Peter's brother?  But --
Who's now vanished.
I was getting to it.
Privately owned by ...
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
I shall need a small plane.
Oh, hello ...
We want Mrs. Peel.
Steed
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
Amnesia?
Possibly. Split personality ...
Guilty until proven innocent?
Where?
Are you alright, young man?
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
You with Mother or Father?
Wonderland Weather Ltd.
No, please! I beg you ...
Walk over to the window ...
Let it be rain, please let it be --
The last one you'll ever see.
You're better than I expected.
I was at Harrow ...
One shot -- for emergencies.
That's not playing by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
If you say so.
You said ... one shot.
Aren't you forgetting about something?
You are, and it's behind you.
What's happening?
Debbie's marrying Rick.
Does Cole know about this?
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
That's what we're going to find out...
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
What?
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Hey, you guys, what's going on?
Man, you're losing your audience.
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
And...
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Five thousand dollars.
Seventy-five hundred.
Rick, I want to talk to you.
I don't want any trouble.
Oh, come on, just a little.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Great car.
The best.
I love that car.
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Hello?
Yes I did.
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
Nice shot.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
Cole, we've got to talk.
I'm going now, Cole.
God, you're a slob.
But a fabulous cook.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
Are you going to have women at your party?
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
I can't sleep.
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
What's the matter?
That feels so great.
Good...
This is it, lady. Last stop.
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
C'mon, I knew it was you.
I don't believe you.
Let's get naked.
Are you okay?
Ilene, Rick promised...
Ilene, are you crazy?
A strange wang right in my palm.
A real turd.
Great bathing suit.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
What are you talking about, asshole?
Your whores never showed up.
That's it, prick lips.
Give him the works.
Gary, you're quite an animal.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Hookers beat you up?
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
What can I be doing for you?
You're a pimp?
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
That's it.
You want to share it?
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
You okay?
Yeah, I guess so.
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
Oops!
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
Rick!
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
Ed... you're kinky!
The phone made me do it!
No, Brett, I...
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
Mrs.?
Where the hell is he?
What's the matter?
Olivier's in that, right?
I'm not really hungry.
What the hell is that?
My gift to you.
Under the table!
I think you'll enjoy this table.
Rick, I'm concerned.
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
Oooooo.
Who was that?
I don't know.
What's this?
How 'bout this?
Now, don't get into any trouble.
Hey, you guys...
Reach out and snort someone.
Who?
Debbie.
My Debbie?
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
Oh these moments do try me...
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
You know Knowlton pretty well?
Biggest in two battalions.
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
Is he...
You gotta let me finish --
It doesn't go like that.
I like what you've done with the place.
What, you've never seen one before?
In the Field Museum once.
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
Sheep don't count.
Yeah? What about Laura --
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
Ya love it, probie?
I'm in heaven, Lt.
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
Thanks.
Hey.
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
This?
Roll the hose.
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
Thanks for the insight.
Brian, look --
Hey, what are you doing here?
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
I saw it.
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
-- What were they doing there?
I'll handle it.
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
Brian.
Jennifer.
You're back.
You look great.
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
Yeah? What have you been up to?
I work for city hall.
With grenadine, right?
When I was twenty.
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
Hey.
I could use a date.
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
You think that's really any of your business?
Well, you did invite me here.
Thanks for the invite.
Got anything to drink in there?
Then why did you quit?
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
Hi.
I don't know anything about it.
You could check. It'd be in his files.
What is --
I'm sorry.
That's a dumb thing to say.
I quit two days ago, Brian.
I'll see ya around, huh?
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
I don't have a story.
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
Where are you going?
-- Shhh.
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
Read.
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
Did you pull me out?
Yeah.
Did I say thanks?
No.
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
Four months.
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
No need to be modest, Brian.
Mr. McCaffrey...
Completely out of control.
Aren't you even curious?
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
Management were pin heads.
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Firehouse.
I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
I'm busy.
He just wants to --
We gotta roll, Stevie...
I'll be there.
They're waitin' man.
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
Stephen, what are you doing here?
Fixing my roof.
He's got piano lessons.
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
The great communicator.
Sorry I hit Jackson.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
He treats you okay?
Okay.
You want some coffee?
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
Putty? On both doors?
Anyway, down here, take a look...
How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
Didn't think you'd make it.
Who's this?
He works for me.
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
You don't know him.
Knock it off. Now.
Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
-- Burn them.
And old ladies?
-- Burn them.
And the world -- the whole world.
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
What do you listen to, Stephen?
It knows us. This one knows us.
Alderman Swayzak.
Inspector.
Don't you have any leads at all?
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
Who?
You took the chalice.
Are you all right, honey?
So what are you doing here?
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
Me?
All right. What are you gonna do?
I want 15 on the Mets.
Are you sure?
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
What money?
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
How's the case going?
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
Keep trying.
He gots to be did.
You truly are a dancing fool.
Everybody say Ho!
Let's go niggers!
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
Well you did.
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
Delacroix.
What do I do?
What do you do?
You might be right.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
What's wrong with him?
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
What are you talkin' about?
Meaning?
You're in this up till ya neck.
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
Good morning, Cheeba.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
No offense.
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
Nice to meet you.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
That ain't funny.
What do I have to do?
Some tap dancing, some singing.
To what?
Mantan?
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
How you sound?
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
The name of the show?
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
Yep, you guessed it.
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
We think so.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
What do you want?
Go away, unless you got my money.
Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
Good woman.  I trained her right.
Purely for medicinal purposes.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
Enough about me, what's happening with you?
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
Where do you go from here?
I love you too, Daddy.
How long has my father been like this?
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
Manray!
How did you know?
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
Do you know how you will use him?
Sounds risky to me.
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
Hello.
This is the group I was telling you about.
Which one is your brother?
We both lied to him.
What do you want me to say?
Same here.
Who's side are you on?
So you have your small victory, now what?
A gift.
Thanks.
Why'd you do that?
I don't want to hear it.
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
He's just playing big brother.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
Don't make me have to use this.
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
Can I kiss you too?
Naw.  I'll take the zero.
You feel good, not nervous?
I feel fine.
So they can be on TV.
You sound like the media.
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
Mantan, we got a show to tape.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
Peerless, your father called.
He said that?
Yes he did.
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
No.
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
Where are you from?
Finland.
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
Let Myrna finish.
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
So what's up with you and DeLa?
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
...the big apple, New York, New York.
To come back to our roots.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
The one with da big...
She hates dem.
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
I heard ya lady is wild.
...no, she didn't...
...yes she did.
...I heard different, thought that was...
...too early...
...too late, maybe around...
...like macaroni and cheese...
...like grits and butter...
I fell out of my bed last night.
You slept too near where you got in?
I slept too near where I fell out.
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
How be dat?
I don't know who I am.
I feel a song a comin' on.
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
A lot?
So what's up with you?
What do you want to know?
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
Oh you do, huh?
Just a little something' somethin'.
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
You don't read, do you?
Never read a book in my whole life.
Maybe you need to start.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
Why don't you call him?
You're sure this is a good idea.
Y'know what?
What?
And?
And what?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Just ask me what you want to know.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Say what, Manray?
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
Don't try to change to the subject.
Why don't you answer?
I know I won't be your puppet.
You can go now.
Where are you bound for?
There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
What is your uncle's name?
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
I have acted as I think fit.
Has he sent the challenge yet?
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
Have you taken my message to him?
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
Is Miss Dugan well?
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?
Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
Good gracious!  What is this?
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
Your honor must lower his voice.
All Europe shall hear of this!
I have no luggage.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
Who else can give me information about you?
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
I believe they will deport you.
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
That is a trifle strong.
No.
Have you had one?
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
Have you not a man whom you value?
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
You want my heart?
It is my only object.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
I feel the ribbon.
Why are you shaking?
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
As much as possible.
As much as possible?
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
All the same, you must name an amount.
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
Then this must be done tomorrow.
May I be quite frank with you?
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
Good night, papa.
Good night, my little darling.
Papa?
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
Is he all right, papa?
Charming Schuvaloff.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
And he doesn't care about me?
He loves me, as I love you.
Can I at least have a drink?
It's ten thirty in the morning.
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
Bill Styles...
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
What do we do?
I don't want to go --
He is the only one unaccounted for.
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
We got -- I don't know, we got separated
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
West was one thing, but this --
Yeah, right...
Why not?
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
I just don't like it.
There's no need...
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
Some.
That son of a bitch.
That'd be my reaction too --
I didn't shoot West --
I apologize --
You saw West's body.
And he'd been shot.
You saved Kendall's life --
We're not finished yet --
He -- He made me do it --
Do what?
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
Where?
Back up.
Cadet, what's your name!
Sir, yes, sir!
What the fuck is going on?
Jesus, what happened?
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
So you killed him?
Whose blood is that, Jay?
Roberto, what the fuck?
Right?
You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.
You hated West more than any of us.
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
If not you, then who?
That's exactly what he says about you.
Bullshit.
Look in my pack.
Why?
You're lying --
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
Full clip to the body --
I... I don't know...
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
What happened to "degrees"?
I didn't kill him --
But you didn't.
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
How do you know?
I don't know --
Where are they!
Maybe --
MAYBE WHAT --
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
You mean not enough to save you.
Tom, where are you going --
Home, I'm done.
That's horseshit and you know it.
They're taking your command, aren't they?
You're a good soldier, Bill.
Stay where you are.
Ah, Christ
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
He's in interrogation?
Yes.
Move him.
Excuse me?
Is Dunbar cute?
Good cop/bad cop?
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
You're right. We should sit in silence.
I plan to grow on you.
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
I didn't shoot West...
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
That bugs you too?
Little bit.
We're fucked, I know --
They got their stories straight.
Are you sure?
I pushed him too hard.
You couldn't have known --
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
You wanted to break him.
Yeah.
Think it'll work?
For what?
No.
Four --
Hardy, what are you doing --
No bodies, no West...
We need to talk --
What are you doing out here?
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Think it'll work?
Nah.
The faggot speaks.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
Pike and I got separated --
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
I was freezing from the hurricane --
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
No one else heard it?
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
Wait --
Dunbar's telling the truth.
Who, Levi --
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?
Thank God...
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
So?
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
He's not Army, it's not official --
You think he did it?
What do you think?
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
Who is she? Where does she live?
Thank you.
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
Bloom like a flower?
You were expecting me?
I have to leave. Tonight.
You won't find a better place!
Fine, I will.
You get the eye?
I brought it.
Bloom!
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
How long have you known my father?
Thirty years. Maybe more.
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
Did you see that woman?
What did she look like?
Well, she... uh...
How old are you?
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
Promise me you'll come back.
You must be Edward Bloom.
Helping people makes me happy.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
It's okay, just leave it.
Lord, I'm sorry I...
Please. Go. Just go.
I'll...
Lucky girl.
Hi. How are you feeling?
I was dreaming.
Spooning the sherbet.
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
There was one time when I was eleven...
I like your stories.
What's your name, Giant?
Okay.
You're not trying to run away?
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
You --  -- are in for a surprise.
You think I'm up for it?
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
So how does it happen?
What did he say?
You owe me three-fifty.
Really.
When did you ever work in an office?
I will.
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
Dad?
Son?
Dad!
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?
How what happens?
Like this.
Where are we headed?
You say...
Daffodils?
They're your favorite flower.
How can I convince you to stop?
Wait! I need those!
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
So what are you up to now?
This is it? The whole vault.
Oh. Oh.
Hello.
I'm going to get started on dishes.
I'm going to check on him.
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
Do you like it, being pregnant?
You need to go.
I'm going with you.
You don't have to.
You never told me how your parents met.
Mmm.
Do you love your father?
You're not.
How did you get here?
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
How much time does he have left?
Would you say you understand Josephine?
Was she one of your teachers?
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
Is he awake?
You first.
What for?
You know what for.
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
It's enough isn't it?
Do you want to stop?
Yes.
What's this?
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
That's not a burn.
Do you like it?
Say thank you.
What? What are you doing?
You can see why it's sensitive?
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
What did he say?
Oh.  We are Russian.
Yes. I know.
Good. 
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
So how long will you be in England?
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
You must have a visa or something...
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
Uh. Do you like England?
What was that?
Oh nothing.
Tell me.
No. It is too judgmental.
No. It's not that.
Do you believe in love?
How is bank?
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
I understand. I'm so sorry
Put the fucking kettle down.
He wants a lot of money.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
He wants the money from your bank.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
I'm so sorry.
Is that everything?
Yes.
Yes.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
Today is bath day.
I don't understand.
Syevodnya?
Syevodnya
"Frenzy".
They go. John. They go.
They go.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
No I don't.
I know you just want to punish me --
I do. I want to very badly.
So you're just going to be vindictive
In every sense. If at all possible.
Where's the restroom?
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
Have you got your passport?
Give me some money.
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
Fine.
He will come back.
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
Why not?
Shut up. I'm not listening.
And? What are you saying?
And. It's wrong.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
Sometimes.
Sometimes which?
Sometimes neither.
Some... What does that mean?
What?
I got what I paid for.
You don't understand me.
Excuse me?
Get out
You are throwing me out.
You don't have to say anything
What? I... I wasn't saying...
Please, there's no... Oh.
I don't have nothing.
No.
Have you had any before?
No.
Are you scared?
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
She's alive!! She is not dead?
I'm trying to quit.
I've got news for you. It's not working.
I don't want anyone to die.
Except for Small Eyes.
I don't know.
What was her name?
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
No. I think I better just go.
Okay. Thank you.
Yeah. No thanks.
Please. Why not?
Okay. Goodbye.
Something else.
You can probably buy them on the flight.
Whatever.
I'm sorry.
It's not mine.
It's not mine either.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
No. What? No. I know.
It's more like a date.
What does it mean?
My name's Sophia.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
You have excellent English.
What are you doing?
Then start taking them seriously.
Lazarus?
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
Angela?
Yes?
I need to uh...
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
Is your niece older than 12?
This gonna get you in trouble?
This was very sweet of you.
I bet you have loyal customers.
You gonna sing me somethin'?
What do you need?
More cough syrup?
Hi.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
That young lady's size, right'cher.
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
Still need a lift?
Holy shit.
You gonna steal my truck?
Thought you had a skirt earlier.
The fuck you laughin' at?
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
Better?
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.
I deserve better than this.
Better'n me?
Better than what you give.
Rose... please...
LAZ, I said let...!
You better pray, gal. You better pray...
YOU SHUT UP!
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
You sayin' you'll do what?
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
Teh... Tehronne?
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
How long... how long I been out?
Where's Ronnie?
Well I don't...
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Let me say somethin' first...
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
You some kind'a pervert?
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
I said... STOP!
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
I can handle that.
They sure liked them devilled eggs.
You take it straight?
Want another?
We drinkin' buddies now?
Still makin' jokes?
Tell me what to do.
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
What is it?
Get'chu at that table up yonder.
By myself?
Yeah, gal I been here before.
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
Don't think that'd be wise.
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
What I love.
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
I don't want you to let go.
This Rae... you get with her?
Shit. Who hasn't?
Uh-huh.
He tapped that.
Naw!
How a girl get like that?
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
Or what?
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
Not like that.
Heard about this morning.
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
You won't at the square this mornin'.
So...  That your first time?
You a preacher?
This ain't gonna work.
Rae don't do this now...
Hey.
Holy shit!
What happened to your face?
Got in a little accident.
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
I just wanted some make-up.
You got any money?
Thought you had a man for that.
Alright. How much you need, ho?
The hell you call me?
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
Hey, hey, where you goin'?
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
Back-up.
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
What are they doing now?
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Who do you think the Jap is?
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
Some party.
What are you doing?
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
What'd you say?
Nick... You up?
Nick, have I been a good partner?
Go to sleep, Charlie.
Hey, when in Rome --
Let's go.
Nick, we can't just --
Let's grab some food.
This should be it...
This the right place?
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
Squid?
Joyce can be nice.
You cool, Ich?
Cool?
All right, how's the new partner?
High spirits, desire, commitment.
You'll take care of that.
Give me a break, would you?
Where do we start looking for this guy?
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
Nick!
Give us a break...
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
Why the hell not?
Why weren't you at the platform?
You must leave?
I've continued working on the case!
How'd you get this?
Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo.
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
Did I say that?
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
Yakuza.
She disappeared... shit!
Gaiijin.
Nick --
I want to yank Kobo.
Where does this Sugai live?
A resort city, Beppu.
Because he knows how to get to our man.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
It's very small.
Big enough.
No...
Let's go.  Him first.
Nick, you can't do this.
Start it.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
How many men?
I couldn't tell.
I don't know.
Someone attacked him.
Thank you.  You have one?
A wife.  She left.
I'm sorry.
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
You all right?
Yes...
Think we'll get him, Nick?
We can't lose.
Don't give him any more.
Ich said you left.
Dead gaiijin's are big news.
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
You can count on the truth from people who don't like you.
You have a helluva way of asking for help.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
She ever pull down her shades?
Don't be an ass.
He's on duty.
I need your help, Joyce.
Where's Ich?
I need someone to translate for me.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
He drinks.
Where's the wife?
I don't remember saying yes.
They want your autograph.
We're in?
You'll get Ich killed.
I still think you're a bastard.
What if I chant?
Might be different in New York.
Keep the change.
I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky.
Guess I'm on a roll.
This is my stop.
I'm amused.
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
How big a package we talking about?
This by this...
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
It's not your job.
I want a gun.
It is not allowed.
We're police officers.
Could you fill me in?
Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.
You had my help, detective.
I have to get to Sugai.
I want him.
You trust me?
That wasn't our deal.
You want him dead too.
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
He knows what he's doing.
Where?
What's the point?
Not to be trapped.
One man.  He must be good.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
And what can he do for you?
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Would you like to be modified?
What's the problem?
I want more life, fucker.
I've done some questionable things.
Why are you staring at us?
What, Sebastian?
What generation are you?
Show me something?
Like what?
Of course not.
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
He could?
His company made us.
When do you deliver your project?
Where are you going, Sebastian?
What's going on down there?
He's not ready yet.
When?
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
I think, therefore I am.
I didn't like her.
Yeah.
She's not with you?
Yeah.  I got it.
It's gotta be right for my customer.
Well, when do you get paid?
Soon as I finish the job.
When might that be?
Day after tomorrow.
Why, yes, of course.
I know all that.
What about a summary then.
Do you have something against science?
Not if it works.
And what in your estimation works?
Four years.  Which would make her termination date...
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
I think I have no money.
It's okay.  Forget it.
But I would like to buy you drink.
Shot of vodka, please.
Thank you very much.
You want to see my friends?
Sorry, don't have the time.
Those cockroaches?
Prosit.
I like you.
I like you too.
One more, eh?
How old am I?
No.  I got a problem.
What's that?
Nerves of steel.
What if you change your mind?
Why didn't you go?
Too old.
My job is here.
Taffey Lewis?
Yes?
What did she want?
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
What the fuck for?
It's a good job.
The best.
Does it eat?
Jeezus!
Are you apprehensive?
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
I'd never get an abortion.
Why not?
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
In your opinion.
I've already got more help than I need.
Do I make you nervous?
Yeah.
I can imagine.
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
You ever take a bath with a man before?
I told you I'd come back.
Me and my dad.
Where is he?
Dead.
How are you doing?
What do people do in the afternoon?
Do you dream?
Yeah.  Sometimes.
Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
You're sick, Deckard.
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
You mean a woman?
Uh-huh.
What's a long time?
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
What difference will it make?
Where the hell you been?
What's up?
Thanks.
Black?
May I ask a personal question?
If she is, the machine works.
I'm tired of this.
Don't move.
Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...
What?
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
A tortoise.  What's that?
Know what a turtle is?
Of course.
Same thing.
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
How come you were in my truck?
What's your name?
Pris.
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
You want to go home?
I don't have one.
Where are your folks?
They left.
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
You look... better.
Just better.
Beautiful.
And you live in this building all by yourself?
Methuselah Syndrome.
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
Is that why you're still here?
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
What makes you think so?
Hi!
Oh, now, that's a great one!
You like it?
Bravo!
This is my new friend...
I'm Adam Webber.
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
Come where?
For how long?
Let's go talk first, Adam.
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
Please excuse this interruption.
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
Bon soir, mademoiselle!
Get out of here!
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
No, I'm lost.
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
I just had a mental picture of...
I came on a bus.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
So far?
Yes, I'm right?
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
You don't?
Yes.
And that's it?
Wait!  Wait!
What is it?!
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
How's that?
Oh, I could die...
Hey, what are you doing?!
I can't, it's yours.
Take it. damn it!
Why are you doing that?
I haven't brushed yet.
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
No.
Watching television in color.
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
See, ya.
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
How long would you need me?
Two weeks.
What's the pay?
They like Dr. Pepper.
Who are these people?
My Mom and Dad.
Wait! Wait!
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
I guess we'll need another locker.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Then forget it.
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
This is for me.
A wife?
Yes.
What for?
I don't want to be alone.
Bites what?
The big one!
It does?
Sure.
They're all divorced?
It didn't used to be that way.
One who's not a mutant.
When do you need her by?
Of course.
Get out!
Now, get out!!
Yes, ma'am!
Stop that ma'am crap!
You almost got us killed!
I told you I've never driven before!
Never drive again!
You said it would be easy!
I was wrong!!
Yes!
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
I thought only hookers drank those things.
He has a computer?
Sure.
May I please be excused?
All right.
The guy with the underpants!
About clothing?
No!  Not crazy!
Do I look crazy?
Not that one!
I like her.
No way.
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
That's ridiculous.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
Adam?!
I don't blame you!
I'm leaving, too.
What?
I know first aid!
There.
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
Hi, Eve!
Is that a birthday cake?!
Yes, it is.
What?
Yes, sir.
Yes.
I've got to go, now.
How do I leave here?
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roul!
Like a painting?
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Then why go there?
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
Oh, boy! A jacket!
C'est bon, Monsieur.
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
Yes, father?! Yes?
...the pipe tobacco.
Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore."
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
That's what everybody believes?
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
You have very nice ceilings.
I love Lucy!
And it's called...?
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
Right on the button.
Who use to own it?
What's the capitol?
Juneau.
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
This must be very new.
Yeah.
I don't think so.
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
I'm not wearing his pants.
Why not? He has great pants.
I just don't want to.
Almost all of them.
Why did you park way back there?
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
You bet!
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
Good-bye, Adam.
Bye, Troy!
Bye, Adam!
You dial nine to get out.
Of what?
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
My father is a genius.
How old are you?
Thirty-five.
You don't look thirty-five.
How old do I look?
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
What?  What is it?!
The sky!!!
The sky?  Where?
Up there!!
I don't see anything!
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
Whatcha looking at?
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Say what?!
How do you do, ma'am.
I do alright.
Hello.
Oh, that would be wonderful!
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
Oh. A nice one, I hope.
Elbows, Son.
I'm afraid you've got to.
I'll be all right.
Are you in trouble, son?!
We have to go.
This is your bedroom?
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Well, where are you --
No.
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
What about relatives?
He drank it hot?
Yeah.
You got a light, honey?
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
Well, put it down and come in!
No.  They all do.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
How long will we have to stay down here?
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
Home sweet home!
What's that noise?
The locks.
Thirty -five years!
Then after that it's safe.
To go up.
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
I'm not hungry.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
Would you like a tranquilizer?
You have tranquilizers?
Oh, no.
What?
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
Yes!
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Watch this!
Hi, honey!
Calvin!
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
What did you wish for, Adam?
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
Let's eat our cake.
If we still have one.
Would you excuse me?
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
Should we say a little prayer first?
Yes, yes it is!
No.
Yes.
We stay down here.
We do?
Yes.
Well, I am the head of this household--
--and we will--
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
He's smart.
What are you bitching about now?
What are you doing here?
I forgot some of my stuff.
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
Stop it, you two!
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
Give me your hand.
Well, that's blunt!
I see "elegant."
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
That water's freezing!
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
He go back to the hotel?
What's that mean?
We did not leave together.
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Where are you going?
To bed.
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
Yes, you do!
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
He didn't leave with them.
He left with Sophie.
I don't think so.
Oh, no!
Gay.
What do you want to do with it?
Give it back to him.
And if we can't find him?
Have him committed.
To get some frozen poultry.
Then what?
We came back to the house!
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
Adam!!
Where?!
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
Buy it from me?
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
Are you Detective Williams?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Come into the study a minute.
Jeffrey?
Okay.
Anything you can tell me?
The criminals are winning.
What is this? What color is it?
What color is it?
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Is Sandy part of this?
No, not at all.
Who knows you have these?
Only you and the photo lab.
You're all through with this now?
Yes? What is it?
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
I wanted to see you.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
Well.
THEN WHAT?
What do you want from me?
I, I don't know.
Do you like that?
No.
Nothing. Are you alright?
Sure I'm alright. 
Don?
Thank you. honey.
Yes.
Yes.
See my nipples?
You can hit me, if you want to.
Do you like me?
No.
You don't?
Hi, can I come in?
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
Oh shit.
Nice guy. Who's he?
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Look.
No.
Who is Don?
Don? Are you in with them?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
No. I should go.
Come in.
It used to make me laugh, but.
Yes. Frank--
Do you like my body?
What do you want to do?
I'm doing it.
Are you a bad boy?
What do you want?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Does that scare you?
Shut up.
Beeeee careful.
I asked first.
I love you Don with all my heart.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I did. Are you?
I guess I should go.
I want you to stay with me.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Oh no.
It's okay. It's okay.
They hurt his head.
Who, Dorothy?
Hold me, Don.
Don? Where is he?
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Bull.
Alright, suit yourself.
Hello, baby.
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
Hello, daddy.
MOMMY!
Mommy's here.
Yes, but.
Look at these. What are these?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Those are my breasts.
Can I feel 'em?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Hello?
No thanks.
I don't want to go.
Go where?
Hey? You like to walk.
What are you lookin' at?
Okay Frank.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
There ya go.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Well. Okay.
Do you want the car?
Can I use the car tonight?
God, you scared me.
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Yeah, I know.
Would you like a piece of cake?
He comes over to study.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
That sounds great!
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Sandy?... Sandy, please.
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Are you feeling okay?
Good to see you, son.
How ya doin' Dad?
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Am I bothering you?
Yes.
How is Central these days?
Terrible boring.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
What happened to him?
I guess I'll see you sometime.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Alright.
Are you alright?
So, what's next?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
That sounds good.
Here's to. An interesting experience.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Oh, okay, can I call?
Okay, yeah, call.
What's with Mike?
He got a little jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
You want a Dairy Queen?
You saw a lot in one night.
Actually. I've been in twice.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Yes.
Did you see her undressed?
Who, me? Why should it?
That's what I thought.
Okay, be careful.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Okay, okay.
Goodnight.
You were late.
I'm really sorry.
What am I going to do?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
Yeah.
You like mysteries that much?
Okay.
What is it?
What was that all about?
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.
It's okay.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
You want to dance?
I can't dance fast.
Let's wait for some slow one.
You want to dance?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Dorothy Vallens?
Probably not. No. Why?
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Jeffrey? What's going on?
I should go with her, Sandy.
Sandy?
What are watchin' this junk for?
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
I need Il Duce.
There's ways around that.
Lord's name.
Mother Mary, full of grace.
Are ya ready?
I can't find the second one, sir.
Look under the body.
Any tips on where these guys may be?
Where's your gun?
Chest pocket.  Shit!
Anybody you think is evil?
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
What are you saying?
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
What the fuck are you doing?
What? What is it?
Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!
Look again for fuck sake!
Shit.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
You guys?
We're here brother.
Hello.
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
No ma! No!
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
Be careful.
What are you going to do?
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
Fuck!
me up the...
Hey Murphy?
No fuckin' hot water man. That...
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"
Absolutely not.
Destroy all that which is evil...
For what?
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
I don't know they just always need it.
Nervous?
A bit.
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
Where the fuck are you going?
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
Yes.
Who did you kill?
So what do you think?
We've teamed up with a sex offender.
He isn't to be touched.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
We do not want your tired and sick.
It is your corrupt we claim.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
Rule of thumb?
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
And number three, Dolly.
Uh... two shooters!
So, what do we do now?
She was in here when it went down.
Can she I.D. them?
They were wearing masks.
Maybe the three of them had something in common.
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
How do you figure?
What?
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
Pee...Per...Man.
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
It was... It was...
So what are you thinkin' here?
The what man?
And the pennies?
The Greeks. The Italians.
Who the...
Twist of lemon!
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
How many bodies, Greenly?
Who were the victims?
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
Oh my god!
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
Promise me boys.
Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.
Hey. You don't know that shit for sure.
Hello?
Hey Murph.
Roc. You okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Hello?
Hey, Murph.
Roc. You okay?
No. You sure you're okay?
Hurry the fuck up!
This is some crazy shit, man!
Liberating isn't it?
Worst day of my life, man.
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
What the fuck do you mean?
You bet your ass he will.
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
You believe?
Yes.
You feel?
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
I believe these young men are right.
You know them personally?
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Don't do this my son.
Open it!
Father, I'll do you right here.
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
What do you want me to say?
Just be natural, goddamit.
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
What color hair does he have?
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Making Hutch David Soul?
Right. The blond guy.
OK. That's wrong.
Dignan, it's --
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
What does Starsky say?
He says. This is he.
This is he?
Did you see what I meant about the window?
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
Would they do that?
She's really kind of hot.
It's got a V-8, Dignan.
Where are you going?
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
Did you see that?
Yeah, I saw it.
I'm lookout.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
It had an alarm.
Yeah, I heard that.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
Eight dollars.
But he didn't say anything.
Is it back in?
Loop around real fast.
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
Where's the manager?
Where's the other stocker?
There's another stocker, right?
Is that the manager?
Like he meant it.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
What's wrong with him?
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
Can I get that credit card from you?
Because my mom gets the bill.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
I don't want to use it.
Well, then cut it in half.
See if mine are in there.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Yes, they are.
Look at the treads on those.
What about them?
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
I'll just say it.
I'll say it.
OK. Go ahead.
You owe me fifty bucks.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
Hi.
Inez, this is --
What the fuck is going on here?
Which one was that?
She's from Cuba.
As long as he gets out OK.
Obviously. That's a given.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
He's gone. He stole the car.
Where was it parked?
That coward. Son of a bitch.
He went back for his brother.
When'd he tell you?
This morning.
Where was I?
He told you and you let him do it.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
I can't believe he just jumped you.
I wish I'd been there.
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
She doesn't need to know.
You don't know how to hotwire.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
I think we better go home.
Don't panic, Anthony.
We've got sixteen dollars.
Sixteen dollars.
I know.
How much?
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
That's what she is!
I know that. But --
When'd you get back?
Who's in the car?
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
I want you to look at this.
You could give somebody a concussion.
What do you think?
Dignan. Take it easy.
He doesn't want to fight.
Get out of the way.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
Eleven fifteen.
OK. Mark that down.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
He was a nice guy.
Do you like Inez?
As a person?
Yeah. As a girl.
Yes. I do.
Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow.
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
You're all clear.
We all set?
Take your second position.
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
I don't know.
What's happening? What's going on?
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
It's going back down.
Nobody move!
Where's Kumar?
I don't know.
What are you doing?
You're kidding.
Come on.
I'll see you there.
What?
I'll see you there.
What are you talking about?
I'll get him.
There's not enough time.
Dignan, it's too late.
Like amnesia.
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
He did?
You got to be kidding me.
I'm not kidding.
What'd he get?
Pretty much everything.
Why?
What do you mean?
You're living on a sailboat?
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
How big is it?
Where?
What's he in for?
You're kidding.
No. I'm not.
How?
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
Nice to meet you.
That's a sharp jacket.
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
Congratulations. You passed the test.
That was a test?
How does that feel?
Did Dignan take the test?
Yes, he did.
Me?
No, that door over there.
I don't want to die.
Exactly. Woah.
We're renegades from despair.
Future Man.
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
In your backyard? How do you protect them?
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
Could you grow cinnamon?
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
Let them fight.
See you.
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
There's a million places to hide around here.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
I hope not.
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
You think he got my license plates?
What?
Bob, where you going?
I'm not playing any more golf.
You think I'm improving?
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
Were you adopted, Bob?
Why do you say that?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Was Future Man adopted?
Let's not even talk about it.
Give him a second.
Jesus, Bob.
Yeah.
It's in the driveway.
How do you say nineteen?
Were you born in Mexico?
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
What?  What?
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
You're Anthony?
Uh-uh.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
What do you mean?
Where'd they come from?
The front stairs.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
Is that him?
That's Anthony.
That's your friend Anthony?
Yeah.
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
What?
Are you a fag?
Well, what do you think?
I'm not allowed to drive those.
Not even for emergencies?
They are.
So who's going to know?
That never would of --
What are you talking about, Bob?
You stole a Trans-Am.
Yes. I did.
You're paranoid, Bob.
I can't believe you said that.
What did I say?
The guy is fucking insane.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
I think we might of scared her.
That's my responsibility.
That's your domain.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
I paid for it.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
This is natural.
Did we get it?
How much is there?
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
Bob, will you please listen?
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
Way to go, Bob!
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
It's registered in my mother's name.
What the fuck possessed you?
Bob. Are you coming?
You can go first, Bob.
My brother's in jail.
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
How long has he been in there?
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
What do you mean get back?
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
This could be a trap.
Come on, Dignan.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
I'm going back.
Give me the keys, Dignan.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
I know it's not.
You don't even know his name.
Yes, I do.
What is it?
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.
Dignan.
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
Come on in. What you been up to?
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
You said 48 hours!
I never agreed to that.
Bob, you're lying!
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.
I'm sorry, Bob.
Come on, Bob.
I know it, man. Hang on.
Scarecrow?
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
What's wrong with Applejack?
Is he breathing?
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
Where's Applejack?
Applejack drove.
Do you have your own room?
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
Do you have your own cell?
Hold on --
Wait a second --
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
How you doing, Bob?
He said what?
He said you ran away from home.
26 weeks.
And what does that cover?
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Ground defense.
Is he in?
What do you mean grammar?
Is he good?
Join the party, fellas.
Yes.
Why?
Where did he go?
What's the story?
Can't get it. It won't... 
We're closed, sir.
Where's that guy going?
He left his sweater.
Where is he? Where is Rob?
Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?
No. I just have short hair.
Is that your chiquita?
No, my friend knows her.
You like Chicanos?
You a good pool player.
Got a little lucky.
I don't know.
What?
No. Just pool.
You Hoto?
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
How's the weather down there?
Mr. Henry?
Come on in!
It's locked.
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
The world needs dreamers, son.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
Pleasure to meet you, John.
You told me Bourne was dead.
Save it for Bourne.
Treadstone.
Never heard of it.
And what are we looking for?
Sorry to wake you.
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
Did he say anything to you?
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
'Why' would be enough for me.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
Why not? It was just money.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
Had to be done.
She say what time I should call?
It was staged?
Who else knows about this?
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
Then what?
They loved you.  And I killed them.
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
You know I'm not.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
I can't let you do that either.
I have to go now.
Is this really happening?
I emptied it.
So why didn't you kill me then?
What do you want?
Conklin.
I don't know.
Who sent you to Greece?
Pamela Landy?
I don't know who that is.
What's going on in Berlin?
You called it in?
-- car keys?
-- my coat -- but we should --
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
Conklin up front.
I'll get the book.
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
Sleep. Sleep now.
No... How?
The Telegraph office.
But we were so careful.
But you're sure?
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
We can't wait to be sure.
-- where's left to go? --
You drive.
What?
Switch! You drive!
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
-- not yet --
What if it's not who you think it is?
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
I love you, too.
I wanted to kill him.
But you found another choice.
I know it's a dream.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
Yes.
Who is Pamela Landy?
You hear me? I believed you.
What is this, a game?
So when was I here?
No. You never worked Berlin.
My first job.
Your first assignment was Geneva.
No... Jason... please...
What do you want?
Okay, how do you want to do it?
Oh, shit...
Why am I alive?
Don't need it. I remember everything.
Sounds like a threat.
We need to get in there.
Looks like he's been detained.
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
-- go -- take the van! --
Alright... take it down.
We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
You're sure?
Show me.
Here?
This is everything? Is there.
-- who? -- who else is here? --
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
That's where we came out.
Amnesia?
Am I a doctor, no, but...
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
What do you think? Is he coming in?
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
Are we hacking or asking?
Yes. In that order.
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
We must sue for peace.
Peace?!
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
Young Robert, we are honored --
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
He won't come.
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
Wallace has sacked York!
His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
Good day to you, M'Lords.
I'll wait... back there.
The Bruce is not coming, William.
Stephen ready?
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
Rest, William.
I rest.
That's just a dream, William!
They're coming!
How many?
Armed?
Wanna stay with me tonight?
I wanna have supper waitin'.
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
Test of manhood.
Good to see you again.
A common thief.
We must run in different directions!
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
I have faced him. Have you?
Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
Thank you for accepting.
I want... to marry you!
I... accept your proposal!
I'm not just saying it!
This night is too beautiful to have again.
Then when?
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
And I with you. But you must wake.
I need you so much! I love you!
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
I am the Princess of Wales.
I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
Peace is made is such ways.
You will die! It will be awful!
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
I must... consult with my father.
We can't stop!
They've tricked us.
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
Fine speech. Now what do we do?
Come, it'll help you sleep.
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
Darn it!
Um... can dad come this time?
You know the answer to that.
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
Honey. What were you doing with that?
I don't know... I don't remember.
Something must've happened! What set him off?
I don't know. These things take time.
I found these. The others are still in storage.
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
Dad lives here?
Are you hurting her?
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
Where are my goddamn books?
Books?
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
I thought you were a December baby.
What the fuck are you doing?
Are you stupid or what?
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
Huh?
Oh God... what did we do?
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
Ouch.
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
Not since we were kids.
I've stopped a hundred times.
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
What do you want to know, Evan?
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
It was a long time ago.
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
So it didn't feel... weird?
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
Are you okay?
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
I get it. You can drop it now.
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
Why's that?
I just thought you should know.
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
We'll find out soon enough.
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
Just don't drop the ball, okay?
And you are...?
Smells like sex in here.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Can... can... Can I have this?
I couldn't cut the rope.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Hey, what'd you do that for?
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
Look what you made me do!
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
Just get out, didja?
I thought I was the bad guy!
Lenny? Come on!
Shut up, Tommy!
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
Monsieur Rick?
How did you get in here? You're under age.
I came with Captain Renault.
I should have known.
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
Does he know that?
Yes, Monsieur.
And you want to know --
-- Will he keep his word?
You want my advice?
Oh, yes, please.
Monsieur Rick, I --
Thank you, but I hardly think --
Good.
What is your name?
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
Yes, Monsieur.
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
No thanks, Carl.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
Goodnight.
But Sacha always puts out that light --
-- Tonight he forgot.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
Here you are.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
Here's to you, sir.
Er, good luck, yes.
I'd better be going.
It's not for sale.
It's not for sale at any price.
What do you want for Sam?
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
And Mademoiselle?
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
We said "no questions."
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
And I was wondering.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
Has it got a wow finish?
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
How did you get in?
Richard, I had to see you.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
Put them on the table.
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
Everything is quite all right.
But why my name, Richard?
Because you're getting on that plane.
It's been a long time.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
You are very kind.
This time they really mean to stop me.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
Be careful.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
He does. Could we have a table close to him?
What happened with Rick?
Our faithful friend is still there.
Did he give any reason?
He suggested I ask you.
Ilsa, I --
No, Victor, there isn't.
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
Be careful.
Sam?
He came from Paris with Rick.
Hello, Rick.
Well then, perhaps you also ---
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
How do you do?
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
And I congratulate you.
What for?
Your work.
Thank you. I try.
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
We'll come again.
My office.
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
I beg your pardon?
I said, ask your wife.
Well, this might come in handy.
Thank you.
Had a close one, eh?
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
My bill.
Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.
We'll be there.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
May we proceed with the business?
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.
I believe you have a message for him?
I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
For the time being.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
Ho, diplomatist!
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
Mademoiselle.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
What is the meaning of that phone call?
Why? What's in Lisbon?
It was a combination of all three.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
I stick my neck out for nobody.
Yeah? What's his name?
Victor Laszlo.
Manages what?
His escape.
This is the end of the chase.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Why two?
He is traveling with a lady.
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
I have my orders.
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Oh, no, Rick never --
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
Oh, thanks.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
I have the letters right here.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
You think of everything, don't you?
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
Our expenses?
Where were you last night?
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Will I see you tonight?
Give me another.
Sacha, she's had enough.
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
Come on, we're going to get your coat.
Make it official, if you like.
What is your nationality?
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
Hello?
Get me the Radio Tower!
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
Rick! Rick, help me!
I like it fine here.
Boss!
No.
No.
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Good. Then have a drink.
No. Not me, boss.
Then don't have a drink.
Boss, let's get out of here.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
Shut up and go home, will you?
Just a little something of my own.
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
Where is she? Have you seen her?
It's bad.
Worse than Warsaw.
Save some for tomorrow.
Get up.
Feels so good to lie here.
Can't.  Need water.
You've had today's water.
Do too little you'll die.
No more water, you said.
Take it.
No.
Take it, damn it.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.
Get water!
Fix raft first.
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
Why do they have to die for me?
I'm lost.  Goodbye.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.
What's so damn funny?
It's real.
You can't make it.
You know what happened to this?
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
Yeah.  A long time ago.
They're harder to do than they look.
Oh?  You've tried?
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
To tell you the truth -- you did.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
No.  that was the last one.
Keep painting.  Promise me.
What brings you out to the sticks?
Had a package to deliver.
I had it on the island with me.
Yeah, a long one.
I've got lots of time.
How was Russia?
Got to follow the paper path here.
Merry Christmas eve.
Four four.  A record.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
He is a cute thing.
He's your cute thing.
I can't even keep fish alive.
You know, for when you travel.
You can't go now.
I have to.
"We're" not over-reacting.
Could you watch Jango?
That's your dog.
I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away.
Get back?  From where?
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
Right back, you said you'd be right back.
I got married.
I thought you might have.
I would never --
I know.
Her name's Hannah.
What's that, written on the sail?
There was a coffin?
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
That about sums it up.
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
So simple to say, so hard to do.
You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged into something.
You okay?
What will you do?
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
I love you, Chuck.
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
And how was your Christmas?
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
If you say you are.
Thought you were going to bring her.
What happened to your pants?
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
Mom, this is a farm.  We've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream.
Don't you even think about it.
The place is falling apart.
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
Kamal is not here.
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
What's going on down there?
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
You what?
I'm touched.
I didn't know we had sailboats.
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
Hello?
It's me.
I beat the odds!
How about we go somewhere else?
You were how long on this?
To Wilson.
To life.
That's all there is.
Digital laser readers.
Take your time.
That's what it's about.
What, then?
Thanks.  For everything.
Permission to come aboard, sir.
May I ask, where are you bound?
San Francisco.  And you?
Only if you can afford it.
I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!
You weren't dreaming about me.
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!
They just want you to hire some new help.
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
I'm *not* a doctor!
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
You cook very well!
And that I can drive a truck!
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
What'd she die of?
What are you going to tell the little ones?
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
So, Mrs...
How many months are you?
Is your family in the apple business, too?
I've never seen a lobster.
Where's Mandalay?
Burma!
People watched the movies in their cars?
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
I *know* this was right.
It will be okay.
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
You don't understand! It's her father...
Mr. Rose *knows*?
I know, I'm sorry.
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
"...did." Well, okay.
Do you think she'll be all right?
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
Hi...
I can't go nowhere.
Wally thinks apples are boring.
I never said they were boring.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
There! You said it was boring.
I love you, Wally.
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
They wanted a girl.
You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
That's true.
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
Nobody special enough, Curly.
You mean somebody asked?
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
So here is my candidate. What do you think?
I just wanted to ask you...
Is *your* father dead?
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
But did you know him?
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
What's a nanny do?
She looks after other people's children.
Did you grow up around here?
No. She was an immigrant.
What's an immigrant?
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
Uh... it's the end of October.
Did you bite it?
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
What kind of plane are you flying?
A B-24 Liberator.
Liberator...
Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
Where are you going?
I think I'd probably like the apple business.
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
They're migrants.
It's almost like flying.
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.
First pregnancy?
Yes, for both.
It's obviously an aborticide.
Christ, it's oil of tansy!
Where's the name sheet?
Nobody's named this one yet.
He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
I don't think so.
I thought it was my turn.
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
"One: Please don't smoke in bed."
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
Rose Rose?
What's that?
Give men that. I know how to do it.
You're not yet three months, are you?
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
That's *it*?
Who cares?
Now, now. He's a good boy.
Shit. We don't know what he is.
No autonomic effects... that's correct.
When will he be home, Major?
They told me I was too old to serve.
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
Mind your own business, Peaches.
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!
Don't this place look like home?
You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
I told him that you all is sick.
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!
You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
Rose Rose has runned away!
She took off in the night!
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
What do you do over at your bank, Grant?
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
We had to finalize the deal.
Everything looks in order.
This has to happen fast.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
Let's just slow down for a second...
The standard ten.
Ten percent. Of how much?
Know who I am, Jake?
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
Gee... What makes you say that?
Your life flashing before your eyes?
Just the last three weeks.
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
It's all about the money, isn't it?
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
But there were other factors.
You're a superstitious fucker.
We were back on.
After you cut her loose.
Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?
It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
Ten is standard, sir.
The red hair... It's bad luck.
I'm going home
I told you, use less powder.
What? I can feel you looking at me.
It can buy you a new and better you.
You know what we're doing with the money.
When?
You gotta be kidding me. Her?
How much we going after?
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
How's that? He works for Gillette.
She up for this?
Calls?
So that's it...
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
I have a good crew.
I can't do that.
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
How much?
I need you to stake me.
Come here. Feel this.
No thanks. I'm good.
Come on. Harder.
I think I just broke my hand.
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Something stupid.
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
I can't be here! You understand? I can't --
What -- What do we do?
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
No.  What's my cut?
You get an equal cut.
What do I have to do?
What about Customs?
What the hell's his problem?
What?
And some new clothes.
You're just going to have to trust me.
I don't trust anyone.
He's gone.
I gotta go get a haircut.
It's what I do. It's my job.
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Do you have something to prove?
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
How do you deal with --
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
What about...
What about what?
You tell them the "Tale".
What do you want? An apology?
Your mess.
Then shut up.
Stop waving that thing around.
We're working for the King.
Uh...
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
We never had a problem with that before.
Him.
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
I'm sorry.
You going to have the time?
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
What?
What happened?
Eee Oott Auught!
And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...
Pretty much.
In over your head?
Can I speak to you in confidence?
Then who's the Banker?
It's not history.
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
The King, huh? Nice going.
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
You guys awake?
What do you get out of it?
Peace of mind.
That's it?
You sell it.
It's just insurance.
That's what I'm talking about.
I'm Bella.
Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.
Is it that bad?
Jack. Do you need a ride?
No. Thanks.
My car's in the garage.
Maybe another time.
You're shaking.
I hate cheats.
Why did you quit?
I got scared.
You called the casino a cesspit.
Ouch.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
What kind of deal you looking to?
How about five hundred.
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
Eight-fifty.
She went back to South Africa.
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...
I want a job, Giles.
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
I'm working on that soccer story.
I'll try and make it.
I found her in bed with someone.
Who was he?
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
Good night?
Not particularly.
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
Not entirely.
I couldn't resist them.
You want me drunk?
You really are a beautiful woman.
Where did you get it?
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
You're my prisoner.
I've got something to tell you.
I want to hear it.
In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
Are you trying to read my palm?
What's the time?
How did it go?
You're shaking. What is it?
Tension. It'll go.
I loved it blond.
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
Are you drunk?
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
What about a drink on the way home?
I'm on at nine.
I don't like it.
It's the truth.
The door, Jack.
Leave it.
It's beautiful. Thank you.
I hope it brings you luck.
You were talking in your sleep.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
Gambling's not about money.
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
There was a message, wasn't there?
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
Nothing about you.
Here...use a spoon.
Why did you take the money?
I hate public transport.
I want to buy a car.
Great.
Found a job?
Yes, I know that.
Don't let yourself down.
I've lived there.
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
To coincidence.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
Near the casino.
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
Absolutely not.
Toss you for it.
How did you hurt your hand?
Just an accident. Nothing.
He doesn't gamble.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
Which side do you like?
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
I'm in trouble.
What kind of trouble?
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
They mean it.
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
The point is, they want a man inside.
And I thought you were a bright woman.
And I thought you were only after my body.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
It won't.
But if it does.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
Next time it'll be my neck.
Wait a minute...
How much do you owe?
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
I'm sorry.
What for?
Is it yes?
Yes.
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
Do you?
That bruise has cleared up nicely.
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
And your hand too.
Would you like a drink?
Hello...
Detective Inspector Ross.
Who...
Ross.
Of course I recognised him!
You've been avoiding me.
Have I?
I'm Lucy.
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
Where to?
Where do you live, Jack?
Over the river.
Nice car.
You've done pretty well.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
And the girls?
Just girls. What are you drinking?
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
Does Bella come here?
Hey Jack, join us.
No thanks.
Don't worry, I won't report you!
Rough day?
What happened to Bella?
I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
I put them on together.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
Where did you go to school?
We check every four days.
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
Any exceptions?
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
You use two alternating, don't you?
We do. 
Where's the magnet?
Haven't you forgotten something?
I don't think so.
Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched.
What happens if I want to sneeze?
How many aces are left?
Five.
I make it six.
Ever?
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
You can start Monday week.
I just want the job.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
Does he win?
Thanks for the information.
How do you feel, Jack?
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
What's he doin'?
The key!
Key?
Where's the fail-safe key?
Where is it? What did you do with it?
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
The key, goddamit, the key!
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Where is the key?
It didn't go off.
It didn't go off.
We've got to disarm the bomb.
What the hell?
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
Quantum is up thirty-five.
Rechannel all safety relays --
Talby, Talby, can you read me?
Check at six minutes.
Energy shielding positive function.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Detonation in twenty minutes.
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
You are false data.
Huh?
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
Well of course I exist.
But how do you know you exist?
Right!
Why don't you have more time?
To explode, of course.
Hmmm...
So if you detonate in...
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
I have no proof that it was false data.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
Pinback...
Yes, Doolittle.
Doolittle...
Any planets?
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Any of 'em any good?
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Commander Powell would have named it.
Fred.
Out where?
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
-- open circuit breakers --
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
-- automatic channels open --
-- Remark.
Hello, Pinback, are you there?
I need a diameter approximation.
I like it up here.
You know what I think about, Talby?
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Doolittle! Help me.
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Yes sir. Negative effect.
What was that, Doolittle?
Negative effect.
It didn't work?
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Commander? Are you still there?
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
Sir?
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
Sir?
Men... men... what happened, men?
Who are you?
Bruno's girlfriend.
Oh, yeah?
Man, you got a bad attitude.
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
What?
How come I never hearda you before?
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
What the hell are you doing?
Who's Camille?
Some of us are trying to sleep.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
Move it.
How're ya doin', Max.
You mean until you showed up?
What is it?
It's a sweep.  C'mon.
Lemme put some clothes on.
Out there.
But I'm afraid of--
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
Same old story.  Not interested.
What're you looking for?
I ain't mad at you...
I don't get involved with guns.
I'll make it worth your while.
You're light a deuce.
You didn't...
Damn... Are you alright?
They took my daughter.
Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
Can you help me get her back?
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
But why can't we stay here?
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
Sophy?  Are you okay?
Mommy, where are you?
When?
Soon, baby.
You're a thief?
Girl's gotta make a living.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
So this guy walks into a bar and says...
Sorry about your window.
Lemme get my coat.
How'd you find me?
Lauren's not my wife.
I won't be staying.
It was open.
Bent?
How do I know you didn't?
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this.
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
You need to get out more.
The other ones?
The other one like you...
A girl.
Your basic hodge-podge.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
What's this?
I don't know what to say.
You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.
Know where I can find her?
You don't want to.
I need to talk to her.
Who is it?
A friend of your fiance's.
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
Look, I don't know what you want--
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
You're also a fool.
This is not a place you wanna go.
Say the words, "I understand."
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
Got a pencil?
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
What guys do.  'Nother order.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?
A little what?
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
Gotta go.
Where?
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
Unlikely.
And because he's my friend.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
Please...
They're prisoners to their genes.
They don't have a lot of moving parts.
Only one I can think of.
I actually know how this works.
And she bought that?
Can you put that in a bag or something?
Playing hooky again?
Feel like the dog's dinner.
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
Tell everybody hey.
Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
Hey, Sketchy--
We gotta talk.
You left out condescending.
I'm the victim here.
I'm a toy to her.
She tells you how I've been--
How'd you get her out of town?
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
Okay, okay, okay--
I was on call. 
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
He's sick.
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
Thanks, miss.
What the hell is that?
Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
No, I mean... you love your son?
More than anything in the world.
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Hawk.
Pick a song, Hawk.
Got any KISS?
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
No problem.
Sorry.
Jeremiah?
Beth? I can't believe it.
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
We've got to take this slow...
Right, slow...
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
What's it worth to you?
Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
What are you, high?
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.
Any luck?
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
Shit, that dork is Jam.
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
We are not stealing my mom's car.
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
Now, how are we gonna do this?
What the fuck!
I think we should try sneaking in.
I found the Volvo.
No... You don't think...?
Could be.
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
Jam, listen up.
It's my Bullworker.
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Oh, hi, mom.
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
Grounded for the rest of the year?
What?!
That's it?
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
Oh, yeah! You and what army?
Gimme your gun, boy!
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Not if I shoot first!
Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
Is that your final answer?
I did?
Good morning, mongrels!
GOOD MORNING!
Are you AFRAID?
Hi... what's going on here?
What was his name?
Yeah.
Like a DeLorean.
Like a spear.
When can I squeeze one out?
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
"The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
Dea ex machina...
What did you say?
Why did you make me flood the school?
Who is... we?
You'll know soon enough.
Where did you come from?
I want to show you something.
You have to do something for me first.
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
What happened to your eye?
I am so sorry.
Hey...
Hey...
Wanna walk me home?
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
Why is that?
You're weird.
I'm sorry.
Will you go with me?
Where are you going?
Donnie?
And what?
Well...
That's alright... I understand.
We're moving through time.
They suspended me for two days.
So, we call them... IMGs.
What? How long was I asleep?
What's wrong with you?
Will you please talk to me?
Hey.
Hey. You OK?
My mom is gone.
Come with me.
No. Frank.
Is that a cellar door?
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
You're such a fuck-ass.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
Grandma Death.
Do they know yet?
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
Oh, shit!
You're my only son...
Who is Frank?
Why should we care?
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
So, I met a new friend.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
His name is Frank.
How so?
Don't you watch the news?
He said to follow him.
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
I met a girl.
Gretchen. We're going together now.
How are things going at school?
I think about girls a lot.
I asked you about school.
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
How many times have you seen Frank?
Four times... so far.
How does that make you feel?
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
The good stuff.
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
But you were punished.
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
What else makes you feel regret?
If God exists?
Why?
Because I'm so horny.
Where are we going, Donald?
How is that possible?
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
What is going to happen?
Frank is going to kill.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
It's called "The Philosophy of Time Travel".
Yeah.
What's her name?
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Why would I tell Mom?
Because you tell Mom everything.
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Come again?
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
If that's what you think is necessary.
Our son just called me a bitch.
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
Excuse me?
That's enough.
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
Yep.
How did this happen?
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
Do you even know who Graham Greene is?
Rose.
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
What is this shit?
Wicked.
No more fuckin' for her.
Is Mom okay?
She's alive, sweetie.
Where is she?!
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
Really, Loretta?
This came for you, sweetie.
What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
Loretta, don't do that.
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
I gotta work with these women.
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
Amber? Here.
Yah?
Mrs. Leeman?
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
C'mere. I love you so much.
Bye mom.
We was robbed.
I hate her!
This, this... This is bullshit!
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Here, I didn't get any.
Hi...
Here, I'll take it. It's my job.
Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
Okay... well, bye.
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
Are we on "Cops" again?
You could be quiet.
Hi.
Oh, naw. Hi.
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
Shut it up, Loretta.
Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
All right, they're makin' a movie.
You don't know where this is gonna...
We was robbed.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
That's right.
Okay?
Yeah.
Dakota.
Ohio...
That bitch from...
What?
Wisconsin.
So what was the theme of the pageant last year?
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
And the year before that?
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
This pageant's like a roach motel.
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
...You betcha. S'posed to be colder- n-a witches tit tonight...
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
So help me, Gladys.
...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.
Oh! What is it?
Uh, Gladys?
What!
We need more bars!
This is -- what?
Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
Harold!
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
He should be king!
And wear a crown and everything.
Here I am, Father.
Take a letter.
Who to?
Is that all?
I'll have to enclose the check first.
Here I am, Father...
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
Father...
I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?
Yes -- why?
What's the matter with you?
Hey you!!
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
What kind of a dog is he?
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
Well - what is he now?
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Half watch dog?
I don't call him, I whistle.
What do you whistle?
Oh no, I can't do it.
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
Did you shoot the rapids?
Then you don't wanna work hard?
You get half mine and I get half yours.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
Why wasn't I insulted?
She did.
You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
Now -- how many men you got in your army?
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
Fine.  We gotta him. 
All right -- I'll go out and find one.
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
It must be done right away.
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
Are you sure you're not tired?
Excellency, may I present my niece.
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...
That's what you think.
You worm!
Once more! 
Then it's war?
Yes.
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
Bah!! 
I don't remember.
Oh -- you mean... worm?
No, that wasn't it...
Was it -- swine?
No... it was a seven letter word.
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Take a seat -- you're next. 
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
Oh, would you...?
So that's the one you want to marry.
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
Mr. Merrick, sugar?
Yes please, two.
One or two?
They have noble faces.
I've always thought that myself.
You won't be long?
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
John loves the house.
You stay with me.
More romances for John?
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
Yes?
I found it.
Our man is sick. Come right away.
What is it?
What are you going to do?
Don't!
What happened?
He fell.  He falls.
He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
I want my man back.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
You don't own this man!
Good morning, Treves.
Good morning, sir.
You've acquired a taste for this?
It's quite nutritious, sir.
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
Oh yes?
Do you think they'll go along with us?
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
I am very pleased to meet you.
How long has this man been here?
I say Freddie, what are you about?
I don't know what I've got.
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Oh, no.
She's very pretty, your mother.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
You've never been?
Have you read it?
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Oh no?
You alright?
y-y-yes--
Want to come out?
Of course! You want out?
Yes.
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
Thank you... very much.
What's this?
I'll have to find some more.
Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.
...Yyes
Yyyess.
Yes.
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
Hello...
My name is...
My... name is...
John Merrick.
John... Merrick
Say "Merrick".
Merrick...
Say "Mmmerrick."
Say "Mmmerrick."
Righteousness...
John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm.
Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
Good evening. How are you feeling?
This... is my new home?
Yes.
The hospital?
You look splendid, John.
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
That's a canopy, John.
Ohhh...
Oh yes.
Who are they of?
Oh, our relatives... the children.
The children! May I see?
The Children. Where are your children
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Your mother?
Yes, John?
You want a dressing bag, John?
...my... home?
Yes, John.
You did this for me?
Is it the one you wanted?
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Stand up, John. Let them see you.
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
Oh yes! It was wonderful!
Then I shouldn't change anything?
The workhouse.
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
No, he's very upset about something.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
Yes sir.  What's that?
A dressing bag.
Very smart indeed.
WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
Are you the proprietor?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Pardon me?
So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
Open up! I know you're in there!
Ah! It's my father!
Right! Where is he?
Well... where is he?
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
It's all right! It isn't happening!
WHAT did you say?
I said welcome.
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
Please! Please! What are those?
What are what?
WHY?
Yes.
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
It was different...
What was she like?
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
But you LOVED her all the same...
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
I've never LOVED anybody!
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
"The fifth one this week"!
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
Five this week; how many the week before?
You're as bad as my father.
Who?
Halfdan the Black.
Just give me a hand.
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
No!
I'll bring it back.
But you don't realize....
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
Of course.
The second note.
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
How do we know this is the way?
We blew the Horn Resounding.
What do you see, Erik?
I see the world.
Is it night or day, Erik?
It is day, of course, Freya.
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
Is there nothing men can do?
And will the dead ever return, Freya?
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
Would you like us to sing to you?
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
A lot of people like our singing.
I'm sure it's lovely.
But you don't want to hear it.
We're just not a very musical nation...
Well, how d'you think I feel?
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
Don't talk nonsense.
He wants to kill US!
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
But it IS! Look!
Looting and pillaging, eh?
Yes.
What about the raping?
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
Oh, get it over with.
I don't suppose... no...
About raping me?
You DON'T like it, do you?
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
Scream.
Ah.
Louder.
You told them I raped you -- why?
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
Why should you care?
What a stupid idea.
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
Why should you care?
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
"But" what?
But...
It's Halfdan the Black!
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
Let's hack her to pieces.
Halfdan the Black's here!
I know!
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
We're missing all the fun...
What's it all about?
You talking piffle, son?
Who have you been talking to?
I met this girl...
It's always the women that start the trouble.
She got me thinking...
I... I... KILLED her...
I want to die...  No, I don't!
Faster!
What are YOU doing here?
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
Look, the sky is blue...
It's magic.
What "magic" have you brought, Erik?
What did he say?
You must help us.
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
But you're the Gods!
Thank you VERY much indeed.
Now stop it!
You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time.
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
A magic dishcloth.
Weren't we supposed to?
No! Let go, Snorri!
I've got you!
You'll be sucked down too!
There is another way.
Who gets killed?
What's the matter with them?
Just say something cheerful.
Wait, Erik!
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
What do you think?
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
Well, what else do we do?
Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!
What are you talking about, Erik?
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
Hey, you two! What's going on?
Look, I bagged it last week.
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
I AM one, Dad!
She hasn't got any.
Hy-Brasil?
I came to find my grandfather.
Bye, Leif.
Bye... sorry...
Yeah... well...
You will wait?
What's all the panic about?
It can't do you any HARM...
How did he do that?
Do what?
Vanish into thin air?
He hasn't.
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
Same thing, isn't it?
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
Are you all right?
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
Aaagh!
Let me go, Sven.
I'm not worth risking your life for.
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
Well! Come on!
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Get away, Snorri.
Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
Can't make enough swords!
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
My brother blacksmiths!
That's right.
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Together we stand!
Wasn't it, Keitel?
Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?
Sh! Hurry!
Relax!
Help!
Help!
Shut up!
I should have got rid of you long ago!
It's a tradition.
But it's a responsibility...
Not now, Sven...
I must KILL! Kill!
KILL! KILL!
HOLD it! HOLD it in!
Well, of course he is!
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
Well, go on! Go berserk!
He drove me mad!
Well I'M certainly not, either.
Well... I'm game.
Thorfinn! You can't die!
I'm not frightened... of anything...
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
No... he's not... not... there...
And you've got BOTH axes?
Yes, Mother.
And something to sharpen them with?
No, Mother.
And keep your sword greased.
Thanks, guys.
Yeah.
Yeah, you told me that later.
And I just liked you so much.
No, it was lovely.
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
Ms. Kruczynski?
How are you today?
Okay, I guess.
You were not.
Come over after I'm done here?
In the room?
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
I'm sorry.
Why?
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
I don't really know how --
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
Huckleberry Hound?
I don't know what that means.
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Joel? It's Joel, right?
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
Probably see you at the book store.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
It's okay.
You know Wilmont?
Yeah.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
You like that?
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
I'm fine.
What do you want to hear?
You pick it.
Well, I should probably get going.
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
Okay.
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
You'll call me, right?
When?
Yo ho ho!
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Let me drive you home.
How can you watch this crap?
Where are you going?
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
I don't think we're ready.
I don't want to talk about this here.
So, um --
No, it isn't that.
More?
Joely...
Yeah, Tangerine?
Such a beautiful view.
What if you hide me?
There's this guy!
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
Happy Birthday.
I scoured the city for it.
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
This is our first "date" date.
Do you remember what we talked about?
Naomi, I guess.
Yeah.
Right. Something black though.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
We did talk about Naomi.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I'm sure, I said.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
Come up and see me... now.
It's very late.
Is that what you want?
Well, you're married.
I remember that speech really well.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
Hi there.
You know what I did.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
Oh God, how horrid.
I know.
What do we do?
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
I think she's great.
I think, before.
Seems too coincidental that way.
I wish we did. You married?
Um, no.
Male or female?
Cool.
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
It's dark.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
Bye, Joel.
So you'll call me, right?
Yeah.
I think I should go back.
Make love?
Have sex. Y'know --
I'm nervous, too.
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
Says you were a bully...
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
I don't know.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
What took you so long?
I just walked in.
I guess so.
Hi, it's Joel.
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
Guess what I'm wearing.
I don't know. Panties and --
Your dried cum.
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
Hi.
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
I just got in.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
It's them.
I should maybe talk to you.
Clementine.
You have to stop this!
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
Hi.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
So you don't mind?
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
I had a good time last night. I really did.
We'll speak soon.
Oh, hey, Patrick.
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
Boo.
Stan... c'mon...
Sorry. I just --
See you later, alligator.
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
It's freezing out.
You found us okay?
It's stopped.
What?
Well, what should we do?
He's coming?
You better go.
Do you swear you didn't know?
How did I look?
Oh.
Hi.
What do you want, Stan?
Nothing.
I know what it is.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
Mary...
Order me a pastrami for after?
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Thanks.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
It's no big deal.
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
I have a family, Mary.
You made me have an abortion.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
He went home sick.
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
Mary. What are you doing here?
Did you try going through C-Gate?
Howard, they've disappeared again.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
The voltage looks fine.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
What's your bartlett's?
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
But I don't know how to polka.
What was that?
Clockworks.
What do you believe in then?
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
I don't.
No, I guess not.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
What do you think?
I have to go, Julian.
Are you in show business?
I was a successful model once.
So now you're bummin' around?
Yep.
Hitchhiking?
I'm the best.
Bonanza Jellybean?
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
That means top-secret, Cooper.
I can see why they sent you along.
...do you copy?
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
Holy shit...
Time to play Spam in the can.
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
We have a man down...
Coop, where are you...
The containment, Second Containment...
But Justin...
...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
Will it work?
Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
Coffee.
No, he didn't.
I don't know what happened to Justin.
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
Is that an offer?
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
What...?
Do you hear it? Right there.
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
Please... kill...
What's wrong?
What's happening...?
Pressure?
90 over 50 and falling... .
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
Does he know that?
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
What does?
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
How do you know all this?
You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
Justin, finish your sweep.
Patch me through to him.
Justin.
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
I can see the hatch.
The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
I found one.
Alive?
...how's the client?
Skipper...
Peters...
...you okay?
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
That's a negative, Starck.
Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
Where has it been for the last seven years?
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
No one?
If it worked.
I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
You have something, Dr. Weir?
What about it?
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
What do you want me to say?
I don't know...
We're leaving.
Don't... don't do this...
You... You can't do that!
I told you... She won't let you leave...
Weir is dead.
Then who the fuck are you?
What are you?
I'm not the Devil.
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
Jesus...
Heading three-three-four...
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
Yes, sir.
We've got some weather.
1500 meters. We're getting too close...
It is now.  We're locked in.
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
Do we have enough time for a weld?
Captain, we got a problem.
Skipper...
Smith, get out of there...
No, no, we just got her back together...
Where is it, where is it...
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
That's an affirmative.
Everybody okay?
It tastes bad.
How much oh-two do we have?
Oxygen is not the problem.
Maybe one of the original crew?
No. It was someone else.
Miller...
It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
Miller, come in...
What's going on in there, Starck?
Weir can't be alive.
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
I'll do it --
We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
Weir.
He's been past Mars?
He served on the Goliath.
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
No. I saw nothing.
There's no one in the corridor but us.
He's engaged the override.
Keep him talking.
Almost got it.
You got any coffee?
Where is she?
The safety circuit's failed!
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
If they are, they're screening their calls.
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
What happened to his eyes?
Explosive decompression.
Miller, do you read me, Peters --
Get them back --
What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
A straight line.
What is it?
Claire is your wife?
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
What are you doing?
What is it?
I don't think She's real big on hate.
How'd you know it was me?
I'm not really dressed for a party.
Relax, it's casual.
We're going to have to work on your touch.
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
I wouldn't know anything about that.
You look like an eighties rock band.
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
He didn't.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
Where is Reed?
What are you doing here?
I'm worried about you.
Ben, come in.
What is this? Where's Reed?
I can't take this.
He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
I had it at four.
Isn't that your speech?
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
He's smart, powerful, successful --
What the --!
Ben. Are you okay?
We had a tough year.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
We're working as hard as we can --
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
'Course not. Strictly business.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Reed?... Sue?
Hey! That's a prototype!
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
You're hot!
So are you!
Me like-y.
I though we went over this.
You're on fire!
Not this again --
He's not responsive --
Now what is up with that?
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
This is wrong in so many ways.
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
Back it down, Johnny!
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
But all these people...
Apparently I can disappear.
Stop it.
What is that thing?
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
I'm driving.
You two need a time-out.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
They're ready for you, sir.
Leonard, how's the feed?
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Feeling better?
Yes, thanks.
Which was?
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
What? What do you mean you --
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
That's what we're here to find out.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
And reverse the mutations --
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
I can... make it work.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
I found a broken gasket, from space --
Come on, Ben, come on...
Ben did this.
Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
What are you doing?
Raising the shields.
What's going on?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
Please don't make this personal --
Oh, I think you already have.
Of course.
How much did they cost?
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
It's the first door on your left!
On the ledge?
First door on your left!
Easy, mon.
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
This is how I dress all the time.
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
Hi, Brad.
Mom says to clean up the pool.
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Your friends use the pool too.
I take out the garbage.
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Where did you hear that?
I'm just guessing.
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
I don't know. I was just curious.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
I didn't say that.
Are you still a virgin?
Does Mom know you have company?
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
They were left over from the last shift.
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Yes, sir.
Leave me alone!
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Leave me alone.
Nice to meet you, Stacy.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
Do you have any ice tea?
Pick a suit.
Are you really a virgin?
You're a really good kisser.
So are you.  Are you shaking?
Hey, Mike?
What? Are you all right?
I think we're making a lot of noise.
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
Oh. Hi.
I didn't see you this morning.
Why don't you call me up tonight?
Take that back.
We've got to get an abortion?
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
It's definitely your mama.
All right... where did you see her?
No.
I would. Yeah.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
Hey, Rat.
Yeah?
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
Damone. It's Mark.
Damone, are you there?
Well, I've gotta be running.
Poor guy.
No Damone. I don't understand.
You're losing it, Damone.
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
Are you Linda Barrett?
And they don't call my parents?
Not if you're over sixteen.
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
How often do you go?
Who's that?
Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.
He is.
Seen the new Playboy?
Naw. Any good?
Suzanne Somers' tits.
All right.
What the fuck is this guy doing?
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
My brother's car!
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
Just be glad you're all right.
How's it going.
He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
No way! He just called him a dick.
Do you think guys find that attractive?
Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
What's the big deal?
Well I never did it.
Was it great?
It was okay.
You'll always remember your first time.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
Climax together.
Does that ever happen?
How long does Doug take?
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
What do you think?
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
What do you think it is?
What do you think it is?
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
That little prick.
What do you want?
Where's Doug?
He's not coming.
Sometime?
Yeah, like maybe never.
But what are you going to do?
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
Yes.
Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
I couldn't make it in time.
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
I think I've made my point with you tonight.
If you graduate.
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
What can I get for you tonight.
Thanks for picking me up.
Thanks. So do you.
Where do you feel like going?
I don't know. Wherever you want.
How about the point?
The point sounds fine.
That's a nice shirt.
Are you really nineteen?
I think I better take you home.
What about those other guys you live with?
We keep them.
Thanks for coming to get me.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Do you know what you want?
Are you all right?
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
Do you want to come inside?
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
...I've got to go home.
Do you really have to go?
What's April 16th?
It's John Bonham's birthday.
What about the notes?
Hi, Mark.
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
Anything to drink?
Two Cokes.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Let's have lunch!
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
Naked!?
Naw! Not a major.
Where ya comin' from, young man?
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
Oh, my God!...
We're your friends. We're not like the others.
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
...and we're chock full of that!
Where's the medicine?
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs...
Why?
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
That's what gives me The Fear.
Not much. Why?
I have to go.
GO?
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
When does this thing stop?
Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
How about a check?
I want that fucking radio!
You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately!
WELL? What are your plans?
Plans?
Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
Like big lizards.
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
Lucy is looking for you.
No, she's looking for you.
Where'd you get this?
Some of what?
Right!
Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.
Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.
The airport is over there!
May I see your license.
Could I have that, please?
Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
In that case, maybe she can help.
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
You know where it is?
Where are you two going?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
IS IT CLEAR?!
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Well, it don't look pretty.
I don't think you should...
We shot a skunk.
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
Wha?
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
And that's how I ended up here.
They're right here.
We just smeared a skunk.
Fuck you too.
Scared?
Ohhh.
What?
So, what now? Did those things leave?
Any more ideas Animal Planet?
You weren't helpin'.
We're better off.
Come on!
What now, Geronimo?
Your brother, huh?
Yep.
Your parents of relation?
I'm in.
We're going to get help.
We gotta try.
We gotta be close.
What's in the back?
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
How are you holding up?
What is this?
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
Doesn't your foot hurt?
Um-hmmm.
You wanna see, baby?
Sure.
How much you got?
My husband...
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
He's dead.
He only shot you once.
In the kitchen, under the sink.
What?
What?
What do you mean what?
Is it gassed up?
Fully.
Four door?
Two.
Covered.
Holds four.
Max?
Seven.
Nine?
Seven.
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
Sit still, look less like a meal.
Welcome back.
They were all over the place.
Bullshit.
Clever fuckers.
Blow the goddamn hatch!
Got 'cha!
'Eh, Chief?
Fine, Chief.
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
What?!
Move slow and move quiet.
Move it!
Shit!
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
SHIT.
COME ON!
Yeah, maybe.
HELP MEEE!
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
Am I too heavy for you?
OH JESUS!
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
Yeah, I'll go.
What's wrong?
Let's go.
DON'T!
Let's wait it out.
If you are face to face with her, dive left.
And the last one is the...
Hold it!
Let's go!
Go! Go!
Not without you!!!
Get to your cars!
Oh my God... What is that?
You know you don't have to do this.
I'm fine, I really am.
I admire your strength.
Her name is Charlie.
Did we make it?
Um, well...
Are you lying to me?
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
Frances?  Oh no.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
What're you doing?
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
I guess so, sir.
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
No, I'm concerned with everything.
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
Hi Frances, got a minute?
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
I'm not!
You're afraid!
Good, good. Give them that.
Madam...?
Okay, but come here first.
Hello, Harold.
Frances.
Where's Clifford?
He's not here.
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
Who?
An actress.
A rich actress.
What does Clifford say?
Hey, where's the fire, sister?
Get your clothes on, lady --
GET OUT!
You learn your lines?
Sort of.
There've been some calls.
...Yes.
Without me.
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
Harry!
We're all square now, Harry. Right?
I know you believe that.
No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
Were you an alcoholic?
No.
Were you a drug addict?
Bye, baby.
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
I didn't have much to do with it.
You wrote it, didn't you?
It's already started, Dad... with me.
What do I do, Dad?
You really want to go?
And you think it's worth all this?
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
Please, Francie...
Are you... are you hungry?
Bread?
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
Good.
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
Oh, Kurt!
You can always come see it in London.
Only if you were in it. Are you?
Are you really serious? About acting?
Why... yes.
Then don't go to Hollywood.
You sound as if you hate it.
Aren't you ever going back?
They'll mend.
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Harry.
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
You think I'd miss it?
How'd I look?
Enh.
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
What?
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
Frances...
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
Oh no...
Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
Harry... I met someone.
Serious, huh?
Shit. I meant the other way around.
Well, the studio told me not to.
The chauffeur. He's watching.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
What's left of my blood.
Think I'll have a glass.
Nice joint. Can you afford it?
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
I took the early rounds.
No, Harry, I can't -- 
Take a walk, pal.
Oh my God, I look awful.
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
That's right.
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
You know something, Harry?
What's that?
To quarter-horses.
What's that?
You give up on her?
Frances, You're crazy.
Anyway... if you need me...
Frances! Frances!
Who?
I love you, Harry. I love you.
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
How did I look?
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
No.
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
And no people.
Where you goin'?
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Yeah.
Shit!
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
Did you expect him to look you up?
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
What happened? Who're you?
Who're you?
But I want to. I'm trying!
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
How's it sound?
The speech? Real good.
You think I got it?
I don't care.
It's okay.
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
Then why did you bring them?
It's your fan mail, little sister.
You kill me, Mama.
What?
Well, who have we here...?
Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.
Where are you going?
How long will you be?
I'll have lunch ready by one.
I'll be back.
At one. Promise?
Say you promise.
Yes, Mama.
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
Don't... talk crazy.
Where are you going?
I'm going out!
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
Excuse me.
Yes...?
Don't I know you?
It ain't for lack of trying.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
And what's that?
...Did you really say that?
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
This whole thing is a joke!
Is there something else?
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
Symington says...
No! No!
What?
Yes.
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
You drove him to his torment.
And he drove me to mine.
Nice.
Better that way... for me.
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
You're an outcast.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
Friends? Do they live around here?
Yes. Very close
People can be kinder than you think.
Kill me and have done with it.
Your crime... as well as mine.
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
What can I do?
Yes. I want this over and done with.
What is this?
This was not taken from a grave.
You will honor your promise to me!
She's beautiful.
Poor William! What indignant tears!
Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
You dance so beautifully together.
Nothing. Still nothing.
So have I
Are you all right?
Have you seen Willie?
Don't cry, Elizabeth.
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
Father's so proud.
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
I'll have to do better than that.
I've loved you all my life
This feels... incestuous.
Brother and sister still?
I wish to be your husband.
I wish to be your wife.
You make me weak.
Our decision. Together.
Your decision. For us.
I give you my soul...
Victor. I love you,
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
I thought I'd never see you again!
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
Why the change? What about your work?
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
Brother and sister no more.
It's going to ram us.
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
Professor?
I am not mad.
Henry Clerval.
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
Only you would think of that!
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
They just caught the man who did it.
They'll hang him all the same.
Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
I resent God's monopoly.
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
Quite a place.
Thank you, Henry.
What happened up there?
Paracelsus?
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
What is your name?
Professor Waldman.
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
Are you a physician?
Creature? A... human like creature?
You know of it?
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
Do you share my madness?
The killer is still out there.
What'd you see?
Tomorrow is another day.
Melvin Belli.
Good night, Alice.
Any particular reason?
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
You want to leave?
Next Friday.
You think you're gonna last all summer?
Oh, my God...
Filmmaker.
What'll you do when you leave here?
How the... did he get in there?
Good point.
Help you clean up?
I don't hear it anymore.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
It sounded like Brenda.
Where?
I'll go check on Brenda.
Jack?
Marcie?
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
What's the matter with it?
You said we were special.
You know what I said, though.
Somebody'll see.
Let's go back, Barry...
What the hell?
Give me a hand?
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
You saved my life.
I had to.
What is it?
Roll him over!
Chance to get even?
You just had some lucky shots.
What hath God wrought?
How about our last jay?
Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
I love you.
What about Neddy?
I don't love Neddy.
Ned!
It's just a dream.
Are you wet?
Mmmmmmmph?
Mmmmmmmph.
Best over...
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
Cowboy.
Girls can't be cowboys.
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
You okay?
Anything else you want?
I got to.
How much do I owe you?
One night on the town.
Good luck.
Another coincidence.
How many with you?
Just my son and I.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
You said it was just you and your son.
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
So do I just follow you?
Yeah, follow us.
So let's do it.
What's this guy's problem?
What are you gonna do?
You don't believe in suicide.
What's your name?
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
Not a chance.
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
My wife.
Where is the little lady?
In heaven.
She's dead?
Yes, she is.
How'd she die?
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Is this real?
Real McCoy.
You're a preacher?
I was a minister.
Was? As in not anymore?
Yes.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Yes.
Didn't like it, did ya?
You won't let him touch her?
Pass.
Why not, against your religion?
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
To your family.
Now, is your shit together?
Did he...?
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
There's nothing wrong with this place.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
I promise.
I'm going for 'em!
No!
What?
Where are you taking us?
What's in Mexico?
What you said to me in the room.
What did I say?
Yes.
Do you believe me?
Yes.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
Daddy's dead.
Watch my back!
How many bullets left, kid?
I'm sorry.
-- you got your microwave --
-- you got your sink --
-- you got your shower --
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
What do you want from me? I did what you said.
Were you giving that pig signals?
He says you were scratching.
I wasn't scratching!
Whiskey!
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
You believe me don't cha?
Gotcha!
Do they have cable?
No.
Feels good.
All I'm saying --
What'd ya see?
Cops.
Where's the woman?
She's in the other room.
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
Is it me? Is it my fault?
Seth, if you were me --
Yes.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Richard!
What does that mean?
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
Keep your voice down.
You okay?
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
They broke when you fell.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
That's what you think?
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
I'm lookin' scared?
That's what you look like.
You know what you look like?
No, Richie, what do I look like?
How?
Where are you right now?
What do you mean?
Where are you?
My shit is together.
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
How are you?
Thank you, ensign.
Who's "we"?
I've been accused of that wish.
The woman I saw you with...
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
Administration, Ensign Blondell.
Don't say my name.
Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
Got it.
Wow...
Your prerogative, Senator.
Standing right here in my office.
Thank you, sir.
No, sir.
Same rules for everyone, sir.
Straight up?
Then good night.
See me, sir?
Permission to leave, sir?
Aw, what is this...
Fine by me, sir!
Entering my scan now...
Smoke her.
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
White House boys want a private meeting.
So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
"Coronado."
Uh, question, ma'am.
You know him.
It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
What changed?
I'm sure it is.
I'll work on it, ma'am.
Hey.  You okay, Flea?
I can make this wall without --
Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
Unless you Whiskey Run.
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Probably hear back from CNN first.
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
So why're you even considering it? Are you?
This has nothing to do with you.
Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
Jordan.  You watch your ass.
All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
"In Washington..."
I'd sure like to know who.
They're more afraid of you.
And how do you know that?
Hey.  Way to gut it out.
You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
He was married?
At first.
You got anybody, Wick?
That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
Do you, uh, know...
What're you guys doing?  Huh?
She part of the training?
32 feet, six inches!
'Cool?
Say again, sir?
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
"Dad."
Any brothers?  Sisters?
Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
Would you have shot if it was a man?
We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
Do you?
No.
Good to see you again, too, sir.
Say again?  How many micks?
Got it.
O'Neil...
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
Clear.
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
We're fucked.
Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?
You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
This ain't workin' right!
Subject?
O'Neil, Jordan.
Thought you two were file-closed.
You knew about us?
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
That's cuz I'm married to you.
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
Who the hell are all these people?
Me!? You where the one...
Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
He stole my report! That's my report!
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
My God. He's going after the nest.
What are you doing?
Don't you think we have enough?
Think we can fit up in there?
He's not going to do it.
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
I'll take them all.
So you made it.
Most people don't.
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
I got pretty close.
...he's pregnant.
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
How do you know?
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
You'd be surprised.
Who was that French guy, anyway.
I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
Did Romeo have a name?
What the hell are you doing?
What's it to you?
Can I use some?
What do I get?
Five bucks.
Did you talk with Humphries?
This is not the place...
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
Mr. Caiman, you're married.
And you're beautiful...
Mr. Caiman...
I can't.
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
Oh, I'm not married.
Really? A girlfriend then?
Not for a long time, now.
Well, I think you're cute.
I'm sorry about all this.
Merde!
They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
We've secured the doors on both levels.
Where's Luc and Pierre?
Have them sealed off.
You're fast.
Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
What sample?
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
Are you looking for this?
Do I know you?
We've met before.
Sounds like a big company.
It's the French Secret Service.
Why are you telling this to me?
I need you to trust me.
Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
What's with the chewing gum?
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
I think we should leave now.
Who the hell are you?
Hello?
It's Raymond.
Well good, that's very... nice.
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
Just don't.
This is it?
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
You WILL go out there.
I won't and nothing you say-
"The show must go on."
God, what an ass.
At ease men.
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
Go ahead!
What?  What?
Nothing.
Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
"Purple skinned monstrosity...?"
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
~hex!  Alex, are you oKav?
Not again...
What the hell is going on?!!?
Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
What's happened?
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
And note the sucked in gut.
He's a miserable twit!
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
Alex you can't -just leave.
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
Why didn't you stop at the market?
A boy comes to the door.
We heard it the first time!
May I get the check?
"Go into the cloud! ...
I don't know.
You said "the Commander.
He always has to make the big entrance.
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
What's  your name, son?
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
Yes Commander?
What does the Omega 13 do?
Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
Okay, now. But-
No, wait, are you-
Lt. Madison, GO.
Shit! Go!
Go. They're off again.
I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
Structural damage at 68 percent.
Yes?
What's the weather like outside?
There is no weather in space.
The ship is sustaining structural damage.
The enemy is matching velocity.
Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
Systems register functional.
U.... What do you think?
A hologram...
Never mind, Fred....
As good as Hopkins?
"Crewman #6"... Call me Guy.
THAT'S why you built this ship?
Where are the miners?
Yeah, what is it?
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
More to the left... Stay parallel...
"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.
They're gone.
Not a clue. You?
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
What?
It's Jason...
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
Only answers to me.
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
Can it be repaired?
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
You're playing your good side.
How does the rolling help, actually?
Clenched jaw...
Jason.. Can you hear me?
What?  What did he say?
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
He's accelerating to Mark 6.
never doubted you for a second.
You're kidding. When for?
You gotta admit, they do love him.
That's it, It's go time.
That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
Stop, please! I don't know!
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
We pretend...
Simpler.
We.. We lie.
I... certainly, but-
Home.
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
An interstellar vox.
How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
Weapons storage...
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
NO, Thank God he has not.
Then how did he find out about the device?
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
"Deception..." "Lies."
But there it is!...
A model, only as big as this.
Could be this.
Do your best, Tommy...
What kind of signal?
Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
Oh, right, sorry.
Sorry Guys... It just went off.
How about the pig-lizard?
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
It doesn't have eyes.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Let's do it, Tommy.
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Continue forward, sir?
WHAT? WH
Because they're coming right at us.
Some say that Hessians are invincible.
Over three hundred miles.
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
Go on... I want to hear everything.
Is that a fact.
You, you just need a new flint, General.
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
What?  What are you talking about?
Me?  You apologizing to me?
Wil...
Yes, my lord.
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
We've got powder but no ball!
How old are you, Captain?
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
Horatio!  Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.
Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.
Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all.  Quite the character.  He's got a tremendous reputation.
Makes you gag.
Gag on your own invention, then.
Oh, come now...
I doubt Arnold will be afraid.
General Lee is detained captain...
Detained by what?
Unofficially, General Greene.
My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold?  He's up there.
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
The man is a traitor!
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
I... they look both the same.
I only meant...
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!
General Lee, sir!
It's another demonstration against the king.  This is the wildest yet.
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
Martha!  For God's sake!
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
I want you to see our hospital.
Colonel Washington?  Colonel Nathanael Greene, Rhode Island Militia.
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
General Greene?
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
Well, this must be about something!
You know very well who it is that I love.
George, you know I only love you, but...
You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
Where... do those men come from, George?
Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
What are you doing?
Let's get you darker!
I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
That's good... who?
All people have rights!
Just because they are born?
Yes!
Who says so?
I say!
The land here is best for grain and corn.
Juba was a Numidian.
William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff.
What is this?
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
I reserved a Cadillac.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.
I guess still in the locker.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
You get the money?
No. What's this?
Trade for what?
You get life for kidnapping.
I have to ask you for that key.
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
I think I pulled my quadriceps.
About sixty.
Where is my nephew?
Your who?
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
What's this movie you're doing first?
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
There's Ilona.
Get something going there.
I really think I can be of service on this one.
I need the money.
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
In just a second. Two...
I don't believe this.
You know Laurel Canyon?
Where's Karen?
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
I can't do it.
You positive about that?
I'm working on a few things.
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
C-18.
What I been wondering is where's he been.
Ray Barboni?
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Okay. So who are you?
Or else what?
What?
Look at me, Ray.
You say look at you?
Yeah? Which terminal?
Who the fuck are you?
He owes me money.
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
You live in Miami?
That's right.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
I'm in the movie business.
I'm a producer.
You have a card in here?
Have we met? I don't recall.
That's what I'm doing.
Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
A marker's like a check, Harry.
You're not looking at me, Harry.
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
That's it? That's your movie?
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
I'm not the guy, Harry.
You pack a gun?
Not really.
What does that mean?
Maybe a few times I have.
Once.
"Mr. Lovejoy".
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
You don't even know these guys.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
What do you get out of this?
I had to tell 'em something.
Here's your keys, Harry.
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
Yeah, he told me.
What Get Away jet?
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
Yeah. That was a good party.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
So you want to know.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
I'm thinking of a movie.
One of mine?
One we're producing.
Wait. How about this?
How about this?
What's that?
I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
You've been losing.
I'm up twelve grand today.
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
How'd you know I was here?
How? By taking my money?
It's all mine.
You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
The door from the patio, in back.
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
You been here the whole time?
I got you a copy of the script.
Then you've read it?
I want to know.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
Harry... My God...
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
Are you going down?
I don't know.
You're as bad as Harry...
Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
Were you scared up there?
You bet.
I'll be right back.
What took you so long?
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
I told you not to -
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
He already knew it.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Whatta you doing out there?
I'm going into the movie business.
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
You seem to feel fine about it.
What's wrong?
Be quiet and listen.
I don't have a dog.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
Harry -
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
Harry, we spoke with Martin.
'We?'
Lufkin. His... agent.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
A passenger liner. Over.
A passenger liner, north island. Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem.
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
You think the extra strain caused it?
How about now?
Sixty pounds.
What? You sure?
That's what it says.
Damn mind of it's own.
What day is it?
I don't know. Tuesday?
You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
One more?
What is your first name?
Maureen.
What?
Maureen.
Roger.
You think that's funny
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Ready?
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
Last thing we want is extra partners.
Guess I'll just keep working.
What're you crazy?
Maybe that is his boat.
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
Try Wednesday.
Did you?
Dodge.  Dodge.
What?
Get up.
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
Mother fucker!
What is it?
What's this?
I thought you said it was just a blade.
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
How much longer's that gonna take?
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
The right way and the wrong way.
But how long?
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
Three, four days.
Went aboard.
It's a hell of a lot of money.
Sounds like the hull.
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
Damn barbaric is what it is.
That'd be my guess.
Dodge to Murphy.
On a passenger ship in 1953?
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
I don't know what you're talking about?
I think you know.
The radio!
You smashed it!
What?!
Don't lie to me!
Conveniently enough for you.
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
If money can buy what he wants.
You're late.
Sorry.
Don't fall asleep.
What's slow?
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Could be a fishing boat.
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
You mean, before she sank.
Then why didn't they take it.
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
Coffee.
Stay away. Or else.
Any dizziness?
Headache, nausea, lights?
Lights?
Sudden flashes of light.
What?
Candy?
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
She was sailing up north, right?
You're more practical than superstitious.
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
Take it easy, you'll live longer.
What guy?
There's somebody else on this boat.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
No cowboy shit up there, understand?
Got your light?
Murphy to Epps.
Epps.
How's he doing?
Same. Any luck?
The ah... the radio's out.
Smashed it up pretty bad.
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
It's not gonna hold us.
Hey.
Hey.
Couldn't sleep.
What do you think happened on this boat?
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
Victims of what?
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
That much I think we've already established.
What's that supposed to mean?
Epps, over.
Epps? You there?
Over the gold.
What happened?
We hit land.
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
I think I see it pretty well.
Greer to Murphy.
Of course they did.
Let the buyer beware.
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
I must be in the wrong business.
You got that right.
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
Too deep to anchor out there.
It's funny.
Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
Morning.
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.
So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
I heard that.
What now?
We could call for help.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
Never been more thirsty in my life.
How're you feeling?
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
We're not gonna be able to pump it!
It's a Noaa buoy.
Can't find the shotgun.
What about the gold?
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
As I said, what seems to be the trouble?
These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.
I thought you say Tuesday.
Better late than never.
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
That cost me twenty grand at least.
Have you seen my blue spatula?
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Will you get off my back for once?
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Who?
Guess.
Someone from the past.
Who?
Give up?
YES.
Maxine.
Not the Maxine?
Yup.
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
What is it now?
Pumpkin? What's wrong?
Pumpkin, are you in there?
About what?
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
But I can't --
Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
And what can you tell us about this... 
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
Did you actually do this painting?
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
...wow...
Well, yes...
Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.
Huh?
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
What the hell is wrong with you?!
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
It's not optional!
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
Jesus, look at this guy.
Hi Josh.
I just stopped in to say hi.
Hi... what's up?
Why?
Then why do you hate me so much?
When did I say I hated you?
That's just the way I am!
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
Hi Enid.
Hey Josh.
God, what a bunch of retards...
Shut up!
What? Why?
Why?
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
Much later.
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
Okay, okay!
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
Hi, Al!
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
Does Oomie really like this show?
Hey - why do you have this?
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
Look at how cute I am!
Look, that's back when I hated you.
I remember every minute of that party.
Which loser?
You know, the green cardigan guy.
Why do I always have to do it?
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
Look, maybe that's him!
I want to "make love" to him.
SHUT UP!
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
What's going on now? What's he doing?
Are you sure?
He's insane!
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
Ew, look at this...
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
Not really...
"Funky"?
Let's go hassle Josh.
There he is...
JOSH!
I'll bet he never jerks off...
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Why are we going here? I hate this place.
I didn't get it either.
What? Where?!
Give me all your money, bitch!
Where did you get that?
Where?
Anthony's II!
Just now... I went with Seymour.
That guy is totally amazing.
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
Which one?
He gives me a total boner!
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
...maybe we should be lesbos...
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
Go ahead...
No, really...
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
Don't you want nice stuff?
What happened to Seymour?
How repulsive!
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
What are you talking about? Who?
Just some people from work...
Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...
What? When did you see Josh?!
He came into work.
Nothing.
You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
So, whaddya think?
It's fine.
There.
What time?
Do you want anything?
Wow... finally.
What about me? Am I not even here?
We're not.
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...
Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?
Seymour does.
You still interested in that?
I thought it wasn't for sale.
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.
Tell me what?
Punk rock is over!
Oh, how "punk."
That tape sucked, by the way!
Go die, asshole!
Hi... what's your name?
You're late, asshole.
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
Hey, where are you going?
That's five hundred dollars.
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s?
How much is it?
A dollar seventy-five.
Yeah, sure, I guess...
Oops! I dropped it!
NO!!!
Good luck...
I'm totally serious!
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
I don't think so...
PLEASE? We have to!
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Shh!
Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?
What are you, a fry cook or something?
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
Hey, can I borrow this?
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
Really?
Wow!  What was that all about?
Uh... hello?
Hi, it's me...
Oh, hi...
Boo!
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
I... I don't think so.
Does that mean you don't like me?
No, of course not.
So, do you like me, Seymour?
In what way do you mean?
What are you doing here?
I had to see you.
Can you at least let me in?
What's the matter?
Uh... I think there's some root beer...
You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
So where would we go?
What do you want?
What do you want?
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
I will if you want to.
They're Seymour's.
Well, here's where the fun never stops!
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
I agree.
Yeah.
I am.
What do we have here, Margaret?
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
She's not at home?
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
Why would she be hiding from me?
I don't know... where is she, then?
Maybe she's with Josh?
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
I don't know.
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
What do you mean?
On that pathetic fake blind date.
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
Seymour?
You were contracted to work-
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
Let me see the sick.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
Morning, friend, glorious day.
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
I am a man of peace.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
Don't they, though?
Yes he is.
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
Understand, I had help-
You're certain about tomorrow?  But you don't seem excited. 
You don't enjoy killing, do you? 
You never had it.
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
Very good indeed.
I don't suppose I could watch.
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
John, it will not be easy.
But you said they were always old.
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
What did I do?
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
I can try.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
...misfire... it jammed...
Think about something else.
Have you ever failed?
What happened to them?
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.
You think they'll come then?  Why?
Good luck.
How many do you think they've killed?
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.
It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.
Did it look like this in your mind?
I am also liaison between these two.
What are they looking at?
Oh yes, I think so. 
For you.
Thank you, Samuel.
I expect so- it's from my wife.
Do you love her?
I do, actually; very much.
You like him, don't you?
Oh yes. But it takes time.
You've known him long?
He has children?
Where is it?
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
How many cattle?
Four should do it.
Where do you go next?
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
Oh no.
Do you ever see him?
Occasionally
Does he ever mention me?
I won't.
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
No, you didn't, Frank.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
His name is Oscar.
Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
I'll do it.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
Good luck.
So this is what you do, huh?
Oh, hello, Peter.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
That's not true.  It was 1620.
That's a terrible thing to say.
Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming.
According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
I know.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
Yes, the scourge --
-- the sorrow --
I command you.
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
These boys aren't playing around.
Can I have some of your water?
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
Yes, I did.  We were city champs.
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
Egon!
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
I'd like to have a stool specimen
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
That's a thousand million electron volts.
You were supposed to help me with this.
That's it?  "I'll be back?"
Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
From where -- Neptune?
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
Nothing.  Not a trace.
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
Is the line sinking?
Rivers of the stuff!
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
Oh, hiya, Pete.
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
Who?
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Who, Ray?
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
I'm Ray --
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
And now you're going to eat it?
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
My Fault!
I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
Ready?
I'm ready.
Now that's one ugly dude.
Huh?  What?
You finished here?
Are you telling me how to drive?
No, I just thought --
Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
Tell him about the toaster.
It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
And pure --
How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
Aren't you glad we waited?
Roy?  Your clock broke.
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
Now where are you going?
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Uuuuuuugh!!
No.  They're just coming to me.
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Oh, Dana, it's you ...
... I thought it was the drug store.
Oh, Dana, it's you.
Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
Are you the Gatekeeper?
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
Is that your professional opinion?
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
That's a violin concerto.
You really don't act like a scientist.
No?  What do I act like?
Like a used car salesman.
What?
Uh-huh.
Well, let's check it out.
You're quite a housekeeper.
I told you, I ...
Damn!
Are you all right?
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
All right.  What do you want to do?
I think I should spend the night here.
That's it.  Get out.
On a purely scientific basis.
Out!
I want to help you.
I'll scream.
All right.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
Goodbye.
Great rehearsal.
You heard it?
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
What's that got to do with it?
Did you see it?  What was it?
Oh, that's very - unusual.
I think it's the food of the future.
Die in what sense?
I want you to have this. 
I don't believe in luck.
Great!  How's it going?
Are you Peter Venkman?
Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
And may I see this storage facility?
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
Because you didn't say the magic word.
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
May I please see the storage facility?
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
All right.  What is it?
A square?
Circle?
Nervous?
Yes.  I don't like this.
Two wavy lines?
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Were you recently in the bathroom?
Oh!  You're here.
What?
Don't cross the beams.
Why not?
Trust me.  It will be bad.
It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
Where's the Keymaster?
Who?
Gozer.
What now?
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
Life is just a state of mind.
Sorry, Buddy!
Set entry grid.
What do you mean by "seen?"
I told you it's real.
I don't know.  Talk to it.
For what purpose?
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
But most people are afraid to even report these things.
Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?
How was your date?
So do I.
Ray -- Something's here.
Where are you, Pete?
Third floor.  Get down here,
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
How do you know?
Who was the architect?
I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
What?  What popped in there?
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Mmmhmmm.
Me, too.
Do you believe in God?
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
And the seas would boil ...
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
Judgement Day ...
Stantz?  You okay in there?
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
That's what you told me two days ago!
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
More wine, sister?  Surely you can drink more than that.
If I may be so bold...
For the gods, spit it out!
Tribuus... tomorrow.
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
I am their hero!
Not yet, dear brother...
That's difficult to say, general.
I back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you, I'm not a politician...
They won't break this one.
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
I'm serious.
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
Marcus Aurelius has died.
Where is my father?
Why isn't he dead?  Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!
Yes, Caesar?
I've read of it.
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
Why you?
Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed?
No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
He killed his father and then my family...
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
The Senators admire you.
Tomorrow?
As soon as I can.
My troops don't make policy.
You brought the army into Rome.
He's very realistic.
What about their philosophy lessons?
They're studying with Cynics.
You need to come home!
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
Let him trust Quintus.
Take your hands off me animal!
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
You get to come alive again in the country!
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
How much money is involved?
Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
Before they leave, get gold.
I want nothing to do with the arena.
Hello.
Do you want some dinner?
Aren't you eating?
No.
No -- why should I?
Could you do it?
I'm sorry I took you in there.
But, Elaine --
Where is the car?
I want to go home.
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
But could you try?
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
We won't. Let's go inside.
Wait a minute.
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Do you?
Was she married or something?
Yes.
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
Did they ever find out?
No.
Yes.
I do.
You do?
Benjamin -- what's happening?
Why aren't you ready?
What is it?
That woman --
What?
That woman. The older woman.
You mean the one who --
Elaine --
No -- don't cry --
GET OUT!
Don't cry. 
I'm meeting someone.
Where are you meeting this person?
Is that him over there?
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
Here? In Berkeley?
Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
-- really incredible --
Here he comes.
Because -- I am.
Is it because I'm here?
What do you think?
I said I think it is.
All right then! Yes!
Well, I want you to leave.
What?
What did she say?
Why?
Because it isn't true.
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
What are you looking for?
My belt.
Are you going home?
No.
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
But Elaine --
What?
I don't know.
But you might.
Yes.
When?
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
I don't see how we can.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
I'll think about it.
You really will?
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
I just don't think it would work.
Why wouldn't it?
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
Why do you have to see him?
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
Oh no. He said that.
Shhhh.
Are we getting married tomorrow?
No.
The day after tomorrow?
Benjamin?
657-2036
Hello -- who is this?
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Thank you.
Ben!
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
Ben.
Yes, sir.
Are you listening?
Yes I am.
Yes, I will.
You a student?
What's that?
I said -- not exactly -- no.
What are you then?
What?
One of those outside agitators.
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
Who screamed?
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
Mr. McCleery?
You heard me. Out of here.
What for?
I am going to call the police now.
BENJAMIN?
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
Mrs. Robinson?
I'm in the bathroom.
Could you bring it up?
I'm putting it here by the door.
Will you bring it in to me?
Where are you?
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
Give me an hour.
Can I help you, sir!
What?
The Singleman party, sir?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
It's in the main ballroom.
A single room or a double room?
A single. Just for myself, please.
Is anything wrong, sir?
What? No. Nothing.
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Where is it?
What?
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
Oh no.
Is it a girl?
Is what a girl?
Whatever it is you're upset about.
In general.
What?
Will you take me home?
No. 
Thank you.
Will you come in, please?
Drink?
What do you think of me?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
What?
Did you know that?
Look -- I think I should be going --
No.
Oh my God.
Like what?
What do you think?
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
What is wrong with me?
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
Her portrait?
Yes.
Benjamin?
Yes?
I think I'll go to bed.
Oh. Well, goodnight.
Won't you unzip my dress?
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
I know that. But I'm --
What are you so scared of?
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
But they would! Don't you see?
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
Where is it?
Don't be nervous.
Get away from that door.
I want to say something first.
Let me out!
Do you understand what I said?
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
Yes, I do.
Benjamin?
Hello, Benjamin.
May I sit down?
May I have a drink?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
I haven't. No.
Do you want me to get it?
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Now?
Yes.
Well -- I don't know.
I got a single room.
Well -- do you want to go up first?
Yes -- I think that would be good.
I'll be up in five minutes.
Benjamin.
To tell you?
The number.
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
Well.
Benjamin.
Why don't you watch?
What?
Oh -- yes. Wood?
Wood or wire? They have both.
Either one will be fine.
Thank you.
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
You what?
This is all terribly wrong.
Benjamin, is this your first time?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
You can admit that, can't you?
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
Wait a minute!
On your first time --
Who said it was my first time?
Well what do you want to talk about?
Oh my God.
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Oh.
Neither.
You're not interested in art?
Can I take off my clothes now?
Do you really want me to?
Yes I do.
What one.
What?
What novel did you read.
There!
There isn't any.
What do you say to him?
He's asleep.
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
Calm down, Benjamin.
Now let's keep going here.
Right.
About five years.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
How many times a year.
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
Man, is this interesting.
But you don't hate him.
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
No.
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
See if you can guess.
Well I can't.
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Yes.
At college.
Yes.
What was your major?
Art.
Well how did it happen?
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
I'm curious.
We'd go to his car.
Oh no. In the car you did it?
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
Don't talk about Elaine.
Don't talk about Elaine?
No.
Why not?
I wish you'd tell me.
Good.
I was just kidding around.
Good.
But why shouldn't I?
I have my reasons.
Then let's hear them.
I wouldn't know.
Well, I'm not.
Are you?
Now don't start this.
What?
Did I say that?
You wouldn't.
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
If that's how you feel --
May I stay then?
Then give me your word you won't.
This is absurd.
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
Mrs. Robinson --
I don't believe you.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
I'll find her.
I say I've got it.
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Very good, sir.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
Braddock -- Braddock?
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
I drive around.
What else?
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
Not if you don't want to.
Goodnight, Benjamin.
You believe me, don't you?
No.
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
They don't know?
No -- they don't.
Well -- when did you decide all this?
I'm just --
-- worried?
About what?
I guess -- about my future.
To be what?
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
Say that again.
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
No. She doesn't know about it.
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
Oh no.
What?
Thank you very much, sir.
Ben -- how old are you now?
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
You'll never be young again.
Quite a while.
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
But why?
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
You miss the point.
Hello.
Mrs. Robinson?
Yes?
It's Benjamin.
Yes?
Benjamin Braddock.
Can you see me now?
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
The Carlsons' are here.
They came all the way from Tarzana.
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
I don't believe it.
I want to speak --
Not now.
Need any help?
No --
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
No -- no -- no -- no...
I don't like your tone.
With the pearls?
I've quit.
What about the money?
I'll pay you back.
I have an idea working in my head... 
Like dancing?
Never?
You're a fool!
He must be very nice.
Who?
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
You?
Oh -- work!!
Oh!
Reducing?
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Aren't you?
What?
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
Where downstairs?
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
You're very funny --
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Of course.
I'd given you up.
Chasing around.
Chasing what?
You were very different yesterday.
That was lovely.
Will you do me a big favor?
I'll do anything for you.
Would you like to make a man happy?
Yes -- I'd love to.
Why?
I feel sorry for him.
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
You live here?
For tonight. 
Oh!
Yes -- oh!
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
Please do not be frightened, Madam.
What do you want here?
Nothing -- only to be here.
Why do you hide in my room?
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Why do you look at me like that?
How tired you are!
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
Strange man...
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
What can you see?
You are beautiful!
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
There.
I don't want them now.
I'll not denounce you.
I know.
Do you understand?
Grusinskaya --
You do believe that I really love you?
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
I'll go -- good-bye.
Shall I see you again?
Suzette will be back here any minute.
When are you leaving Berlin?
Oh -- yes but -- later.
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
I can't.
Why do you think --
I'm worried about you.
Don't.
On the train?
Thank you, sir.
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
The Baron is tired?
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
If I could get into a game I might win some.
If we could scare up some men to play.
Ready, Kringelein?
Is that too much, Baron?
No -- not at all.
All right then.
That was my last.
You've lost everything?
I've no luck.
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
Well -- last night was not so good.
I thought she was splendid!
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
I think it would be much better if you went away.
Hello! Hello! --
Is that for me?
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
For me?
The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
Good heavens. What for?
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
Any letters?
No, Doctor.
Telegrams?
No, Doctor.
Anyone asked for me?
Send his bags up to my room.
Oh -- but -- I --
You're tired. I can see that.
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun.  Oh, the pain.
Oh, I've got to find it.
Oh, don't go.
I'm engaged for the evening.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
No - absinthe.
You like music?
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
A man might what?
Dance then? 
Yes.
You're trembling.
I never danced before -- in public.
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
Money!
Yes, of course, -- money!
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
Oh yes, of course.
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
What...! --
I'm the stenographer.
Moreover --
Moreover...
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
No -- only occasional jobs. 
Tired?
You pay me.
You're a very unusual stenographer --
Moreover...
What is this?
You...
What?
What brown hands you have.
That's from skiing.
Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
Not too quickly.
What?
You're a little too fast.
Can't you understand me?
I understand you perfectly.
Have you got it now?
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
Miss Flaemm.
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
Tomorrow morning.
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
Well -- you want me?
Yes.
Of course -- of course. 
Oh, yes.
Insolent young cub!
Baron!
You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.
You're sweet.
Come here. 
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
What we want to know about is Manchester.
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
No water -- What a place!
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
I know you did -- I said you did --
Sorry, Preysing. 
You've decided against the merger?
Yes --
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
Shall I tell them again?
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
You see -- what we are interested in --
I can't dance tonight --
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
Let us cancel the engagement.
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
Good morning, Suzette.
Madam has slept well?
Madam will dress now, it is late.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
I'm cancelling the engagement.
Why not?
Take them back, Suzette.
Hurry, Suzette.
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
It is time for the performance.
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
What -- what is it? Last night...
Last night?... There was no applause.
Good morning, Pimenov.
Gru -- you are positively radiant.
Again?
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
You're discharged.
Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
-- We must do something...
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
We will wait.
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
No news yet?
No. No word.
What's the matter with you?
What's bluff?
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
Bobo, no, I --
Your what?
My son was in the hospital --
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
No.
You ever hear about the oranges?
You mean, the insurance frammis?
Permanent damage.
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon!
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
All right.
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
Whadaya say?
Kaggs. Home office.
Well, uh... No.
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
Oh, come on, Roy.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
So what's your story today?
They twisted my arm.
They knocked out my tooth!
Thanks, uh, Lilly.
Don't mention it.
I guess I owe you my life.
Not as tough as you, huh?
I tripped over a chair.
Get off the grift, Roy.
Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
I pay my debts.
Expecting visitors?
I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
Going somewhere?
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
I just came back from Phoenix.
I've really got to --
Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
You must have some money.
Just a few bucks.
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
You want a drink?
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
You're getting off the grift?
Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
This time...
I didn't teach you that.
Scram. Go home.
I can't. I just left home.
You're too young. You should be in school.
Where's the five?
Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
Are you sure?
Roy?
Mm?
Look at me.
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
Roy? It this all we have?
All? It ain't bad.
What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
Get well soon.
Every day in every way.
Big spender.
No.
Working the what?
I'm a salesman.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
The long end. Big con.
What happened to Cole?
He retired.
Where?
Upstate.
Upstate where?
Think about it. Okay?
Yeah?
Open your door.
What?  What for?
You were gone for a while.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
I saw her.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
But the setup's there. It's there now.
Don't I get any say in this?
No! Because I --
That's what I say.
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
What is it? What's going on?
I'm happy the way I am.
Roy Dillon?
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
Not that it matters.  This is the morgue?
You up to it now?
Yes, I know, I know.
Oh, Jesus.
No question, huh?
Well, thank you. And thank them.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
Well, when you put it that way.
Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
One set of muddy shoe prints.
Where?
You take all your dates here. Blake?
I can be real stiff.
That's it?
Care to join me?
Yes.
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
I'll be damned.
Mind if we sit down?
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
A dead body?
It's Amy Kramer.
Besides, it's historically inaccurate.
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
Another historical inaccuracy.
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
No shit?!
Jimmy, what are you doing?
Checking out your place.
No.  Wait for the police.
What the --
You're twisted.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
Oh, so now it's my fault?
No.
Why didn't you tell me?
Where are you going?
He found you, didn't he?
Get on the bus.
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Just get on the bus.
I'm not leaving without her.
John, you can't help her now.
What?  Where is she?
Oh, God... no... not Molly.
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Where'd you get it?
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
You stole it?
Not me.
Why not?
What are you doing here?!
I came to see you.
I can see that.  Why?
Can I come in?
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
Then you come out here.
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
You look kind of cold.
I'm okay.
Better?
Linda!  He killed Linda!
Who?!
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
Looks great.  It does.
You okay?  You seem a little off.
It's John, isn't it?
It's always John.
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
This kid just wants his freedom.
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?
Hey, you alright?
What?
What are you looking at?
Who?
Michael Meyers.
The serial killer?
No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  It's the truth.
I can't believe this is happening.
We've got to get these kids out of here...
Look, they're staring right at us.
What is it?
I have to pee.
Can't you hold it?
You aced it, didn't you?
Better her than me.
Shane's going as a condom.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Thanks!
Let the party begin.
Have enough fun for the both of us.
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
Mom -- Who is this?
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
Is Tim there?
Whatever happened to women in back?
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
What if your parents come home?
Aren't you gonna answer that?
Answer what?
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
You've been watching too much TV.
He says things.  Bad things.
No, Mom -- keep it on!
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
Promise?
Mommy!!!
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
Who are you?
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
My, God!  What have you done to him?
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
God, what's wrong with him?
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
Where's the baby?!
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
What now?!
Come on!
But surely Rogers isn't --
It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
What is that?
There you are.  Who was that boy?
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
It was you.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Stay away, Sam.
Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
Miss me, baby?
I dunno, boy.
Hm?
It's a bitch.
A bitch.
Didn't recognize you.
I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
Home is important to a man.
You know what gets me?
I suppose.
Home.
You know what gets me?
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
At least we found the diamonds.
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
You know what gets me?
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
What'll you do for transportation?
Go home.
So long, Colonel.
You know what gets me?
Let's talk about it some other time.
How short the skirts are.
Go home!
And how were things?
Otherwise, how are things?
Could have happened to anybody.
First Nagasaki--now this.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
What's funny about that?
How do you know that?
You told me.
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
I didn't know we had any women left.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
In what way, pray tell?
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
You never played a violin.
Me?
You.
Okay.  Okay.
You're an imbecile.
I know you think that.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
Hello.
Is Penelope in?
The posies are for her?
I wanted to apologize.
You've come to the right man.
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
I forget mine for years on end.
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
Insurance!
What an awful sound!
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
Fifty years?
You're making a joke.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
We got to get another pilot.
For what?
You invited me.
To make an ass of yourself.
I wouldn't drop my gun.
You're hollow, like a woman.
Anybody home?
As a matter of fact--
Hello.
You were about to ask a question?
Are you--do you--
Do you know who Wanda June is?
Life has denied me that thrill.
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
Everybody says he was so brave.
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
She met him at college.
Excellent!
What's good about that?
"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
England?
Oh hell.
I don't know.
Mhravitch.  Remember that name.
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Why don't you go to bed--son.
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
Damn.
A hundred dollars!
The smallest thing I've got.
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
Dad?
What's this?
Nothing.
That's a rifle you have?
No.
Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?
I'm talking to you gently now.
"Hamburger Heaven."
Can I help you, sir?
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
Eighteen--  and a half.
I'm engaged.
Daughter--I love you very much.
You don't even know me.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
What's the matter?
Give us time.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
Disease?
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
What's that all about?
We thought a doctor might help.
Your old beau?
We thought it was an emergency.
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
We all are.
Shouldn't you lie down?
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
Nothing would please me more.
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Say hello to your mother.
Now that's what I call fun.
He hasn't had breakfast yet.
Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
It's so--so stark.
You used to like it stark!
Now--turn around, if you would.
I have some change!
Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
They don't have to feel like slaves.
No.
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
The doctor.
And what is his most cherished possession?
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
And no one's there now?
No you're not!
I came for my clothes.
I came for Paul as well.
If he wants to go.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
It's a big and busy funeral home.
Well--what have we here?  A family.
Almost a Christmas scene.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
You're begging him to kill you?
I plan to live one hundred years!
No.
I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
Help your mother find the bullet.
How do I load?
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
Ooops.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
Gentlemen--that's nice.
It's always locked.
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.
Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
She's fine.  Please--
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
Will you please go?  An emergency!
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
Are--are you crying, Penelope?
Ah!  You're ambulatory!
I was going to ask.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
I thought she was a widow.
It died for your sins.
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
This is man to man.
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
You're old--so old.
Hands and knees, you say?
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
I'm an honorable clown?
King Arthur.
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
Cut me open.  Find out.
I've struck my blow.
Don Quixote.
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
The new hero is you.
Here.  Finish the job.
More clowning!  Don't you see?
If you want to be found that way.
Don't shoot.
No.  No.
Get up.
Can't do it.
Thank you--for my life.
What are you going to do?
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
You don't know?
It was a bitch.
Alice got married again.
She did?
You didn't even find that out?
Dead!
Jesus.
Alice is dead?
So long, you guys.
Thought you were another wife, maybe.
Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?
I heard you were looking for me.
Because he was cruel?
I don't care what she wears.
Something's made you sore.
You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
What's this?
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
Thank God!
That goes double for me.
And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared.
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
Stay home tonight!
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
He's a ghost!
Thank you, kind sir.
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
That's an interesting piece of news.
Not true.
How did she lose her feet?
In a railroad accident many years ago.
I didn't know that.
A lot of people don't.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
I hate that thing.
Yes, he is.
Is Norbert still here?
No.
Then who flushed the toilet?
Father's friend.
What's his name?
Don't know.
Mom?
That man is your father.
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
I don't get it.
That's why I'm crying.
What does he say to do?
Yeah.
Then get him.
Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
You're taking Mom out tonight?
Don't worry about it.
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
I hate that thing.
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
He isn't any friend of Father.
He isn't?
He is my father.
He'd assume we had.
Yes?
Did you see him?
Yeah.
Far as I know.
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
How long has this been going on?
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
I'm sorry.
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
That's the XKE.
I wish Paul luck.
They didn't murder me.
It's a jungle out there.
You know each other?
We met here earlier this evening.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Get out of here.
Do it!
Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.
Not true.
Kid--kid--
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
You're not exactly the type we're looking for.
You mean I'm black?
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
Do you want to take a session?
I just want to ask some questions.
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
You're still dressed?
Well, I want to...
Pull out your cock.
Are you going to stiff me?
Now, what do you want?
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
Hello. You want some information?
Yeah.
We offer...
Yeah, yeah...
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
I don't know no Tod.
My name is Hope. This is Faith.  Charity's in back.
That's all you got, three girls?
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
No, that would be much too overpowering.
Are you sure it's all right?
Yes. I think it'll look better.
Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?
Are you the star of this picture?
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
The other girl is the star?
She thinks so.  What do you do?
Yeah.
You making a feature?
No. I saw her with Tod.
Where is she?
Tod might know.
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
You're not a film producer, are you?
Are you a private detective?
Something like that. How much do you make?
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
Up front?
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
No.
You don't drink?
A friend.
Of Joanne's?
Yeah.  I'm her father.
And your wife? Where's she?
At least I'm a growing person.
What rate?
Say what?
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
No.
Neither am I.
But it's all you do.
What do you care about?
What's T-J?
Tijuana.
They were here?
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
What does that mean?  What does he do?
He deals in pain.
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
You really believe all that?
Yeah.  Well, mostly.
It's not quite the same thing.
Rot in hell, honey.  He's busy now.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
What makes you so sure?
Why do you say that?
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
What happened?
Where is he?
But then you'll forget about me.
Well, what do they know?
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
So then, Mr. Mast...
Who's paying you?
You are.
Hello?
Mr. Van Dorn?
Where are you? The connection sounds very good.
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
I've got a meeting...
What are you paying me for?
Where is she?
I don't know.
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
That's like a stag film.
No.
They're legal now.
Where is she?
I don't know.
I don't know.
The police? They know less than you do.
Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.
I'm only human, you know.
Get out.
Like what?
Where'd you hear that name?
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
What happened, pilgrim?
Just leave me alone.
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
What is it, Jake?
How's your business, Jake?
Jake?
Wes, do me a favor.
Just do what I say. Don't ask.
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
That's not true, Mr...?
Where is she? Where is the girl?
Where does he hang out?
I don't know.
No.
What you got in mind?
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
Who told you about this?
Is this with a girl named Kristen?
Well...
Take it or leave it.
You wait here. I'll find out where she is.
Where's Ratan?
Fifty cents admission.
Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?'
It's a short film.
This is from the movie I was talking about.
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.
But I...
Here. Take your fifty cents back.
No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
Sounds all right.
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
He asked me. You going with anybody?
I don't know.
You ever play Chicken?
What's that?
You never heard of that?
Com'on, tell me.
Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.
I'm worried about Jake.
To his own daughter?
You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
Granville's looking for you anyway.
The guy who bought you that ring.
You can fuck off, too.
You're taking a big chance.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
Was he with a girl?
No.
You are at the University, Candy?
Yes, I am.
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
Yes.
Oh, I don't have one.
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
Isn't this your vehicle?
No, no. I just took it.
Okay, lady. Out.
Haven't we met before?
None of that, lady.
No.
Possession of a stolen shovel.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
Then whose name is it registered in?
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Wait here.
Because if you are...
And what do you do, my dear?
How interesting.
Edith was just telling me about her job.
I'm a file clerk.
What do you want?
A block of ice.
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
Eh, no. Thank you.
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
Do you dance?
What?
Do you sing and dance?
Eh, no.
But this is my car.
Your hearse?
It's very interesting.
No.
Oh, at the dentist's?
All right.
My door is always open.
All right.
Harold?
How about some ginger pie?
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
Me! No. Of course not.
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
What do you think?
Why do you say that?
Because they are all the same.
What happened?
Look.
What?
Over there by the courthouse.
But what?
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
But this is public property.
Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
Oh, my. We're too late.
We'll come back in the morning.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
No.
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
Okay?
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
I <u>think</u> I see it.
The ice is melting.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
Well, I really don't smoke.
Of course.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
Maude, do you pray?
Pray? No.  I communicate. 
Well, why don't you?
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
From the guys who got the matches, of course. 
Maude, I must speak to you.
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
But they have.
But they'll put me in jail.
Don't you advance on me.
That wasn't very scary.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
How about some candy floss?
You sure have a way with people.
Look at the stars.
- end where I began.
Maude.
Yes.
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
I took them out.
It looks like you. Thanks.
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
Supper for two.
It's all right. It's organic.
Oh, Harold. 
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
It's true. I can't live without you.
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
To whom?
What?
How do you do?
Would you like a cigarette?
Do you play?
Oh, is this your father?
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Like a tea ceremony?
Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
Just give me a rough estimate.
Fifteen.
Does that worry you?
Yes. It does.
Ah, yes.
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
You mean when I'm not working on a...
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
No.
None at all?
You liked your teachers?
Yes.
Yes.
Your studies?
Then why did you leave?
No.  I'd have liked to.
I'd have liked to talk to him.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
The moment of truth.
Yes.
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
Oh sure.
How about to slit his throat?
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Parasite!
Stay where you are, Harold .
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it.
It's different for us.
We've always been here.
Julia.
Frank.
I knew you'd come.
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
Yes!
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
He... he loved me.
Yes... Yes. You look...
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
It's a beautiful dress...
She's done it.
She certainly has.
It's coming.
I knew you'd come back.
So... You're Kirsty, huh?
I... I had a visitor.
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
The box. I need the box.
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
What do you mean?
The boxes! I TOLD you.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
O.K. Let's go.
What are you talking...
I've got to finish it.
Well... G'bye.
But I didn't open it! I didn't!
Then why are you here?
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
I... remember.
He talked about Demons, huh?
Who?
Don't get psychic with me.
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
You were burned by some organic acid.
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
Remind me why I keep doing this.
hound of resurrection --
See? I don't like that --
harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
I abhor violence.  Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
It's almost over!!
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
What the hell was that? An ape?
It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
I thought you liked being on TV.
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
Son. About Rasputin --
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
I worry about you.
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
Don't look! Turn around.
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
It's her choice --  She's human --
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Who's the squirt?
Well, you did break out --
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?
She's dead.
I knew those men better than you did --
No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
Those things never work. Never.
Each of us gets a belt.
-- should go back. Now!
No. Don't --
Thank you.
Whatcha looking at, John??
Helping you -- I just --
Myers??? How's your arm?
I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
Myers?
Yes?
What took you so long?
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
No. I never was.
You want me to hold him down?
Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out --
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
Where do you --
"Need" is a good, solid word.
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Hey, your chili's getting cold --
Anything else you --
Not from you.
Well good n-
Alone?
You better have that looked at.
Goodnight, then.
You're going alone?
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
I like that...
Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name --
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
Cocky.
Strong.
He -- loves you.
I know.
It's freezing, isn't it?
Hit me.
Hello, I'm --
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Yes, I --
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Pardon?
Christ!
What's the problem?
It's my lucky day.
Hi.
Want to buy a bed?
What's happening?
We're leaving.
Alright, let's give it another try.
Oh.
Julia's my second wife.
The box... you opened it. We came.
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
Let me alone, will you?
No time for argument.
You did this before, right?
Many times.
Nobody escapes us.
Just in time.
We've got such sights to show you --
Please. Get back into bed.
I have to speak to my father.
Julia!
No.
You remember.
No.
One last time. Give me the box.
Come to Daddy.
This isn't happening.
You bastard --
You're Julia, right?
That's right. Who are you?
I'm brother Frank.
Oh.
There is going to BE a wedding?
Oh.  Oh yes.
I don't want to see the dress.
But you said --
What about Larry --
I'm very happy.
Oh my God.
Don't look at me.
Who are you?
Help me.
Tell me who you are.
No. God no.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
I'm hurting
Good.
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
Later.
Not know.
A long time.
This is what began it.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
You're still afraid.
You can't love him.
I don't.
So where's the harm?
She'll tell them everything...
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
Maybe.
There's very little I can do about it.
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Well we can't just stay here --
Kirsty.
Which is where?
Kirsty? It's very late.
Where's Daddy?
What's the problem?
You look terrible. Have you had an accident?
This afternoon.
No, damn you --
We're going to freeze to death.
Maybe somebody changed the lock.
Like who?
Just a thought --
It smells damp.
How long since you were here?
Not exactly modern.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
All right.
So what's the argument?
No argument.
Where are you?
Why not?
How are you doing through there?
What have you done?
You're NOT going to faint.
Shit.
It's probably going to need stitches.
I'm going to throw up.
Take it slowly.
So damn stupid.
You're done worse.
I'll be scarred for life.
Julia?
I'm here.
Are you all right?
Just feeling a bit sick.
Can I get you anything?
Maybe a brandy.
I'll be down in a minute
Who was it?
Are you all right?
Fine.
-- I'll go see.
Larry...
Oh baby.
Don't go upstairs.
Huh?
Please...
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong?
I don't know where to begin...
What are you talking about?
Not much fun, is it?
What?
Drinking alone.
Not much.
What are you drinking?
Just soda.
Plain soda?
That depends.
There's a first time for everything.
Well, isn't it?
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
Do you care ?
No, not much.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
No personal details?
This isn't the bedroom.
What's going on?
I suppose not.
First time for everything.
You know, you're very beautiful.
You're awake. Good girl.
What happened to me?
I'll get the doctor.
Who brought me in here?
You wouldn't believe me.
Who's there?
Kirsty?
I got through.
Where are you?
I found a room.
What did you say?
No Dad.
You'd like the house.
YOU'D like my room.
Well I want you to see the house.
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
You will keep in touch.
O.K.
Take care, Dad.
Call me tomorrow.
Big house.
You like?
Surprise.
Are you O.K.?
I've forgotten.
Never better. You sleep well.
Yeah.
I love you, honey.
...maybe we should never have come back.
I have to talk to you.
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
Finished?
He's gone.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
I don't believe it.
I'm afraid it's true.
I want to see.
No you don't.
Yes!
Get the fuck out of here.
What's the problem?
PLEASE. You're in danger.
We're on the Cointreau.
I won't be able to stand.
You're not going?
Need any help?
I'm here.
I thought we'd lost you.
It's late.
Please. I want to see you home. All right?
All right.  No. That's nice.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
I see.
She's so damn... English.
I beg your pardon?
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
Oh no?
Oh no.
Oh!
Are you alright ?
Your father told me you were working here.
If I make it through the day.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
Are you busy after work ?
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
Steve. Thank God you came.
What's wrong?
Don't let them take me, Steve --
What did I say?
'Bye.
Do I know you?
Alison's.
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
What's next?
Play it.
Say it.
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
We'll do it next Monday.
Not the point.
What did he ever do to you?
He offended me with his terrible taste.
What?
What do you mean, "what?"
What are you snickering about?
I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Suck my ass.
Hey.
What the fuck is that?
My band.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
None.  Christ!
Laura.  Her dad died.
Because it's in The Big Chill.
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
The little skate-fuckers.
No way.
What the fuck is that?
We're getting that anyway.
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
Sonic Death Monkey.
Great.  Can I have it then?
Well what about the new Echo --
I have a television.
Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
What?
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
He's got one!
On Clark Street!
A couple blocks!  About six!
We work there!
Don't do it, Rob!
"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.
Hey, Barry.
Oh, hi.
May I help you?
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Pardon me?
Your desert island top-five.
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
What do you mean, four more?
Fine.  That's great.
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Nice friend.
Yeah.
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Hey Charlie.
'Morning, Dick.
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
Great.
I'll tape it for you.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
I always hated this song.
Let's not.
Rob --!
Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
Can I do anything?
What is this.
It's Vince and Justin.
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
You look upset.
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Maybe I should talk to him.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Can I help you?
I dunno.
I dunno.
You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
Shit!
Hi.
What were the others?
Just the obvious stuff.
What's the obvious stuff?
What?
Did you say something?
No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
Fine.  One.
It sounds stupid.
Nevermind.
You won't like it.
Just ask it!
Is it better?
Is what better?  Better than what?
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
Never?
I haven't felt like it.
We'll talk some other time.
So, how are you?
Have you slept with him yet?
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
Hello.
Are you still in love with me?
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
I'm sure.
You know I'm a good person.
Those aren't mine.
I guess I am.
Hello.
Are you alright?
Pig died.
Who the fuck's Pig?
No, no.  When are you going home?
Look, are you coming or not?
You're soaking.
Mmnn.
I don't want to go back.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
Let's go home.  Okay?
C'mon.  I want to know.
Want to know what, exactly?
What's the difference?
To make you feel better.
No, but...
More confident, maybe.
Hi.
Hi.  What are you doing?
Nothing.
Wanna go to dinner?
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
Are you worried about tomorrow night?
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
I mean it.
I know.
Would you marry me if I was?
No.  Probably not.
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
I don't know.
Very persuasive.
Fair enough.
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
Rob here.
Hey.  It's Liz.
It's a crematorium.
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
What difference does it make?
Enough, Liz.
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
So you live in Chicago now?
Hi, Marie.
It's a great song.
The Conformist.
You haven't even seen it!
Are you okay?
So you'll stay?
Yeah.
Which way are you going?
That way.  You?
I'll call you.
Hi, Mom.
Everything all right?
Great.  Super-fantastic.
How's the store?
She left.  She's gone.
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
I knew this was going to happen.
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
What do you think?
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
These are worth at least, I don't know --
But you must have --
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
Sixty.
Seventy-five.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
Naw.  Those are for us.
I think you have more.
I'm Vince.
How old is Richard?
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
I warned you.
Doesn't have a head, does he?
Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
You're the expert.
You're very macabre.
It's my birthday.
Happy birthday.
Would you like more tea?
He was unsual.
Would you remember his name?
-Okay okay.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
Do you play?
Yes.
Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
Byzantine?
Good reflexes.
Grave robbers?
Probably.
People like that rarely leave business cards.
You have an active imagination.
Why not?
Where?
Who is he?
At the moment?  Carl Smith.
He called you "MacLeod".
That bothers you?
What about me?
I'd rather hear yours.
He sees me as a threat.
No one knows you're here?
No.  I had to talk to you.
You had to do _nothing_!
You're wrong.
You're a fool.
You did kill those men.
Not all of them.
Yes.
It's some sort of party the town is throwing.
Maybe it would do us both good.
It's beautiful.
At least.
A factor of age.
I see.
I'm not even sure why.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
Who are you?
That would be difficult to explain.
Yes.
He knows about you.
Of bodies.
I didn't kill the watchman.
You killed those other two.
Not the same.
What about that family in '31?
There are differences.
You kill with your left hand?
I haven't killed _you_.
Don't.
Come here, Brenna.
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
What is it you want?
Get out.
The inheritance.
Forget it.
I'm calling an attorney.
You and I should talk first.
Four?
All fashionably without heads.
You're an asshole, Moran.
What's all of this got to do with me?
What were you doing in Felton?
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
Corey, you _owe_ me.
It's that important?
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
I don't believe him.
Requiem acer'nam donaei-
What are you doing man?
Be quiet.
Stop.
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Afternoon.
Your name is Conor?
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
Your marks would suggest great injury.
You know me home.  Me name.
It is less.
You feel you know me.
I don't know why.
I don't understand.
You are still so very young.
I'm twenty-two.
What?
It is as you are.
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
This is madness!
It is the truth.
This can't be.
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
Then they were right.  I am evil. This is God's punishment.
You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.
Me arm hurts.
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
Impotent cow.
It will take less effort as you learn.
You have a gift.  One you must protect.
What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.
I'm your future husband, remember?
My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
Some think not.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
Something pretty.
Who am I deceiving?
Tradition.
Romirez understood.  Not you.
Finish your prayers?
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
Your name?
I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
What is your position?
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
Wait.  I think we understand each other.
It can be different.  It must be.
We must talk.
Stay out of it.
Do not turn your back on me.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Ah, Conor, how you look a man.
Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
Where did you learn that?
My father taught me.
Your father must be smart.
Figure she's with him?
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
I don't know.
Smith.  Carl Smith.
How many came?
The last four.
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
How are you?
Head still secure to the neck.
And have you something to settle with me?
He found us even there.
I haven't drunk this much since-
I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.
I knew his great-grandfather.
Long time.
You've been here from the start.
Friend of yours?
Run!
Leave her out of this.
What's the point?
This isn't done.  Get up.
Tradition.
It's all we have.
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
Leave her alone.
We have some unfinished business.
Are you here?
I want you to come to me.
Yes laddie, I have her.
This your present address?
What were _you_ looking for?
That's none of your business.
Do you know what this is?
A mystery.
My condolences.
Where were you Tuesday night?
A neighbor saw your car leave.
Steven, Conor didn't die.
You're one of William's kids, huh?
We were very close.
The resemblance is amazing.
When may I expect the cleaners?
Morning Mr. North
Nothing to be sorry about.
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
I'm getting married tomorrow.
What's the idea of locking this?
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
Hello, Bensinger.
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
I'll keep you in mind.
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
What's the matter?
I lost my wallet.
Did you finish the interview?
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Hildy!
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Oh, she was here.
Where'd she go?
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
You're Bruce Baldwin?
Yes!
Mother? But your mother --
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.
Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office. 
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
You'll ask me to what?
You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
Call Duffy!
No, you don't!
What's this?
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
Save that for the Tribune.
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
What?!!
I have a lunch date. I just want --
You can break it, can't you?
No, I can't.
What do you mean by that?
Just what I said. That's what I --
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
You've had a better offer, eh?
What's the matter?
Sweeney.
You've got to help me, Hildy.
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
Where'd you meet this man?
Bermuda.
What's his line?
He's in the insurance business.
The insurance business?
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Say, could I meet him?
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
You're not afraid, are you?
Then what does he want with you?
Allow me.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
Never mind that. What's the story?
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?
Yes. Where is he?
She jumped out of the window.
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
Hildy!
How much do you want on it?
All the words you've got.
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
Hildy!
What tickets?
Railroad tickets.
I'm finished.
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
What did you do with her?
What happened?
Where is she? Tell me!
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
Hello -- hello...
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
Ring that number, will you?
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
No, you don't! Walter!
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
When did you deliver this first?
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
Don't tell me you were worried!
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
I don't know what to do, Walter.
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
Then why are you doing it?
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.
How about Bruce's?
But, Hildy -- I can explain --
Are you referring to me, Madam?
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
You stay here. I'll find out everything.
You know me. The shirt off my back.
You got plenty of money?
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
Walter!
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
He's on my phone. He just called me.
Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
There's money in it, Cooley.
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
You said it!
They're always after me for interviews.
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
I call. What you got?
Three bullets! Any good?
Who locked the door?
Open up there, will you!
Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
She looks as though she's going to come to.
Give me a hand with her, will you?
You guys wanna play some more poker?
Boy, did you see her go?
No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it.
What's the dope, Sheriff?
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
Hold the phone!
I'll call.
Goodbye, Yonson.
You ain't gettin' out o' here!
We know what you're up to.
How's everything, Gus?
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
Little rum in yours, too?
No -- just coffee, Gus.
Gus, this --
You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
Take your paws off me!
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
What?
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
After all I've done for you --
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
For who?
Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
Pete, I want to talk to you!
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
Pete, you're through!
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
Pure politics!
I did.  Hold the wire.
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
We'll fix that, too. 
What?
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
Who is this man?
That's a lie!!
Got you, Williams!
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
Five hundred dollars.
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
Phone for you, Hildy.
Who is it?
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
There goes another scrub lady.
You fight it cut.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
Did you get that, Hildy?
Look out, you --
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
Come on with that money!
First you got to sign a receipt. 
Here!
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
Kings and sixes.
Hiding him where?
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Isn't that her picture?
Don't forget about production for use.
You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
What good'll it do?
What's that?
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
What's the idea?
Hey --
What's from the Governor?
Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?
Who? Me?
The what?
The City Sealer's office!
You mean here in the city?
I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
No, I don't think so.
I'll explain it tomorrow!
Is it hard?
Get out of here!
They wouldn't take it.
Here's the picture of my wife.
Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.
Get the cops, somebody.
There she is!
What's your hurry?
Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
What's he want?
The door was locked.
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
That was a googly!
This is going too far, young man.
Give him the you-know-what.
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
Pauline's mum got killed.
I never was.
I know a secret.
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
You want to join our gang?
I don't mind.
Yes.
Sod.
Sod.
Bloody.
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
You wouldn't.
Would.
You couldn't.
Ask her yourself.
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
It's easy. I've done it.
Who with?
I did see them. I did.
Can't we just see the end?
They've got the real thing outside.
I'm starting my own collection.
Well, for the baby, really.
Crocodiles! Aah!
Boy, that was some air-raid.
Where?
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
You need trees for an avenue.
You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
So you're going to be a grandfather.
And I'm still just a lad myself.
Here's to music. And absent friends.
And absent bridegrooms!
Has Sue got it right?
You joined up.
And what's that?
We don't know anything about it
Well?
It looks....foreign.
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
When do you think you'll get leave again?
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
You know it? It must be an old one.
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
He always knows.
What is it, pet?
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
I don't believe this is happening to me.
It looks a bit fishy to me.
Now take deep breaths, and push.
No, Mother! It's War! War!
Up to six weeks, I think.
I can't do it. What's the point?
It seems to have survived.
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
I wish it could all have been different.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
You're having me on, Molly.
Am I? Maybe I am.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
What?
Cone.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
Tiny's home.
Ma, Tiny's in.
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
Drink up, it's party time.
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Who's your Daddy!
Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
Where's that?
What about the tree?
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
Christ, you scared the shit out of me.
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Is your brother ready to go?
He left!
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
Thank you.
A dead one.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
That's not something to joke about.
Hey, great they're back.
I'd like to see that.
Can I help you with something?
I was just wondering.
You know... a couple of queers.
What the hell are you laughing about?
Take that, you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore!
You shouldn't a done that.
Why? You gonna do something about it?
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
Great story Goober, how much?
Come on, bro. Let's go.
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
I don't drive cross country.
But if you did.
Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
How awesome?
Keep straight on this road here.
It's a hitchhiker.
She looks like she stinks.
What was that?
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
Well, technically I did what ya said.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
I like sleep.
Honk at him. Scare him.
Fuck! We are fucked!
What's he so excited about?
Just grin and bear it.
Don't look back, just get in the car.
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
Why are we stopping?
Go around him.
There's not enough room.
Fine. I'll go straight.
What!
Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
What are you doing!
I gotta open the gate.
Drive through it!
Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
Huh?
Aw, come on. It will be fun.
Ugh, what's that smell?
Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Really, now is not the time to make waves.
What are you laughing at?
We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
That was good babe, just keep doing that.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Sleeping.
A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
Don't even say it.
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
How long has it been?
What was that?
What? I didn't hear anything.
I don't hear anything.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
A couple hours!
What'd we here, Georgie?
Yeah, no mercy here.
Recover any bodies?
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
God damn.
You find something, Georgie?
What'd ya got there?
Huh?
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
What do they call you, sweety?
Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
I'll go. It's my fault.
Huh?
That stupid hillbilly slut.
This is way too fucked up for words.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
I um... no, I don't think so...
Get in... now!
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
We gotta break it open.
Tell it to my daughter.
Jesus Christ.
Mr. Willis?
Yes, sir.
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
I always favored the Hulk.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
Aw, fuck.
Plates match.
I guess not.
Wydell.
Over.
That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
Tell him, Harold.
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
Say my name.
You remind me so much of Nathan.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
French?
No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
Thank you so much for accompanying me.
Is everything fine?
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
What is wrong, my darling?
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
Hmmmph.
Not in front of the boy.
My little French.
Stop. Get away.
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
Yeah? What?
Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?
Well?
Please. I look a mess.
No. You look so beautiful.
I've moved on.
You were wonderful!
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
I want our boy back.
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
No.
It's okay, Puff.
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
Very well.
I want to be the way I was before.
Progress!
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
Shut up and tell me.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
Loves animals. Loves you.
My brother is discreet.
I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
One night stand?
No. I married a midget.
Oh?
Three foot one.
And I think I'm going to.
Lila, it's Rosie.
Please, honey, let me in.
Rose, please go away.
How'd you know where I was?
Nathan told my brother.
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
Done!
I'm going to miss you.
Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
You've got to respect that.
Boy, this is good!
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
You do?
Yes, and...
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
I like you, too, Nathan.
What are you doing in there?
I'll be out in a minute.
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
Shaving cream?
Yes, darling.
Oh, and the sun block?
What SPF, sweetie?
Yes.
Flares?
Did you see that?
What?
I don't know. Something.
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
What?
What are you doing in there?
Who is it?
Who from work?
You have to shave? Like an ape?
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
So, how's it going today?
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
Of course not.
I'm just preoccupied.
Do you like my new look?
Really?
That's great. It's a great color for you.
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
How's work?
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
Bravo to you, Puff!
I think he's ready.
You just have to control it. We're not apes.
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
So he's doing okay?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
Yahoo!
Extra dessert?
Puff, put the gun down.
So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
Wait!
Mother?
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
Boys just passing through?
Yep.
Pittsburgh?
Mm hmm.
About sixty, seventy bucks.
Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
Check!
I'm ready.
What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
That's right, Miss Packard.
And a fact is a fact.
Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.
You know what's good for him?
To win.
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
How?
Are you ready for another?
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
We'll be there.
Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
How much?
Oh, about five hundred.
How much do I owe you?
Hey, mister.
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
Okay?
Make it twenty.
Cut.
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
Thought you only drank milk.
Only when I work.
I lost twenty bucks.
What is?
Pool.
Character.
He drank as much whisky as you did.
Whaddya been so far?
Thanks for the drink.
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
Seventy-five per cent.
I never saw you do anything else.
Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money?
Now, when did you adopt me?
Hello, Eddie.
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Man named Turk Baker?
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
Sign up.
You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
What happened to you anyway?
I been thinking.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
Hey, Findley's here.
Where?
Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?
So does Eddie.
Well, we won't.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
Sure.
How do we stand?
'Bout even.
When do I raise the bet?
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
I can beat him.
How're the hands?
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
I wanna walk.
It's a long walk.
I got time, Bert.
Tell her what?
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
Well, here it's half.
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
Maybe. You want to play?
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
What's your game? What do you shoot?
Yeah, that's right.
He's my partner.
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
How do you feel?
Fast and loose, man.
In the gut, I mean.
Quit. He's too good.
Hey, how much are we ahead?
No, it isn't, Charlie.
The pool game is over when Fats says it's over.
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
Give me a drink, will ya?
You don't need a drink.
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Hello, Charlie...  C'mon in...  That's my girl.
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
I want you to come back on the road with me.
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
What for? To play Fats again?
Is that what you think?
Just like that?
No, no more for me.
Findley.
When?
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
That's right. When?
You gentlemen care for a drink?
There it is. I'm broke.
Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
Yeah. You must come again.
Hey, uh, mister? Hey, okay if I grab a cue?
Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
What's the limit?
Half and a dollar.
How much you playin' for?
A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
You quittin' too?
You're a pretty good player.
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
Try me.
Shoot.
Okay, friend. You're on.
Call it.
You quittin', friend?
Long wait for a bus?
How long you been waiting?
How long have you been waiting?
What time does the bus leave?
What bus?
Yours.
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
Have a nice trip?
Fair.
Can I sit down?
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Do you always ask so many questions?
You talk kind of funny, but I like it.
I used to be an actress.
You don't look like a college girl.
I'm not.
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
I drink.
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
No.
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
What time is it?
Why?
What did you say that for, Sarah?
You told me.
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
Where you been all day?
At school. It's Thursday.
What did all this stuff cost you?
When you've got money, you'll pay.
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Don't you ever cook anything?
Oh, cut my finger.
Eddie, what's in that case?
Haven't you opened it?
Do you want me to go?
Give it to me.
What's this supposed to mean?
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
Who is it?
You wanna drink?
Would he know?
He knows. A lot.
He's a gambler.
Well, what else does?
I love you.
You glad?
What is it, Eddie?
Nothin'.  Want another drink?
What do you want to tell me?
For how long?
Oh, I don't know.
A week? A year?
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
Leave now.
Oh, grow up.
Fifty-seven.
Why?
Well, what's the matter?
I hear you've been looking for me.
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
That's what the game's all about.
Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
You name it.
You lived like this once.
That is not now, human!
What about... now?
Yes.
When you're here, in the city, where do you live?
Who is this?
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
What?
You want to find them.
Yes.
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
What do you want?
What do you mean?
We don't know that --
Mine.
Have you always had it?
I don't know.
Have you looked inside?
Yes.
What's inside?
Humans.
Who?
You want me to stay?
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
Virginia...?
Need some gas?
Please.
Only got one kind.
Hell of a night.
You built things.
Bathroom?
Son ... are you awake?
We're going to be moving, son.
What's that, Dad?
Is the hill ours too?
If we want it, it is.
Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
There are more this year than last.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
Are you all right, Dad?
I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.
I had an awful dream.
What, Jim, what?
... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.
I was so scared.
What happened to you?  Who was that?
Where's your car?
I'm home now.
What did he talk to you about?
He was upset with moving, I believe.
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
May I ask why?
We were having a little talk.
I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
I'd believe him.
Why?
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
I don't see anything.
I swear it was here.
But it's not, Jimmy.
Does it look to you like anything landed here?
Who are you calling?
No one comes here after dark.
Damn.
But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
George, where have you been?
Your father asked you a question.
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
Oh?
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
It's really nice of you to help us.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
What do you want?
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
What?
Connie, don't hang up.
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
Just my luck, no ice.
I take it you've heard.
You still believe in him.
He's a good man.
Are you all right?
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
We're losing them.
What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
What the hell is this?
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
There's good news and bad news.
What's the bad news?
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
Can you believe this?
What're you talking about?
What happened?
Not really...
That signal. It's a countdown.
Then what?
I'm thinking.
What the hell is that?
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
Spunky?
College nickname.
Perfect, she's using it.
You punched the President in the face?
David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
I'm making a mess.
Pops, you're a genius!
What'd I say?
Oh shit, we're late.
What the hell are you doing?
Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
Get us out of here!
What're you doing?
We're loose!
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
I had a feeling you would.
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
Is my wife in the air?
Where are they?
How're we doing?
And our troops here?
Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
This is ridiculous.
A meteor?
No Sir. Definitely not.
How do you know?
Well, er... it's slowing down.
It's doing what?
He's trying to impress you.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
What?
Yes, I am.
Dick-weed!
You're late.
You scared the hell out of me.
Yeah, but what an entrance!
Dick-weed.
Your son.
He's my angel.
No. Exotic.
Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it...
Damn it!
I didn't even see them fire!
Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
We're already over Mach 2!
Stevie... I can't...
Stop it.
We're leaving, don't try and stop us.
What the hell's going on?
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
Mr. President?
Why did you people come here?
Here... now.
And before here?
Peace? No peace.
Oh, Sallah! What a relief!
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
Yes.
Yes.
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
Marcus!  I did it!
All your life.
What has the old fool got himself into now?
Venice, Italy!
That doesn't look much like a library.
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
Alexandretta. Now we know.
What about you?
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
Marcus!
Henry! What are you doing here?!
Henry, the pen --
Look what you did!
The Word of God...
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
That was our assessment as well.
An old man's dream.
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
I'm through!
Doctor Jones?
Yes?
And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
I usually don't.
I usually don't either.
It would make me very happy.
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
The Ark of the Covenant.
Are you sure?
It must be one of these...
Don't wander off.
I said go around!
You said go between them!
My room!
Mine, too.
This.
What do you know about this place?
What are you going to do?
This one. I think he's in here.
How did you get here?
All I have to do is squeeze.
I never expected to see you again.
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
Dad!
Out!
It's important!
Then wait -- count to twenty.
It is you Junior!
Don't call me that, please.
Oh, it breaks the heart.
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
Through the library?
He was actually there? You saw him?
...you did it.
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
If only I could have been with you.
There were rats, Dad.
Well, uh...
You did!!
Look, can we discuss this later?
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
I came here to save you.
No! Don't Shoot!
How did you she was a Nazi?
Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
What am I looking for?
My lucky charm.
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
The floor's on fire! See?!
What???
Dad!
What?
Dad!
What?
What?
Head for the fireplace!
This is intolerable!
Dad!
Stop!
Brody's this way.
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
What final challenge?
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
What about Marcus?
Marcus would agree with me.
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
I was the next man.
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
We didn't talk. We never talked.
You left just when you were becoming interesting.
Dad, how can you?
What does that mean?
I didn't know you could fly a plane.
Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
Nice landing.
Those people are trying to kill us!
It's a new experience for me.
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
Dad?
You call this archaeology?
Dad?!
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
Penitent. Penitent...
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
What did you find, Dad?
What did you find, Junior?
I like Indiana.
Ready?
Uh-huh.
That was seven hundred years ago.
You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
Get that camel out of the way!
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
I'm going after those horses.
I'll take the camels.
But, Indy --
Why are you trying to kill us?
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
Then we'll die.
This is your last chance.
Who are you?
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.
I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
That was a misunderstanding.
Dr. Jones.
Lao She.
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.
You have insulted my son.
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
Now what about the antidote, Lao.
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
Step on it, Short Round!
You got the tickets, Short Round?
Indy?
Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
I ride with you, Indy?
Indy, look!
What you look at, Indy?
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
You don't like him do you?
Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
Come one, what's wrong?
Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
Let up on the brake!
No, the stones are mine!
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
You will go to palace there.
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
It is Pankot Palace that kills my village.
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
I like the service here.
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!
What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!
What do you mean -- how?
God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
And then they took their children.
A what...?
Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?!
What?!
Don't let it pull you deeper!
It's pulling me deeper!
What?!
What's happening?
It's starting to let go!
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.
Couldn't keep away, huh?
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
Not leftovers?
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
Don't catch cold.
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
No -- don't you see -- crawling --
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
A fulcrum release lever!
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
Wait -- what're you doing?
I'm going down.
Yes.
So now they believe me.
What're we going to do?!
I can't!
And they don't even know what it really is.
I get it!
This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
Give me your hat...
I said something.
No, not her. Me.
My name is AL.
Where are you,...Al?
You're not gonna believe this...
Try me.
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
Arrrgh!
It wasn't him.
Who was it?
Me.
Who?
Al.
Yes?
Yes.
Your name is Al...
Yes.
I just got here.
Why don't we go home?
...I need to make a phone call.
Do me a favor, Al.
Somebody's been here.
Where are we now?
My place, can't you see?
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
Who are you?
Who am I?
I told you, my name is Al.
You've heard of the PEM114...
You've heard of U.S.T.?
I just went there for a job.
I know...it sounds insane.
What are you doing?
What for?
Kill myself.
Are you crazy?
You're not crazy.
Hear voices don't I.
Yeah.
You'll be alive.
What was that?
No they won't.
Why not?
Oh...Gooood!
Behind us?
What do I do?
Outrun them.
Now what?
I wouldn't say that.
I want out.
Too late...They want you.
Why? AL  You know too much.
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
I don't know...To get Al.
Did you hear that?
It can't take that long.
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
Yeah...Who is?
I am. You are.
What do you mean we.
You gotta help.
I did. I brought you back here.
Find You?
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
Sue them.
I don't like the sound of that.
Door's locked.
Now what.
Go out, take your first left.
Just walk down the hall?
Which way do I go?
What does it say.
Take a left and your next right.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
Who did?
What do you mean?
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
I'm back.
I'm at the airport.
Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
What am I supposed to do?
What do we do?
Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
You mean...just leave.
We get on a plane.
What about money?
What about it?
Use my credit cards.
I can't do that.
Why not?
It's illegal.
Who cares?
I'll get in trouble.
They'll know who I am.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
Oh yeah, to what?
Now what?
The beach.
What is it?
Swim.
Now what?
Eat it?
Eat it.
Why not?
Al, are you doing anything in there?
What? What do you mean?
Beautiful!
What was?
She's...pretty fast.
What is it?
You're beautiful..
What's happening?
She doesn't seem to understand.
Try another language.
Which language?
Help me out, will you?
What do I do?
.
Wait.
Touch her.
...Joe.
What happened?
Where are you going?
To the hotel. To register.
Without your pants.
Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
Well you did it today.
Now, where would I be?
But what's it look like?
You really like that shirt?
Much too blue.
Mind your own business.
It is my business. It's my name.
Not that tie with that coat.
What did that cost?
Which one is she?
They both look good to me.
Get close to them.
What glasses.
I feel like an idiot.
Which one?
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
Just don't show fear.
I don't know what's going on.
They're all in it.
How do you know?
Even Rene?
She's the toughest to read.
What is it, your charm?
This just won't work.
You're doing great with her.
Not her. You!
It's embarrassing.
What am I supposed to do?
You got any books in there?
Oh come on.
You shut down your sensors.
What Happened?
She's got the most beautiful...s
And on my time.
It's not your time. I get time off.
You been had. We have.
Some agent you are.
You found her.
Better. I found Ryuji.
Osaka.
Osaka?
What do I do?
Follow her.
On what?
Come on, she's getting away.
Sapporo..
Just stay here and rest.
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
What do I do?
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
I told you, I have a feeling...
Don't touch a thing.
...drink it.
What next!
I can't...
You have to! Quickly!
Door to the right. Get up and run.
I can't see a thing.
What?
He was with Gruner!
Probably.
It's him.
Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
I've got an idea.
You sure this will work?
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
What was it? What'd I say?
haka xuki.
haka xuki. What's that mean?
He hung us up dry.
While he makes the run.
Do it.
There's a lot you don't know.
Do something.
What exactly?
What happened?
Be quiet.
Never mind that, where are we now.
Rene?
She works for them.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
She is beautiful.
Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.
You're a lucky man.
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
You just got a Mickey.
Not that truth!
Doesn't matter.
What part what?
What is your name?
No!
Oh, I can't.
Can you fly this?
What kind of a deal?
I knew you were trouble.
What happened?
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
In him?
It's a long story.
They have stolen state property.
You didn't tell us you were coming?
You've cut your hair?
PEM115!
**?!! 
Surveillance Cameras?
They took the tapes.
We'll have to let them go.
What Job?
Who is your friend?
We met on the beach.
What are you doing here, where've you been?
I have a new client.
That crazy guy?
Yes?
Enough ROmance.
I don't want to intrude.
Al Viola.
That name's familiar.
And how do you service foreigners.
And...you know Jan Gruner?
What?
Your memory.
What about it?
It may have been affected.
Oh.
Oh...that's okay.
When you do...
Do what?
When you remember...
Right.
How do I look?
Fine. You look fine.
Thanks.
Well...
Well what?
Don't you want to get out?
You'll feel better
Joe.
Take the card.
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
Why would we want to hurt you?
Not you. Them.
Who?
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
Ahhh...nothing.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Not...complaining, actually.
Sue who?
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
Don't do it!
Just give me the keys.
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
The fresh tuna?..
Yes...What is it?
What's what?
What did you say?
Nothing.
I said...I didn't say..anything!
What do you do about what?
Is someone else here?
No. No one to speak of.
...Blake
I'll be right there.
Where?
Dinner...tonight.
And you.
...right here too.
I can't do that?
Do what?
Let you leave without it.
What way?
Wait. What's your name?
You mean from it.
You again.
Me still. They left you alone?
I waited for you.
Why?
...and sort of...disinterest.
As if your mind's not all there.
Can I help?
You are.
Promise you what?
You talk to yourself.
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
Why do you do it?
You're talking to me.
You're doing...Okay.
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
...Naw. Made that up.
Trans Ocean Travel.
Is that Ryuji?
No. Ryuji just hires us.
How often they come here?
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
And you, what do you like?
Joe! What happened to you?
Why did you leave?
They left. I had to go with them.
Why?
You seemed interesting.
Who else is interested in me?
What do you mean?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
What did you tell them?
There's not much to tell.
You work for Ryuji?
He didn't.
No.
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
You're leaving.
Food doesn't agree with me.
I'm leaving too.
This business is over.
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
He must be a good friend.
We're very close.
What'd he steal?
A chip. Goes in a computer.
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
How do you know you can trust me?
I don't know. He mentioned a city.
What is it?
Hiroshima.
You don't believe me.
Who was?
Where we going?
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
That must be him. Water taxi.
Hong Kong.
I asked him.
Chiang Cho?
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
You've  been there?
I know the territory.
So do I.
This going to work?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
Why not?
Can you?
What happened?
I can't fly it.
Looks like they can. What did they do?
They asked about you.
What did you tell them?
That I really don't know.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Why did you, then?
How?
Now what?
Just like that?
I'll come back for you.
Kiss her you fool.
Who are you? Who do you work for?
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
I knew it. I told him.
Now what?
He can't help us.
You are, I've seen you.
It wasn't me. It was him.
It was you.
He told me what to do.
Come on.
What is it?
He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
Yeah...I have to get away.
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
Is there anything else?
Why?
You can't take that.
Why not?
It's alright.
It will be fine. You have another.
Just one. The back up.
Could I have it, please.
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Tear it apart?
Yes.
Mom...what are you doing here?
Right there.
This the only spare?
Yes.
The other working.
Ow?...
It'l be alright.
It will.
It doesn't hurt.
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
What does he know?
Look, nobody knows we did it.
It'l take months.
So we better get started.
Hi, honey.
Hi, Daddy.
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
I'll take some.
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
I heard them.
Where?
He's into kind of little cars, that...
That remote control thing?
Yeah.
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
Mom.
How long?
Three hours.
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
We gotta hook up.
When's your deadline?
Monday.
Push it.
What? Forget it.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
Are you all right?
What does that do?
When's the air date?
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
What was that about?
Get me Wigand.
Sure.
Do you want more rice?
Maybe later.
What are you cooking?
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm not touching my film...
I'm afraid you are.
Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
A gun? Yes.
What caliber is your gun?
What caliber is my gun?
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
That computer has everything...
Debbie...
What about you, you got a crew already?
Okay. 
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
No, no, we're fine...
Mike... Mike... Mike...
What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"
Hey, Lowell.
Hi, baby.
Hello?
Okay.  Lowell?
I can take her.
Is there any more rice...?
Uh, what are those boxes?
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
Soy sauce...
Right now?
That's my stuff from the office...
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
Why? Who said?
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
Use the bathroom.
Thank you, Bob.
Who's calling?
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
"60 Minutes"?
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
Will independent sources corroborate that?
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye. 
What's wrong?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
What are you and Mike going to do?
I'm alone on this...
Jeffrey Wigand...
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
Get some perspective, Lowell.
I got perspective.
Yeah...
Yeah.
Alright?
You eating with us?
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
Hardly new news.
No shit.
So, is everything okay?
Oh, man.
Lowell!
What?
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
I disappeared on you?
Alright. What did you think?
Oh, please, Mike...
Yeah... Thank you.
How have you liked your stay?
Look, I really don't have that much time...
...but that's as far as I go...
Should I just take the documents now?
...protect your sources...! You screwed me! You sold me out!
Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
Why am I gonna mention your name?
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
The new place? New.
How'd you know that, Lowell?
What did you get us?
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
You believe that?
You believe that?
They do this with impunity!
Good. But Jeff...
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
You attract a crowd.
You mean... since this morning?
No.
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
You manipulated me into this...!
That's bullshit, Jeff!
Where are you, anyway?
You try and have a good time.
Did he hear you?
What's happening?!
What are you talking about?
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
What do you mean there is no family?
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
Object to the form of the question!
It acts as a drug on the body?
Object to the form!
It acts as a...
Well, I wouldn't say --
Baby. You are so HOT!
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
So she's uh, flourishing?
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
I'd just like to have a word with her.
Who's the pigeon?
You're in a rush.
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
Triple!
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
Objection, your honor!
Grounds?
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
We rest, Your Honor.
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
I don't need it.
You want Botox?
Why in God's name would I want...?
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
It was a gift from a client.
Got any symptoms?
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
I'm happy for you, pal.
Thanks, buddy.
Is she Asian?
Asian? No.
I have it.
No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
It's your move, Miles.
My God.
What?
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
Marylin! What have I done?
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
So who'd you hire?
No.
You're vulnerable.
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
Oh boy. If he only knew.
It sounded like a bell.
These are yours.
I assume this is on Rex?
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
Did you see the tape?
But you don't agree?
How do you know?
Why would you be here?
No.
You don't believe in it.
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
You just haven't met the right person.
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
He'll regret this.
To him? He's a sick freak.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
So I hear. Is that all?
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
Hello?
Miles?
Screw you, asswipe!
No. Don't stop.
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
Is that you?
Me. Yes.
Oh. And that is -- mom?
She never particularly cared for me.
She held that against you?
Apparently she was very disappointed.
And here I thought my mother was...
Your mother was.
We're damaged goods.
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
What is it Miles?
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
Yes, Miles. I accept.
I don't have a ring!
I know.
Good.  Are those foods?
Hi.
Hello Marylin.
I have a surprise for you.
I love you. I want to have your baby.
Comfy!
What do you want?
STUFF.  Got a light?
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
That's blackmail.
Hello?
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
Please! Leave the house.
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
It's a no go, Joe.
Wait! He works for YOU?
Now. But first, he worked for you.
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
Hello Marylin.
You wounded me first, Marylin.
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Forgery? Fraud?
Income tax evasion?
Murder?
Sweet.
Rex. Get away from the door.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
Hello, Rex.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
I was devastated. Of course.
Is this a lover?
Forgery and Fraud?
He never even asked. He just assumed --
He was right, wasn't he?
You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
Miles Massey.
Of Massey Myerson?
Lilly's up.
Every week --
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
Is this Ming?
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
Wait. I know you.
Herb wants to see me?
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
Oh brother. Here we go.
Are you familiar with Kirshner?
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
Where does that leave us?
Mr. Rexroth.
Thank you.
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
Mm.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
I don't know. I can assume...
I think that went as well as could be expected.
She always looked out for me.
And she had private investigators assisting her.
She brought my digestive enzymes.
In anticipation of making you sick.
Nothing.
And she has...?
Video.
Wrigley!
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
I am very sorry.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
What are they?
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
Wrigley?
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there.
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
Three is not Farrow.
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
OhMary
How is she?
Whyuhshe's all right, sir.
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Oh, no, sir. No different than
Mr. Warne?
Yeah.
And this is what you wantthirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
What ten thousand?
The reward.
You're a peculiar chap.
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
Because marrying that fool King Westley is
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
Where are you taking me?
South America.
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
I'll get it annulled.
What've you got against King Westley?
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
Ellie
Oh, hello, Dad.
I knocked several times.
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
Oh, yes. I heard.
No.
I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
It'll do no good.  He despises me.
I'd like to have a talk with him.
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
No, I'll go through with it.
Peter Warne! 
Why? Do you know him? 
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
I'm sorry you read it.
Are you going to see him?
I'll be going.  Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
She hasn't had a thing yesterdayor today.
Been sending her meals in regularly?
Yessir. She refuses them all.
It's my daughter! Go after her.
You talk as if
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
We've done that already.
What happened?
What do they say?
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
All right, let it go.
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
Oh, yeah?
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
Tell that man not to drive so fast. 
Are you talking to me?
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
What am I going to do now?
You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
Why, noI  Yes . . . I guess I will.
I don't want it reported!
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
My ticket?
I didn't ask for your advice. 
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
That's none of your business.
Now, just a minuteyou can't
Are you talking to me!
Darn clever, these Armenians.
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
Oh, you did? What am I expected to doleap for joy?
Your ego is colossal.
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
Do you mind putting out the light?
You've got a name, haven't you?
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  Youyou had it pressed.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
I can't go out like this.
Like what?
Like this. I have no robe.
Where'd you say the showersand thingswere? 
Heyyou're little, aren't you?
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
I thought maybeuh"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Santa Claus?
KingKing Westley was in it.
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Oh, so now I was drunk!
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story?
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
Not as long as I'm alive.
What do you meanstarvation?
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
To New York?
Yeah.
I'm following you.
Aren't you afraid of me?
No.
This isn't "piggy-back."
Of course it is.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride
Not a one.
This looks like the best spot.
Peter
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
Well, take them off.
What's the matter?
Oh, Peter 
What's got into you?
knowbut
Here. Eat your head off.
I don't want it now.
Thought you were hungry!
wasbut
was so scaredthat it scared
Sure.
What are you thinking about?
No. But I've got a penknife. 
Carrots.
Raw?
There's no end to your accomplishments.
You think it's simple, huh?
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
What're you going to do?
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
Why not? I'm hungry.
Eat a carrot.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
Come onget in.
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on
Come on! come on! 
What'd you give him for the car?
Better go back to your bed.
I love you.
I hope you got your money.
You bet I did.
Congratulations.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
ONETWOTHREEFOURFIVE
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
sixseveneightnine
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
No, it isn't. I'm hungry andand scared.
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
Not interested. 
Where's the bus to New York?
Eight o'clock tonight.
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
When does the bus leave?
In about fifteen minutes.
Yesif he is your husband.
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
But can't you wait until morning
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
What time is it?
I'm hungry.
The old man's screwy!
What's 'at?
What's up?
Yeah? Where?
Up yonder. See the lights?
Yeah.
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Collect?
Get out of here!
Wait a minute, GordonI
Joe, listen
What's the thousand bucks for?
If it's on the level.
Well, I got it, Joe.
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
I'd put you there myself.
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
I am, Joe.
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
ain't got a hat
What?
Funny couple, ain't they?
What do you reckon that's for?
Send it collect.
Collect?
There you gotrustin' people again. How many times did I tell you
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Thenyou'll have to git !
Not a minute!
Yeah.
Zeke.  Git!
There's a seat over there for you.
Wife?
What's on your mind?
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
I can use a smart guy like you.
Yeahthe "big boy"the Boss of the outfit.
Where do you live?
Orange, New Jersey.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Yeah. Just babies.
Oh, gee, Misteryou wouldn'tyou ain't thinkin' about
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
The fact is he's gone, chief, and so's our case.
You know you keep saying that.
Keep saying what?
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
What's the other name?
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
Can you get some sworn statements?
All right, all right.  Break it up.
Where you going, boss?
I did.
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
No, I did not.
...ever called Dean Andrews?
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
No, I did not.
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
What did they...
You still questioning any Cubans?
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
I believe the boys got a couple.
Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Daddy!  Where have you been?
Are we going away, Daddy?
He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
How many shots you say you heard?
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
I'm sorry.
No.  Never heard of him.
No.
Who?
No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
Hi.
Tough day.
Did they live?
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
They killed him, honey.
One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
I'd say he was probably getting intelligence training.
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
Some people would say you're paranoid.
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
More than ten years.
And he never hit you before?
I don't know if I should talk about this.
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
She's the best damn witness we have!
They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?
If you must know, virtually nothing.
Yes?
Virginia or Elizabeth?
Yes.
Do you walk home?
Not a problem.
I know. That's why I went.
But then you told her you were home.
I understand.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
I'll call her.
Won't forget?
You were there for me.
Who?
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
What?
I need a favor.
That requires me goin' out tonight?
Let me finish. Can I finish?
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
Look, man, I know I owe you --
Does he have the marked bills on him?
How'd you know where he was?
And you didn't tell the Police?
Great, you're here.
What's going on?
She almost sounds scared.
What's she want?
She wants to go back to work.
My pocketbook.
What's in it?
What's this?
Take your time.
But now you're telling us now you do.
You don't want much, do you?
How was your flight?
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
What's her name?
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
Are you really a bail bondsman?
Can I see your I.D.?
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
Can we stop for cigarettes?
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
I don't think so.
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
I thought you might want a drink?
I'd love one, but not there.
Is it dark?
It's kind of a sports bar
That doesn't sound dark.
You're not tired of it?
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
Ordell pick up his bond?
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
I didn't?
No, you didn't. What branch?
He's the one who wants you.
With ten thousand? Nine.
If you're having some.
Thanks, but I have my own now.
What, I couldn't hear you?
Somebody loan it to you?
Want to hear some music?
This is pretty.
Uh-huh.
Who is this?
The Delfonics.
'76?
'74, I think.
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
How'd you find that out?
He told me last night.
He called you?
He came by.
What?... What'd you do?
You're gonna offer to set him up?
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
How do you feel about getting old?
You're not old. You look great.
My ass ain't the same.
Bigger?
Well, hello.
I walked right past you.
Catching a movie.
What'd ya see?
"American President"
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
And Annette's it for you?
Who was your girl before Annette?
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
I'm old enough to be her father.
How old's Annette?
I go back to work tomorrow.
They seem to like the idea.
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
Right around here, in the food court.
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
What about you Max?
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
You do that?
That's my job.
And is that it?
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
It'll be more than that.
Where's the rest of it?
In the bag underneath.
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Set him up.
Tell him you want to see him?
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
Did you tell him you were leaving?
I didn't say you did.
I never lied to you.
I know.
Where're you going?
Spain.
Thanks, but you have a good time.
Sure I can't twist your arm?
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
I thought you were tired of your business?
I'm just tired in general.
Who's side are you on?
I beg your pardon?
What if I plead guilty?
And cooperate? You might get probation.
Most of the times.
Sometimes every day, for a while.
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
He say is a surprise.
Oh, Miss Brown?
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
What the fuck is that shit?
I know what it looks like.
We'll just be a minute.
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
You know what we want.
He sells guns.
You talk to him?
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
I imagine shit needs to be done.
Not yet.
I'm sure that was the idea.
She told you that?
Uh-huh.
She didn't say.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
You didn't count it?
Yes. All those things are true.
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
You took the time to pay the saleswoman.
There was a guy with Melanie?
I have no idea.
You'd take a polygraph on it?
If it'll make you happy.
What about me?
Oh, hi.
Buy ya a beer?
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
Sure.
Uh-uh.
How long you been with Ordell?
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
Beaumont Livingston?
You already knew that?
Keep it between us girls?
What's that fucker ever done for us?
Jackie?
Hi, Melanie.
Are you getting that black suit?
Yeah, do you like it?
It looks good on you.
Do you got something for me?
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
I got some vodka in the freezer.
Got some o.j.?
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
Beaumont Livingston.
Yeah?
What do you think it is?
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
What the hell you doin'?
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
I said, you understand what I'm saying
I understand woman, damn!
I got a problem...
The Cockatoo Inn.
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
How the fuck they know that?
You told em? You told em it's me?
You told them that?
A woman.
If you want.
No, I give it to someone else first.
That's the idea.
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
Managers get ten percent.
I'll give ya ten.
Plus the same deal as before.
Uh-huh.
Who?
How do you know she did that?
I was there, I saw her do it.
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
She don't know shit about the money.
Who's paging you?
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
It's boring, isn't it?
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
Want a hit?
When did you get out of jail?
Four days ago.
Where at?
Susanville.
How long?
Two months shy of four years.
Four years?
Uh-huh.
What for?
Bank robbery.
Is it ready to go?
Want a Metrix?
Which one?
The roller disco one.
You're fourteen years old here?
Yeah.
No.
Where were you?
Detroit.
With Ordell?
Were you a disco guy?
No.
C'mon, don't lie.
I don't like dancing.
That's a picture of me in Japan.
You been to Japan?
I lived there for about nine months.
You lived in Japan, when?
About five years ago.
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
Wanna fuck?
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
Is it dead?
He killed a man worked for him the other night.
He went to meet that stewardess.
Please.
Uh-huh?
We're leaving now!
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
Lemme have the bag.
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
Yeah, down the end.
This one.
Thanks, Baby.
What's your cost?
As low as two.
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
Guess where I am?
You're outside?
Uh-huh.
Who was that?
That was Beaumont.
I didn't look like a bum.
How much is there?
Sure.
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
I still don't understand why you keep her around.
Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge.
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
You shot Melanie?
Couldn't talk to her?
You know how she is.
You couldn't just hit her?
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
Uh-huh.
So you're sure she's dead.
Pretty sure.
Louis?
What?
Where's the rest of it?
How much it there?
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
How long was she in there?
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Then what?
We went to the parking lot.
Where you shot her.
Fuck you for asking me that.
What'd you shoot her with?
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
Jesus Christ.
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
I'm going out for a few hours.
Cops can't locate him, huh?
How can I help you?
That's Winston. He works here.
Gonna have to put up cash.
What's his full name?
Beaumont Livingston.
Haven't a clue.
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
House or apartment?
Hey, Max.
I can see that. Why?
I got some more business for ya.
Somebody already did.
What?
You didn't hear?
Brown, Jackie Brown.
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
I got it. I just don't got it on me.
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
Where is it?
I thought you might be asleep.
I'm alone.
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
How'd you find me?
Winston found you.
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
Uh-huh.
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
All I did was walk out with it.
And you did that to protect my interest?
And where's Jackie?
She's been there since Thursday night.
She was afraid.
Have her bring the money here.
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
It's the next street.
I know where it is.
Turn left.
My money's in that office, right?
No.
Get that for me, will ya baby?
Who is it?
We're back.
Cherry Bail Bonds.
He leave town?
Give me his home number.
Get me out of here.
Take me home.
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
What are you then?
I'm alive.
Then what are you doing here?
What isn't happening?
Dream on!
No, thanks.
I see.
What do you want?
Just to see you. That's all.
Well, how do I look?
Hello, Sam.
Are you all right?
Daddy!
Oh God!
You're hurting me!
Stop!!!!
Daddy. Let go.
What do you want from me?
You have an unusual hand.
It's short, huh?
Short? It's ended.
Hello.
It's hard to explain.
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
What do you mean?
Maybe there's a larger truth.
What are you talking about?
Maybe the demons are real.
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
I'm hanging up.
Hey, wait!
Daddy, what was that noise?
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
There was a bang.
It's cold.
Tell your mother.
Wait ... Daddy.
Now what?
Doctor.  Ph.D.
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
Why do you say that?
But the paper ...
What do you mean, demons?
How long had that been going on?
He say what they looked like?
... I've seen them, too.
Dr. Carlson's dead?
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
What can I tell you?
I saw Sarah the other day.
Her knee acting up?
A bit.
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
She hates me, Louis.
I can't relax.
Louis, you're a life saver.
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
I'm walking, aren't I?
It's good to see you.
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
No.  I see them.
Christ, I know how it sounds.
I don't know what to say.
Carlson? Is he new here?
What's your name?
It's freezing.
Go to sleep.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
Jacob, what can I do?
They stole it.
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
Why didn't you turn on the light?
I didn't want to wake you.
Gee, thanks a lot.
Where is the lamp?
I moved the couch. That's all.
That help?
What do you think?
What do you mean?
The room!
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
What happened to you?
You up?
No. Have you seen my glasses?
Where'd you leave 'em?
I don't know.
Did you look around the headboard?
Jezzie, I can't see.
Thanks.  What's that?
Your kid dropped it off.
Who? Jed?
No. The little one.
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
They're weird names.
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
Yeah, but for what?
A good lay.
And look what I got.
I must have been out of my head.
Why you left.
What do you mean you can see?
She looked good then.
Not to me.
I don't like things that make you cry.
Jake!
Why do you bring her up?
'Cause she's always on your mind.
When was the last time I said a word?
Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
They weren't human!
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Oh, come on. It's early.
Where are we?
We're at Della's.
What do you mean? Where do you think?
Why? What for?
Show me Della!
Can't you stop it?
What's it say? A hundred and two?
What does it say?
It's gone to the top.
How high is that?
What the hell are you doin'?
Get your clothes off.
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
He's coming right over.
That's your decision.
I can't do it.
Don't gimme that.
Lie down!
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Help me! Help me!
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
I love you, Jez.
I know.
He did? When?
While you were in the shower.
What? What do you mean?
He said you didn't have one.
It's just me.
Jezzie?
Who else were you expecting?
Stay away from me, Jez.
Don't!
It might be for me.
Are you out of your mind?
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
Me neither.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
I promise.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
Sit down, Jake.
Where are they?
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Where have they gone?
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
I don't know you.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
You look upset.
I'm not upset.
Jake, what is it?
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
You can have anything you want.
Mid-town mostly.
Oh?  Where you going?
West.
Where's West? New Jersey?
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Sit down, Jake.
Where are they?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Where have they gone?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
You come here often?
How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
One drop?
I think I'm falling asleep.
I can't move.
And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
Well that's good to know.
I would have stayed there if I could.
I don't know what to say.
I no from around here.
They're awfully heavy.
How was Palm Springs?
Hot. Where do I sign?
Push 'em back.
For what? For seeking the truth?
You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
Dream on!
He's burning up.
Total delirium.
He'll never make it.
I'll page him.
Call my chiropractor.
We're doing everything we can.
Where am I?
Lennox Hospital.
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
This is not a dream! This is my life.
Hello.
Jacob Singer?
Speaking.
Paul Gruneger!
Count 'em on one hand.
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
Still married, Jake?
Why the hell we drivin' here?
I just need to talk.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
What's goin' on Paul?
I don't know.
You in trouble?
Why not?
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
I don't know what to do.
What do you mean?
I've seen them too ... the demons!
Oh God. I know. I know.
Died?
A car accident.
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
How did it happen?
No one knows. They say it blew up.
Do you want me to get someone?
I have some ice from the machine.
Bring it in.
Pour it in.
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
Watch it punk, I'm armed.
He's not part of the program.
Yes it does.
Okay, enough of this shit.
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
We're not leaving Crutch!
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
What are you doing?!!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
We can't lead him into the other hull!
His mother?
What?
Minimal.
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
Bomb?
Can't shut em' down from here.
Uh-oh.
What?!
Okay that hurt.
Where have you been?!!
Where the hell were you?!!
Creepy.
You see that?
Better let me.
Everyone okay?
Shit!
The hull's imploding!
We're not supposed to do that.
I'll need system four converters.
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
Done!
Goodbye, my love.
Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
We'd need charges.
How many?
I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
Then what do we do?!
It bought us some time.
Earth II.
Get them in the lab!
I am an expert!
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
What the hell are you doing?
Yllo, what's your head count?
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
You just keep an eye out.
Sergeant!
I'm with you kid.
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
Jesus, God!
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
Kicker, anything?
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Where is everybody? What happened?
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Give me a break! What happened?
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
Pull me in!
Where are you going?
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
Med-kit?
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
See? We're not so bad.
Got it.  You ever space walked?
His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work.
You wanna release your air tanks?
Okay, good tip.
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
Did you like it?
Delongpre, you don't even know me.
Rizzo, pull away!
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
Spunky . . .
Well?
She needs a little time.
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
Yuck.
Go-go-go-go-go!!!!
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
Kaboom.
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.
They'll make it.
Close the fucking door!
Now that's just gross.
Now this is getting exciting.
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
I'm gonna spew.
You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.
Hurry! She's lost it!
You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
You're so bossy.
You're quicker than usual.
Later.
Jesus!
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
What do we do?!!
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
I don't know...sorry?
Robot huh?
Kay-em 14.
Barbie from hell...
I didn't say I was good at it.
It's just you and me, then.
Almost done.
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Sorry, sorry.
Who are you apologizing to?
Kay-em you okay?
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
I missed you too.
Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
Kicker!
Leave him behind!
What?
How do you know?
Something's wrong.
The power's back up!
Then open the doors!
What?!!
I gotta go back.
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
Nanotechnology.
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
But...I...400 years?
You're not going anywhere.
You wanna die?
What good will that do?
More soldiers?
Guys, please come with me!
It's okay, he just wanted his machete.
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
Hockey player? He's not a ...
What have you done?
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
Can we get through these?
Guys, he's right behind us!
Son! -- Out of the water now!
My boat's neat, dad!
You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
My cars. And a comic book.
Did you bring a check?
And incidental damages, if any...
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
This is Matt Hooper...
I know who he is...
What do you mean 'We...?'
Who's driving the boat?
What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
I never saw one that big.
Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.
C'mon. Middle appendix --
What's that one, there?
Where...?
That's it! Radio in for help!
Shut up! Just pump her out!
Did you get him in the head?
He's trying to sink us!
He's chasing us! I don't believe it.
Right.
Do you see the kids?
Like you're from N'Yawk. 
I never hear the whistle.
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
Be careful.
You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
Can you stand something to eat?
Mikey loves his birthday present.
Where is he?
It's three feet deep, Martin
You too, sweetheart...
Home... New York?
Colorful, isn't he?
You going to be all right?
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
What'll I tell the kids?
Only 24 hours!
He lost it on the way up.
Got a pen on you?
My kids were on that beach...
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Who are you?
Dynamite!  How was your day...?
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
What stinks so bad?
How can you tell?
Florida license plate.
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
Why don't we just tow it in?
I hope we get some more help.
This has got to be one big violation...
What's that, a ship?
What the hell?
What day is this?
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
Think the tide's with us?
Just keep kicking.
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
You picked her up on the ferry.
I didn't know her.
And nobody else saw her in the water?
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
You here for the summer?
Some friends and me took a house.
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream.
We're not even sure what it was.
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
You wanna call it a night after here?
It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
Leg of lamb this time?
Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
Would you like something? Some coffee?
You're leaving?
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?
He's busy.
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
Transplants?
I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
Let it go, don't waste your time.
I'm okay...
20 feet, if it's an inch...
Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
I'll drink to your leg.
Easy! It'll tear right out!
He's heading under -- !
Follow him!
Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
I don't think so.
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
Thanks for the message.
You know how I feel about her.
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
Hey Bleek.
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
I don't know...
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
Whose idea was it?
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
But you copy my work every week.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
Okay, cool.
Jesus, Bleek.
We could get back together too.
I don't like Katrina.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
You're being really immature.
Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
I still have your virginity!
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
Wait, let me take that.
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
Yeah. That was me.
You know it's okay.
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
Can we make out now?
Hey man.
Oh, hey Vijay.
Yup.
Did you hear it's yours?
Yup.
What a trip, man.
I don't really know anything about it.
No... I guess not.
What is your job title, exactly?
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
I have no idea how to spit this out.
But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend.
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
You don't know anything about me!
Wow, dream big!
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
I'm a junior.
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
Viscera?
Blood and guts.
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
What do you play?
I rock a Harmony.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
Your guitar is named Kimber?
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
Why aren't you at work?
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
No, more commercial stuff.
Like what?
Commercials.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
Junk?
You know... it's parts...
I know what junk is.
It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
That suits you.
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
Oh really? What's the verdict?
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
Wow. That shirt is working hard.
Is Vanessa here?
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
What?
I actually know this one.
Oh, okay. Like this.
You've never been to a dance, have you?
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
I'm leaving Vanessa.
No.
You should try Adderall.
I heard that was you.
Can I take your coats?
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.
Nothing...
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
Elbow.
Juno? What's going on?
Hi. I'm here for the big show?
Your name, please?
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
Or...
Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?
I am a suicide risk.
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
Only the one in my pants.
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
The Penny Saver sucks.
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
Hly shht!
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
No way! She's pretty.
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
So. What's that thing?
A Pilates machine?
What do you make with that?
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
You guys are playing music?
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
Hm.
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
Like what? Be a rock star?
We're actually, finally doing this?
Looks like it, yeah.
Yeah, downtown.
A hotel?
It's a loft.
You lose!
Hi, I'm Adele.
...I said, I like your hair.
Are you takin' the pictures?
...Yeah.
Is it hard to learn?
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
What's this?
It's a portfolio of my work.
You took this picture?
That's me.
No it is not!
Do what?
Adele... are you serious?
What's Early been in jail for?
Carryin' a gun.
...That's not true.
What?
Happy birthday Adele.
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
What if they're dangerous?
Geez, they look kinda weird.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
Yeah but, what is it?
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!
What's your name, boy?
Not so good. You sure you have to?
Where you from Walter?
Vernon, Florida.
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
...Mind if I hold that Bible?
You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
Can't hurt.
How much do I owe you?
This the book your writing?
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
Who?
That bad?
Dahlia, no.
Yeah.
Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
If you say so.
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.
So how's it going?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
Up yours.
All set?
Fuck!
What is it?
There's more...
Brian I want him out of our car!
Carrie, watch for Early.
What about you?
Any word from that gallery?
Not yet.
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
Bri'.
Where's Adele?
...Need a hand with those bags?
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
...never?
Early, just think...
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
What is it?
What happened?
Who are you?
Could be.
What about the owner of the house...  ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?
...Diebold?
...That'd be my guess.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
Umm. Altogether?
Yes. Altogether.
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
Yes.
With how many people?
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
Shit.
What do you think?
Oh shit. How long did it take?
Did what take?
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
You know what else?
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
Did you tell her that you loved her?
What do you want?
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
You wanna go to Paul's house?
You think?
Probably.
He lives on 76th?
78th.
Telly.
Yeah.
You thirsty?
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
You got any money?
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
You down with the boost?
I wanna fuck Darcy.
Who?
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
I don't understand why you do that.
Why I do what?
That.
Why I give pennies?
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
How much you gonna take?
About ten. Fifteen is good.
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
Casper! Was up kid?
Right here.
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
You goin'?
Na.
Man we fucked him up.
What?
Sup then? Sup?
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
Right now?
Yeah. Come on.
Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps.
At the block party?
I thought you had a girlfriend.
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Do you like kissing me?
I'm nervous.
I just know. I know you'll love it.
I don't want you to hurt me.
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
What is it?
No...
What do I want to do?
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
Do you care about me?
Dance!
What?
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
Telly is at Steven's?
How old are you?
I tested positive?
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
You're OK?
Miss, would I be prying?
Yeah, I guess so.
No.
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
The pain. The fucking pain!
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
I know.
Did you bleed?
I didn't bleed.
You didn't?
Passion...
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
Wish me luck.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
I was like yes! I'm going out with him!
Yep.
Making love is like.
Yeah.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
Yeah?
You've heard the stories right?
So that's why Casper is how he is.
Yep.
Holy shit. That's all true?
No. I was just kidding.
Mom.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
When are you gonna be back?
Not too late.
Four-thirty in the morning?
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
Hello?
It's me. Telly.
Hello?
So, how many people live here now?
I don't know, eight or nine.
Slow.
Yeah.
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
By yourself?
We seem to have a little problem here?
Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
You are!  I don't like you.
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
Morpheus.
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
How'd you get in here?
The door was open.
What do you want?
You got it on the board.
No, I need the original note.
He's not talking about himself.
Then let's narrow it down.
I'm positive.
Yes you are.
The message!  I figured out--
I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
Take it easy.  Both of you.
Sorry.
What is it?
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
A few people.
Did anyone stand out?
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
Don't fuck with us!  Where did you go!
Hello, Peter.
Hello, Peter.
Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
To get your attention.
Did you know her?
Where is she?
You know her?
Not really.
Why her?
Because she's the type.
But you said you didn't know her.
Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just."
Have you any idea what the message is?
What makes you think I was there?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
What word did you leave last night?
Hello, Peter.
Please... wait.
The game's over.  You lost.
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
Very good.  How did you know?
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
There's three.  The first is 1983. Lionel Baines.  The Boston...
What is it?
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
It worked out alright, didn't it?
Feeling better?
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
Why did he?
Come here.
You must be Erica.
Uh huh.
Do you like my dad?
I know he really likes you.
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
Okay.  Nice meeting you.
Congratulations, dad.
What are you doing up?
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
That has nothing to do with it.
What is it, dad?
You ready?
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.
It isn't Kathy.
How long has she been dead?
Six, eight hours tops.
No prints.
Same as the others?
Yeah.
How long she been dead?
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
We're not sure.
I'm busy right now.
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
The most logical choice.
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
Do you know how she found the apartment?
Could you tell me where you were last night?
You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.
Another one?  What word did he leave?
It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
Where were you last night?
Answer the question.
Jeremy would have never killed himself.
Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell.
He knows you're aware of that.
You have something you want to say?
About what?
Whatever's on your mind.
What do you see here?
Mate in five.
No.
Feel like practicing?
I can check and call you back.
Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
What are they, please?
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
Are you with the tournament?
When I was very young.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
It is.
Do you always open quickly?
Well, I think I've had enough.
What are you looking for?
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
You sure you don't want to eat something?
You sound like my mother.
I think it's interesting.
Another kind of game?
In a way.
Do you?
You mean like in the steam room?
Of course.
Why?
No.
I know it was bad.
I know you didn't
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
Doesn't that scare you?
No.
Why?
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
Wasn't I just talking about me?
No.  You were talking about chess.
Alright.  What about me?
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
She died in a car accident.
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
I'm not playing a game now.
Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
I just don't want to fight with you.
You've got to face the things you feel.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
I'm hungry.
You.
Did you call?
They're not delivering.  I'm going to go pick up the pizza.
I thought you said the line was busy?
I tried again and got through.
What's wrong?
For emphasis?
What?
Hi.
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
But I do.
Why?
This letter.  I've never opened it.
Why not?
Because I know what it says.
Frank told me.
You're right.  The killer told me.
You're going to be late for your match.
Are you going to come tonight?
You beat him.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
We're almost married.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
I lied.
About what?
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
Lyssa ...
Colwyn ...
I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
You must move away from the Center.
I don't know how.
Take the western passage.
In the Arctic ice.
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
You will go alone.
The White Castle has fallen.
Does the Queen live?
The new Queen lives.
There is no other way.
There is nothing.
Reach out farther. Call to her.
You have not slept in two days.
I can't reach her.
What do you see?
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
<u>Why</u>?
I'm not sure.
But you suspect.
Yes.
He has come for Lyssa.
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
She must make a glaive.
The spiral begins in the west.
I chose the wrong passage.
She can see the Beast!
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
No! You cannot know that!
I can. Because I choose it.
Slayers!
Do not let the waters touch you.
They can be saddled.
It is today?
Each to his fate.
Yes.
You too are lonely.
Let me comfort you.
I cannot take comfort when she has none.
You will not, then?
What business?
Once is enough, thank you.
My <u>friend</u>.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
Hah! You don't know me, boy.
And where do you lead, boy?
To the place where Death lives.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
When did you last sleep, boy?
I'm not hungry.
Not sleepy, either?
You've eaten nothing.
Hand over your dinner.
Go. I command you.
We could reach it on fire-mares.
Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
Where are you going?
We'll meet you at the inn.
Can't I come, too?
My heart stays here.
No.
Sugarballs?
I have a cinnamon bar.
You do?
I'm hungry.
I'd wish for a puppy.
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
I only want one.
Would you desert your friends?
Put me down, you lout!
What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
And do you think I live on air?
We have plenty of hares.
Oh, my poor stew!
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
He didn't join them. They joined him.
They'll trample him to death!
He will not!
He will come for me.
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
You were attacked in the forest?
Yes. We lost five.
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
We seek the Fortress of Krull.
The new King.
With an old voice?
It is the time.
Can you see?
Knowledge I wouldn't want.
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
The Widow of the Web?
She has the power of vision.
Her name is Death.
Few have survived it.
I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
Who speaks that name!
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
I was beautiful then.
She was not as beautiful.
No, she was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?
We had no children.
You had a son.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
Do not try your trickery on me!
It is no trickery.
You see?
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
What's that man's name?
Give me his name, I will mail him.
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
Yeah... How do you know it?
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
...You moved too, didn't you?
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
Take...
OK, I'm fine.
Huh... 500 meters?
Wow! It's brilliant!
Who'll I aim at?
OK.
The yellow and pink.
Come on, get down!
You were scared, weren't you?
Mathilda? May I come in?
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
Not taken.
Why?
...I'm going to kiss you.
When I say I love you.
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
...OK.  I love you anyway.
What shall we do?
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
It's too big.
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
...No...
How many girlfriends did you have?
...I don't know.
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
Yes.
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?
I don't know... Five minutes.
How shall we get out now, Leon?
Yes?
...I got lost, Mister.
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
Don't fear.
How are you, Miss?
I'm sick with practicing, that's it...
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
...Composer.
Huh, that's good!
Huh?
You can't sit here like that.
...And how much is it?
Can I sit on the stairways now?
...Who sent you?
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
Salute.
He probably just went somewhere.
What is it?
This smells good.
Why am I such an authority?
I have new dreams now.
It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
What if you don't make it?
Are you two planning kids?
I have to finish first.
What would you like us to do?
How long does this... Mania last?
This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.
So what's the deal Maurice?
You do?
I've seen it before.
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
Yes?
You thought I sent them?
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?
Ellen?
What?
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
What it is -- is the truth.
No.
Then why?
Show me.
Walk with me?
I thought we both wanted the same things.
I've changed my mind.
I want children.
Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --
Your father?
He's plastered.
I think it's a different place for each person.
Where?
Maurice?
The beach of Pacifica, California.
If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
To where?
Pacifica, California.
From where?
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Doubts?  About what?
Red flags man.
Shit!  He jumped!
Well, hello.
Each inch represents 150 miles...
What was that?
This story is big huh?
Mammoth.
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
Yes.
When are you leaving?
Walking where?
The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening.
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
You're walking to California?
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
She knew you loved her.
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
What Mr. Parker?
Tom Joad?
... The Grapes of Wrath.
I missed you Kris.
Are they standing?
Come on Mr. Parker.
Where am I?
In a hospital.
You're in pain.
Good morning.
Is it a boy or a girl?
Hello, Mr. Parker.
Hello.
What's your shoe size?
I really want that watch.
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
What do you want?
What do you think I should get?
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
...Noooo.
Orange soda?
No.
Coffee?
No.
Sparkling apple cider?
No.
Water?
Hello!
Hello.
Sarah -- with an H?
We can go to one if you'd prefer.
I guess I do too.
You what?
Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
Mind if I use the bathroom?
Want a drink? I'm having one.
Do you want to fuck now?
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
To death?
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
If I was I'm sorry.
This is the home of an angel.
You OK out there?
Thank you. What time is it?
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
Don't you like me, Ben?
Ben?
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
What was that all about?
Can we just forget it?
I don't understand any of that.
Please!
Yes... I'll give you that.
Do you want me not to go tonight?
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
I like it here with you.
There are limits.
How much, do you think?
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
Where are you staying?
Right here at the hotel. Why?
You have been lonely?
You have been lonely?
Where have you been staying?
It is, after all, Sera, my money.
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
Yes? What?
Yuri... are you...
Harvard Law School?
That's right.
But it's a top three school --
What alibi?
I can't tell you.
Were you with another man?
Go to hell.
Are we done for today?
Get up.
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
He's an ass that's gonna try.
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
It's so shameful...
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
What's going on?
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
Dewey Newcomb?
Who's askin'?
Huh?
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
Good work today, Ms. Woods.
Sit down.
Thank you.
You're hitting on me?
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
So everything you just said --
You're not going up there.
What did you see when you entered the house?
Was she carrying a weapon?
Why didn't you call me?
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03.
I think so...
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
You ready?
God, that felt great!
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
Licensed attorney or family member?
Uh -- family.
Relation?
I'm her sister.
Name?
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
Our group is full.
I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique.
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
It's not my alibi to tell --
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
I'm a bitch.
We still love you. Sisters forever!
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
Here. You're gonna need this.
Power yoga?
Picking out my wedding dress!
What?!
Josh proposed!
Hello! You're like, a lawyer.
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
Good luck.
Don't ask.
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
Aside from that.
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
And you know this for a fact?
In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
Projecting joy is not my job.
You really think I'm attractive?
He's gay! Enrique is gay!
Back up. How do you know he's gay?
Hey --
Oh, my God!
Up for a celebration dinner?
Someone missed you.
Is he the only one?
No -- it's just -- not me.
I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
Oh, he is so over on this campus.
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
I got bangs!
I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.
Neither.
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
I don't know --
His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
You don't really believe she's innocent?
Class schedule, map, book list.
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
Your what?
You're beautiful.
Then what? My boobs are too big?
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
No, silly. I go here.
You go where?
Harvard. Law school.
You got into Harvard Law?
Good. Good.
Wow. You're a walking felony.
Thank you. Having fun?
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
You look -- nice.
Pink ones.
In court. On opposing sides.
Are you serious?
Yes.
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
Three months.
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
Why do you say that?
Elle?
Is it a Kappa?
There he is!
Why so few?
Then we smash 'em?
You go?  Not watch fun?
Dumb magic.  Giant smash peewee.
We watch... good fun...
You go to lady now?
My generosity is not so large as that.
What do you want with me?
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
But I'm hideous!
You're magnificent.
God protect me.
Not from me, surely...
I am afraid of nothing.
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
Why have you brought me here?
To be my bride, of course.
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
What do you want from me?
And then?
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
I didn't know... I --
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
Flozen foleva not good.
You come stealee tleasoo?
Faerie ring?
It's bluebells!
Damnation!  Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters!  You've bested me, Jack.
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
You be our guest, Jack.
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.
Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
But... but, why?
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
And who might that be?
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.
What is it?
Pregnant, is she?
Damn them!
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
We must follow that bird.
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
Twould appear other travelers precede us.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
My God!  Look!
Something the matter?
Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
I should hope not!
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
What make ye of that, Jack?
Wait!
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
Wait, Jack.
Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.
Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
Can we trust him?
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
That be so, better you pinch yourself now, Jack.
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
There isn't much time!
Been telling you that all along, lad.
One more turn...
Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
Aye.  We're good as inside.
It doesn't matter.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
Sunlight, you say?
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Mean you to seek him out below?
Will you explain what's going on?
Don't get too far!
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
He'll not escape me.
A good day for singing...
I've not heard a note out of you.
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
I was with the Princess.
By the pond.  She was teasing me.
Barely living, from the looks of it.
We seek to undo the curse.
Well done, lad.
Look at that shot!  Three at once! I can't miss!
Sweet slippers of Oisin!
How're these?
Dolt!
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
These for me?
You promised!
Never.
But you did... you did!
I may have said perhaps...
Liar!
Blackheart.  Aptly named.
A promise is a sacred oath.
Stop complaining.
What shall we do?
Oh, dear.
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
How much longer?
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
Are you honest?
He'll not flee if I show myself?
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
Where are you going?
Who?
My own father...
He did run?
I don't want it on me.
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
My lady mocks me.
Tis not fit for a princess.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
I have no wife.
Then, perchance you'll me.
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
Lili!  No!
What have I done?
I thought you were dead... I --
I was bewitched... it's better this way...
No!  I won't let it happen...
What?
Sunlight... It destroys him.
That's why he goes masked during the day...
So, he's hiding in the dark...
In the dark... where I join him...
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
Lili... I love you!
What's the matter?
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
Biting you?
Pinching me!
Pinching?  Where?
Everywhere!  Ow!
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
Step lively now!
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
What became of the princess?
Is she fair, this princess?
Exceeding fair.
She's dead!
No!
Dead, dead, dead.
Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.
Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
Only that?
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
Do I not please you, Jack?
In every way.
And am I not fair?
That was in jest.
Jest with me then.
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
You... you... you mortal you!
What do we do now?
Praise be to God.
Where?
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
What care the bones when the soul is free?
Sorry, Jack.
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
You're with us in battle.
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...
Plenty treasure inside... Jimmy seen it once.
You've been inside?
What are you doing?
Are you going to see Sam again?
He's not there.
He's here.  Check the bathroom.
What's that for?
Mom said I should.
Oh.
He hasn't called?
Do you guys feel like painting?
What color?
Mom?
I couldn't get it to go down.
And why was the alarm on?
You'd better call and cancel.
What are you doing up so early?
Why?  What do you mean?
Atonement.
Sorry I got you into trouble.
He must.
Are you his friend?
No.
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
You're a good girl.
You have to ask like that?
My mother would die.
It's not what I was expecting.
What did you think it would be?
Hey.
Where to?
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
Where's your dad?
He's a freak.
You look better without make-up.
I'll get your back.
Why?
I can use your mom's.
Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
I don't want you to!
We're not gonna do anything.
Why are you so stupid?
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
What are you talking about?
Josh said...
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
I thought I was helping you.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
On the handlebars or your shoulders?
You'd hate him for the trick.
Where are you?!
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
He's at work while I'm here.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
He won't leave my room.
Will he talk to me?
And of course the Beck's, with the...
It could have been a squirt gun.
Are you guys' friends?
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
Mr. Stevens?
A violation?
And if I enclosed it?
A sink?
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
That would take weeks.
I'm good, thanks.
What are you on?
Pardon me?
how much weight have you lost?
Right...she married...what was he?
He buys and sells the world.
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
Maybe that's too long.
Maybe...?
Oh.
How old are you?
Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you were there.
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
Well, I feel better about this now.
I've got one favor to ask.
Well, it's the least I can do.
Is Alyssa home?
She's out with a friend.
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
She didn't really say.
Sam?
Uh huh.
I didn't recognize you!
Thanks for the shower.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
Thank you.
You're here early today.
Is Alyssa here?
This has got to stop!
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
George, this is the third time.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
I forgot where I put my keys.
The whole summer, man.  Party in Tahoe.
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
To check up on me?
I'll be around to check up on you.
Why would you be there?
Because I live there.
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
I'm not going!
I'm not going!
You don't have a choice.
Are you totally insane?!
Probably in the bible.
What are you doing?!
I hate turkey.
Why?
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
You'll have money when you work.
No one would blame me if I left!
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
I'm not doing it!
I'm leaving.
Where are you going?
I don't know.
When are you going to be back?
I don't know.
A friend of yours is here.
Did you got through my pants?
You're too fucking late.
The gloves on the table are for you.
You can't make me do a thing.
Sit down for a second.
Hi, Alyssa.
I took some of your Vicodin.
I know the feeling.
How do you become something you're not?
What would you like to be?
What I'm not.
What are you now?
Nothing.
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
I know parts of who you are.
I wish you had told me then.
I'm telling you now.
What would you be doing now?
Getting high, I guess.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
Sun glasses?
I loved him too much.
After everything.
She seemed upset.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
And you told Mom today?
I don't wanna go, Sam.
I'd eat a lot of red meat.
What would you do?
What kind of house?
Can you build a house in four months?
Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty.
Thanks for telling me.
Ah!  Oh....
It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
I need you to do me a favor.
Oh.  Sorry.
She needs to be alone, I think.
Because Dad left?
She's a little sad, is all.
You should lock your doors.
Lock the door behind you.
Where is he?
What are you doing?
I called everyone, everywhere!  You just vanished!  You could be dead!
Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today.
A blueprint spool.
Where have you been for a week?!
Four days.  I left to think.
What did you do with your dog?
Kurt's been feeding him.
I need to talk to you.
Why would they tow your truck?
I was parked in day parking.
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
I love those doors.
Where will you live?
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
One of you would end up dead.
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
I want him with me.
Hey, hey!
I don't have a phone.
I drove over and you were gone.
Last time you were gone for a week!
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
No.  I was going to let you do that.
I did say he could go.
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
It makes me sad.
What?
But you hated four out of the five you did.
Which?
It's not breakfast yet.
I dreamed about your house last night.
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
Go in there and lick his attitude.
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
With your hands or your tongue?
I'll find something that won't kill them.
Do you need help?
It's been a while.
I smiled at him.
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
I thought we were helping.
That was the truth.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
You bit my finger.
Let's not do this, okay?
Is your back still killing you?
No.  Mostly me.
Peter left me yesterday.
Back.  Neck.  Back.
I could die.
Are you going to kiss me?
I better get the kids home.
Been thinking?
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
Does Alyssa know?
Nothing.
You got any weed?
What's your deal with Alyssa?
Don't even...I'm there.
It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
His father is a man.
We've eaten.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
Should I?
If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
To shave your chest?
The biggest waste of time since television.
I can't go right now.
I was talking about our marriage.
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
Despite you.
I never asked for more.
That's the problem.
Where are the kids?
Sam took them to a movie.
No.
You don't look like you.
Hey.
Hey.
I've missed you guys.
What are you doing in my room?
Can you stay for dinner?
The door was open.
I don't know what I'm doing.
You're sure about this?
You could keep it and rent it out?
Queer.
What did you say?
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
Adam, that's not true!
Nothing R, okay?
Go tell your father we're eating.
Dad's home, already?
Nagger?
No, nigger.
Nigger.
A night in the hole?
Is Mae Rose okay?
She's doing just fine.
And the baby?
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
I'm talking about a haircut.
It's 1945. It's a different world now.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
Is Spanky here?
No, but...
She's alright, isn't she?
Why not?
She got married last month.
She always said that if you were on the outside...
Take care of me?
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.
You know I trust you, Claude.
Yes, sir.
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.
Sure, boss.
Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks!
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?
Come on, honey, let's get out of here.
I've never seen you in here before.
That's because I've never been here before.
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
You went to Monroe?
Where they taking us, anyway?
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
What?
How would I get a loan, anyway?
You need collateral.
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
My daddy gave me this watch.
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
You're soft.
Alright. You want some pie?
Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?
Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.
Here I am.
So you made a generous contribution.
You lost all our money in a card game?
I think he's hurt pretty bad.
It ain't here.
Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
So?
What does that mean?
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
What's up, Ray?
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
You still got that map?
What'd you say?
You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
Come on, Ray, time to go!
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
The hell you talking about? What train?
I don't know. Who do you want?
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
Crawfords.
It's a pardon from the governor.
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
Well, if that's the way it is...
That's the way it is.
You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
What the hell are you doing?
Damn, it was getting hot in there.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
Go where, Ray?
No, I'm gonna kill him --
I can't do it.
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
What'd you say?
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
I can't eat this.
You didn't get ketchup?
Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?
Yeah? You and what army?
I know you're not talking to me...
How you doin'?
I'm all right.
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
You got your own nightclub?
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
Made just for you, Cookie.
How about some steak sauce?
Why ain't his pick swinging?
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
All in, boss!
Move it out.
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
Where am I at, man?
Hey, the dude's holdin'.
Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story.  Nigger, you crying?
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
Just like Elvis.
Mama?
Is everyone here?
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
Wait for the firemen!
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
Lemonade?
If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.
He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
Something like that, yes.
I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.
Apparently, your sister died.
Jenny?
Who?
What's your name?
Me? Willie Long.
What are you in for, Willie?
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
How you doing? We're looking for Slim.
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
ADRIAN!
You shouldn't have come here.
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Let her go.
Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
And he's dead serious.
Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
That's what I thought!
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
We could create our own hell there.
...their damned souls will be ours.
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
Hello, Cassius.
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
No!
It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
And give you a good buzz.
Urr... uggg... errr...
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
My mom wasn't a goat?
Try an angel.
How come you're not older?
Valerie's crying!
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
Did you just talk?
Where is he? He's late.
It's not me, moron.
Makin' friends already.
So far, so good. Now what?
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
I didn't murder anybody
This is baloney!
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
Knock, knock.
Check one-two. Check one-two.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
You're a good devil, Dad.
This is bad, Nicky.
So go get 'em, Dad!
No. This can't be happening.
Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
Coulda been much worse.
Hey.
That's a pretty brassiere.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Bus?
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
Easy, Liberace.
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
What's with that guy?
Should we wake him up?
Look who's back from the dead.
You sure you're down with this?
Looking for the chief.
Which way did he go?
Come on. One more time.
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
Yes, great movie...
Please. You got to.
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
Good idea... kill me.
You gotta kill yourself.
Hello.
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
Adrian?
The South.
My dad's an optometrist.
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
"Octopus people?"
Sometimes, sure.
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
Valerie?
No.
What are you doing?
I think I'm floating.
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
We're going to Jersey?
Don't do it.
Nicky!
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
Do me.
I love you.
Why is that funny?
I don't know.
A black guy?
A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
See something you like, my man?
You callin' me a thief, my man?
Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
All right -- what are you?
How do you think we got here??!!
Where do you think we came from?
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
Where do you send them?
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
That's better.  How do you want us?
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
How do you want us?
I am.
Had enough?
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
Why?
You missed something special.
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
Who invited you?
I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
What the hell took you so long?
Did you?
Of course.
I'm fine...  See you...
What's going on, Logan?!
It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
What's your name?
I'm Mary 2.
Where do you live, Mary?
Here.
Why aren't you in Nursery?
I'm very smart.
When do you go up?
What's wrong, Available?
No.  Just no.
You prefer women?
No.
Yes... probably he was renewed?
He was killed.
Killed? Why do you use that word?
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
Jessica.
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
Later.
But you put yourself on the circuit!
And?
I changed my mind.
Curious.
About what?
Not about that.
I'm listening.
I'm afraid to tell you.
I'm not armed.  Well?
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
Are you a 5 or a 6? 
You could have called me yourself.
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
Maybe... sure...
Thanks... but I have the choice.
Of course.
Why show me?
I'm going to run.
Why tell me?
You know something.
About running, dying what?
It's different now. Help me.
Where did you get that?
A Runner gave it to me.
I let him go... believe me.
Please? What friends?
I don't have much time.
Are you here to help me?
What're you going to do?
That's tomorrow.
I wish I could help you.
Maybe you'll think of something...
Of course --
If you trusted me, you'd know.
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
I'd rather be with you.
Some people say children need human mothering.
Uh-uh.
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
Will you take me with you?
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
I hate outside! I hate it!
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
I doubt it.
Don't ever let go.
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
What does it mean?
You know, Jessica.
...But I still have the choice...?
Of course.
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
There's a Sanctuary... there is!
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
We can't. We're going back.
Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
Beloved husband...
Yes...
Are you sure?
What kind of jewel is this?
What belongs to the people?
What people?
We'll have to bury him.
I'll make the arrangements.
Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...
Come with us.
Goodbye.
Hello, Sandman.
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
How long have you been living here?
For as long as I can remember.
What kind of place is this?
How did you get here?
I have always been here...
Are there any other humans?
But there may be a few around somewhere.
What makes you think so?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Where are they?
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.
Not yet.
Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?
Stay? They lived together all their years?
Yes...
Can you make it back?
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
Well? How do you like it?
No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
You're not contagious are you?
I don't think so.
Just goin' up'ta "Tops"... Maybe the "Ten Pin".
Sheila'll be at "Tops".
Sure, what's wrong with that?
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
You want somethin'?
What's happenin'?
They're comin' with us.
You okay, man?
Pete... You okay?
I'm, okay... You okay?
I like to remember things my own way.
What do you mean by that?
Very strange.
Do you own a video camera?
No.
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Might be a good time to try using it again.
As best we can.
His or ours?
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
You know what I think?
I was here yesterday.
I don't know.
I want more.
Me, too.
Hello.
It's me...
Hi.
I can't see you tonight.
Pete?
Me, too.
He'll kill us.
Are you positive he knows?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
So what do we do?
I don't know.
We should stop seeing each other.
Have you partied with him?
What deal?
He works for Mr. Eddy.
What's he do?
Pete... Don't...
So, should I call Andy?
Why are ya goin' so early?
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
You got him.
You all right?
We killed him.
You killed him.
Where's the bathroom?
Dick Laurent?
Yes, I believe so.
Hey.
Sit down a minute.
What's up?
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
The police called us.
Never saw him before in my life.
Please tell me.
His condition? What do you mean?
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
Where's Pete?
Out in back.
You talk to him?
We saw you that night, Pete.
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
Where is he now?
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
One of the guards must have leaked it.
You just gonna let him go?
That's not Fred Madison?
No, sir, it's not.
Who is it?
When he went to work, right.
What about yesterday?
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
Do you remember?
What's the matter?
Who is it?
What is this, Rogoff?
He's not Madison?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
What's your axe?
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
Something wrong?
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
At your house. Don't you remember?
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
Where's Alice?
What are you going to do?
I like to laugh, Fred.
That's why I married you.
What's that?
A videotape.
Good book, huh?
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
When you didn't come to the club.
I called, you know.
Called? When?
What's that? Another tape?
Don't you want to watch it?
We've got to call the police.
So?
We will.
What the hell is going on?!
What was that?!!!
Where would you feel safe?
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
Let's go home.
What job?
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
I told you to stay in the car!
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
Give that a try.
You like pornos?
Pornos?
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
It'll be ready.
How ya doin', Pete?
Hello.
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
Mr. Eddy?
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
No. No, I don't.
I missed you.
Yeah?...
What are you guys doin'?
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
You want some company?
Why haven't you called me?
Last time I saw you.
I don't remember... What happened that night?
You still care about me?
What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
You really don't remember?
No... I told you.
It was weird...
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
What do you want?
I don't know.
Why don't you like me?
I was?
I didn't know you cared.
Hey... Sheila.
What's the BITCH'S name?!
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Cable from Gainsford.
All of it?
Two years!?
Fossils.
Fossils, huh?
I'm a paleontologist.
A what?
Well, what do you know about that!
Found in Asia!
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
Okay, brother.
Don't call me brother.
Good morning, Lovey.
I beg your pardon.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
I see.
I see.
That's ridiculous.
Is it?
It certainly is.
Oh, really?
Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?
Yes!
Something tells me this means food. Come on!
Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
I'm thinking.
No kidding?
Yeah. You know.
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
There you are!
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
They were in a quandary, and
Well, that's that, I guess.
What are we going to do?
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Chalmers Bryant!
Hey, what's happened to you?
Nothing. Why?
Cave, eh? Where?
Hey - look!
And mine's Conway.
Goodness, no!
Who, for instance?
For a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.
There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.
Oh, good heavens, no!
They were.
108 and still active?
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Shall we have another?
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?
Oh, immediately.
Then it's done.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
Are you so certain you are away from it?
Are you taking me?
Are you the High Lama?
It's astonishing - and incredible, but
Yes.
The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.
Just what I needed too.
Do try to sleep, Bob.
What are these people?
He's dead.
What is it?
See that spot?
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
What are you talking about?
Did I say "if"?
That's what you said.
Nothing about the porters yet?
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
George, what do you think you're doing?
George, come back!
Let me up! Let me up!
What about the porters?
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
You can't leave, George.
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
Maria?
Yes, the little Russian girl.
What's she got to do with it?
Yes.
The clothes?
Yes, everything!
What was that?
Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
Where did you come from?
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
Good.
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
I guess we're in for it.
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
My name's Sondra.
Was this your idea?
I saw a man whose life was empty.
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
I'd love it!
Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
What do you want him to do?
Why, he's speaking English.
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
You'll wait till you rot!
EXCUSE ME
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
All right, I'll be there.
The hell happened?
You shot an eight year old girl.
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
...touch that.
What the hell...
I guess I lost:
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
And Goodwill Toward Man?
No. just peace on Earth.
Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
Only the damn guy won't know it.
All the time, sir.
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
Grab the coffee, will ya?  I told Zed I'd give him a buzz.
We'll take it from here.
What?  Who the hell are you?
Vayanse. You others, go on.
It's a bug.
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
I know, but we're on a college campus...
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
I taught kindergarten.
Ha ha.  No, really.
You don't know me at all.
Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
Something's wrong here.
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
And what's this ... ?
Looks like a train ticket.
You think that's what's-happening?
Jesus...
Jesus Christ...
Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
"Perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs..."
Oh, yeah?  Fill us in, why don't you.
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
It's marble.
Would you call this a code 100?
Do his job.
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
in case I need it?
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!
You were saying?
After I got the shit beat out of me!
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
You coulda told me what you were doing.
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
I'm just wondering what's so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it?
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
Why not?
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
What do we do?
What do we do?    Lean into it.
What the hell does that mean?
What are you doing?
The kid looked desperate.  I figured...
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown.
Noon exactly.
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
He's gone, too.
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
They're gone.
I'm getting a trajectory...
And they're buying it?
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
Did it leave?
Actually, I don't know...
Wally!
What?
They're inside.
Take it.
Drop some money.
Forget that guy --
No.  Follow him.
He'll turn around.
Agatha...
He's here.
Oh, God...
Where are we going?
Someplace safe.
Agatha, you're never going back there.
Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
She died?
What --
-- but he didn't.
Then who was he?
Just some guy... they found.
Found?  Where?
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
And replace them with new ones.
That's not much.
You don't remember me, do you?
We know each other?
I put you away --
Yes, you did.
You made those tapes...
They were performance pieces.
How do I find the --
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
Hence the expression...
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
Tell me not to worry, John.
Don't worry, Lamar.
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
I understand.  What's the other thing?
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
Lara called me.
I go running down there.
Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
Somebody named Leo Crow.
All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
John.  Please.  Listen to me --
I'm not getting halo'd.
You can't run --
People want to believe in the system.  That's the beauty of it...
Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
You don't have to do this, Chief.
We can't grab it...
Somewhere near the capital?
No maglev system.
The mall?
Yeah?  So?
Go ahead.
Uh-huh.  Jad?
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
Confirm with trig and image.
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
Why did you catch that?
Because it was going to fall.
You're certain?
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
To them.
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
If it's a question of authority.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
But you call this room the "temple".
I need help with her.
Rufus.  She's a precog.
She's a precog?
Are you reading my mind right now?
They don't belong to anybody.
Stop --
What happened?  Where's the rest?
Rufus, play it back...
I scored a goal!
Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you, Sean.
Come on!
Sean -- you're not real.
It's a little late for that.
You're alive?
No.  He got tired of pretending.
I wanted to.
Who are you?
I'm your son.  I'm you.
Sean, wait...
Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
You're not gonna kill me?
But you have to.  They said you would.
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
Who made you do this?
Kill me!
You're not gonna kill me...
Something wrong?
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
Not if I stay away from him.
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
The system would collapse.
I believe in that system...
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
Hold that thought.
What safe place is that?
If... you have one.
How do I even know which one has it?
Which one is that?
John?
He's dead, Lara.
Oh, God, what did you do?
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
It's insanity around here.
We know why John was tagged.
The guy from USA Today is here.
Tell him not now.
Sir, the press conference is starting.
Congratulations, sir.
You have an emergency call on your private line.
He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
Lamar, I found something.
Good God.  What was that?
It's the same prevision.
Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
This is Evanna, the team pilot.
Can't they shut that off?
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
He's trying to prove his innocence.
There a maid in this hotel?
What kind of cop were you before this?
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
How many?
He looks familiar.
What about your meeting?
Raincheck?
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
This your work?
I like it.
Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
Cream and sugar.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
We used to, every summer.
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
So you haven't seen his apartment?
That was our apartment.
Since right after we lost our son.
You mean after he lost your son.
It was nobody's fault.
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
You know I need to use you.
Nice to meet you, Wally.
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
You're Bobby, right?
No thank you.
You sure? I just made it.
Snifter are for warm drinks --
We have snifters
Now, Mr. Slade, you're in room 315.
Yes, sir.
Is it a good room?
Not on me, sir.
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Are you sure?
Yeah. Take it.
Thank you very much, sir.
What, sir?
Is it the good room?
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
Thank you, sir.
Where's the place to go tonight?
As far as...?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
So, wait, you're from where?
We're in Fashion.
He's okay.
Should I fuck him?
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
He's great, right. Is he great?
He's alright.
Oh no. What is it this time.
We used to take baths together.
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
Nobody's fuckin talking to you.
Ricky's not wearing one.
A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
She's, uh, sleeping.
Hello.
Chloe?
I don't know.
Mommy's not home?
No.
Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
Honey?
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
No. What kind of bachelor party?
Oh my god. What happened?
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
You talk to Max today?
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
I feel weird asking him.
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
Yeah? You sure?
I'll support you.
With what?
She needs a family. A dad. I'll give her what you never had.
I never promised you anything.
Whu --
There's no touching.
Get your hands off of her.
I -- I -- I... Don't...
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
Draw.
What's your record at?
What's up? Jess ready?
You driving her?
C'mon girl. Eat up.
Get away from her.
What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz?
When's it going down?
No.
Brooklyn.
He must have that shit troughed.
Where we going?
Quick drop. In and out.
Where's Ricky?
Ricky's taken care of.
That it?
This is it.
You like the ponies?
Sure. Yeah.
You bet the ponies?
Pshhh...
A million. Easy.
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
I'll work it off.
Not driving Jess, you won't.
So, that's it. I'm out?
I didn't say that.
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
You told him you liked him.
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
Yes.
What is it?
There won't be a next thing.
What's the plan?
You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
Nah.
Where is the Soho Grand?
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
You don't know where you're going?
No. Just the cross streets.
I can wait around if you want.
Spa?
Yeah.
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
Yeah?
Understand me?
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
Ricky's taken care of.
Taken care of?
Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
I'm on the phone.
Listen, man, we really gotta...
We're with Ruiz.
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
Can you check?
Sorry, man, but...
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
Any time, bro.
Did Max mention anything about any jobs?
What about boxing?
What about it?
So?
So, it was a draw.
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
So, it's not a winning record.
Don't be shitty.
How am I being shitty?
I'll page you.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
I got no idea.
I will.
I thought you hate that club.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
Fuck them.
We need guns.
I think we might.
He didn't say we need guns.
You wanna go right now?
Sorry coach.
We look good this year.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
I like it.
It's not even yours.
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
What? Did she say something?
Who's driving her?
Right here's fine.
It's ours.
Holy shit. Can you believe this?
What's the movie?
I'll get the girl.
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
Maybe we should call for a cab.
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
Who you calling?
Shhh... Hello, room service?
How much was it?
Forty-six.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Yeah, I guess.
Great. On my fucking room.
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
They didn't say an address?
I told you what they said.
Nothing else.
How'd they know who you were?
They asked who it was.
So they said more than the address.
This is bullshit, man.
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
Sold it, stole it, whatever...
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
What the fuck is that supposed --
I mean, that's what I heard --
You know this guy?
What did I 'get?'
So is this the drop?
Like I said, I don't know.
He woulda told us right?
Yeah.
You happy?
About what?
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
Where do you think you're going?
Back in.
You fucking nuts?
You got that right.
We're getting whacked.
Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
Put that shit out...
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
Nothing, man.
Let's do it.
The what?
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
We need guns.
All the more reason.
It was six in the fucking morning.
You're out of money?
No.
Eighty.
Eighty bucks?!?
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
It's gonna be fine.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
So what do we do?
Let's just go now and wait.
Three and a half hours?
I don't want to take any more chances.
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
No. I'll wait here.
Tom. How's it going?
Fine, fine. And you were...?
Bobby and Ricky.
C'mon...
We rep lines? You know? Fashion?
And you grew up in Manhattan?
Kinda. Yeah.
Where's the surprise?
You want your surprise?
Yeah. I want it.
I want to leave right now.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
What?
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
What's up, man.
A little.
You look good, man.
Cool. See you later.
Yes?
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
How much is what?
Yes?
Drinks are free, right?
Yes.
Where do you live?
Excuse me.
You strapped?
Don't drag my ass into this --
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
See you later.
You really in trouble?
Ow, shit...
And where is...?
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
No shit?
Does anyone want another?
Sure. Anyplace in particular?
What do you want?
A little Charlie, perhaps.
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
No, really, mate?
Here they are, then.
How's it going?
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...
Good morning.
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
Nah, man...
Ricky.
Is it nice?
The Soho Grand?
Yeah.
You're from LA, right?
Yeah.
So you're our own private guy?
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
You know my pager number?
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
A lot of Persians?
I call 'em wiggers.
Sure. You boys want anything?
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
Thanks.
We're going to New York?
Yes. You're going to New York.
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
That money is your per diem.
Keys.
What?
I get it.
Tell me.
Don't worry. I get it.
So tell me how it is.
But, Max --
We're square.
No. I'll take a strega.
Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.
We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
Who's gonna outfit us?
Yeah.
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
Edinburgh.
I'm working trains. Selling.
Bet you like that shit.
Heard where?
Man's rep travels.
Is your papa West Indian?
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
Where can I get a hold of you?
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
Did you just now con me?
Yes, sir.
When?
How's it feel?
I told you less paper, less trouble.
1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1.  I git 'em all?
Daddy, where's my money?
What you talking?
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
You never had it.
Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying.
You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
You know it.
I'll give you back the 600.
I don't want your money.
I'm wearing, Archie.
And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down.
That's what it is. Walk on out.
Let Billie finish.
Take it easy, baby.
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
Man live by his rep.
Yeah, got to do something about you.
Who the hell are you?
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
What did you give it to me for then?
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
Don't con me. Don't try...
Okay, okay.
Don't con me.
That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
Tell Him that.
Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?
Is the program ready?
What?
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
How do you like it?
Let's talk about you for a change.
What have you set your mind to?
I'm in Detroit.
Did you hear what I said?
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
Yes. Did you eat?
It won't be easy.
Just hold me.
It will be rough.
Hush your mouth.
I'll be away a lot.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Because you're in trouble.
Talk about what?
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
We need you too!
Get some sleep.
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
Dear heart, where are you?
I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
Let some of us come down there.
Let's cancel.
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
Why don't you just ask your question?
You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
Just what is your question?
I told you we don't know for certain.
Did you see the papers today?
Can I ask you something?
Sure, man.
Are you Elijah's pimp?
"His greatest greatness."
I say a lot of things.
'Bout every other night, Red.
She know?
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
I better not come in.
I ain't stupid.
I mean it's late, baby.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
Get out.
Your control over your children, therefore --
Did you hear me?!
Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
What does Sidney say?
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
No. You'll be marked for death.
You're my father.
Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
You the man.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
Well, all right, then.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
That's a fine chick.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
You're too small to be Bogart.
Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
That ain't bad.
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
So what about him?
That's right.
Head nigger in charge?
Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?
Who the hell are they?
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
He told you that?
Yes sir.
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
They talked about me like
My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
[Where are you coming from?]
[South America.]
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
[I'm on to Juarez.]
[Why?]
A lot of people are looking for you.
I guess that makes you the smart one.
Where do I find you?
Deal.
[Reina Rosas.]
[What is his name?]
[What's the PIN number?]
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[Who killed her? You?]
[No!]
[Don't lie to me.]
[The boss did or his brother.]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[Do you know who I am?]
[Who are you?]
[The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
[Where do I find him?]
[I believe you.]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[What do you mean?]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[And I had my men ready.]
[Yes. Many times.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
[Maybe your men stole from you.]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
What is it?
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
Is it loaded?
I drink.
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
I'm here.
So what's wrong?
Nothing wrong.
But don't you stay in El Paso?
Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
What are you doing here?
I came to visit you.
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
Where are you from, Creasy?
The United States.
No.
Why not?
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
We're taking a different way home.
Did you like school, Creasy?
No.
Not at all?
No.
And don't start crying.
Pinta, do you have a pencil?
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
Do you think he'll come back?
Maybe. Did you hear him?
How do you think he got out?
Well, I let him go.
It's better to be free, right?
They'll be back in a week.
It hurts.
Where?
Do you always sleep with him?
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
Did you sleep alright?
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
Why do you ask?
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
I don't understand.
Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
No.
Did you used to?
You're late.
Where's my mother?
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
I know you're not.
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
What's so important in Los Angeles?
Could I ask you a question?
Could I stop you?
You don't drink like you used to.
Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
The world of our children. How dare they?
You're American.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
How are you getting along with Pinta?
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
It makes it all seem so serious.
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
Rosanna Guerrero.
It's Creasy.
Last night. Do you know something?
What was her name?
If she pisses you off, you get another one.
[Yes.]
You should be sleeping, baby.
Yes, mom?
I like him, Mom.
Bye, Mom.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
I think it's nice he's American.
Hmm?
What? Who?
That's ridiculous.
I've just been so busy, Lisa.
It will be a hard break.
She's young. She'll get over it.
[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
[You only fuck me to get information.]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
Two tourists who never went home.
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
Hey, Herbie...
So waddaya feel like doing tonight?
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
What makes you say that?
I could see she likes you.
Yeah, sure.
So what do you feel like doing tonight?
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
What for?
It's early.
It must be one o'clock.
All right, I'll see you!
We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.
I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
I told this dog I was gonna call her today about two-thirty.
Hey! What are you doing here?
I feel fine.
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
I don't think I remember him.
That's my son Thomas's baby.
What happen?
When was this?
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
It pains that they should do this.
Marty.
...you teach chemistry? That's funny. Where? What school?
This is the kitchen.
Yes, I know.
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
Please...
No...
Please...
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
You got an elevator in this house?
We just live one flight up.
So I'll call you tomorrow.
Siddown, siddown. You want some chicken? We got some chicken in the ice box.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.
Are you kidding?
I'm just here with another girl.
I'll see you around.
And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
That's the one.
What time is it?
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
You gonna die without a son.
So I'll die without a son.
You not ugly.
Marty...
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
I said, is she Italian girl?
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
Don't bring her to the house no more.
...and they sit down right next to me...
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
That's swell, Missus Fusari.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...
That's all right, that's all right...
On accounta...
Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
Wadda you so sore about?
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
You talked to Walt?
What is, Red, the intention or the act?
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
Yes, O'Reilly?
That's right.
Where?
Hospital.
Which hospital?
Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
Look at that right eye.
Because is not democrash? All peoples created equal?
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
You  must  open  me  up  again?
Wisconsin.
So long, Ho-Jon.
You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
We've stuck it out for a whole week now... Pretty girl.
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
What's that?
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
When will he be able to write?
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
Never heard of him.
Look at the size of those two beasts.
Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
When?
Any time. Whenever we want.
There's no transportation anyway this time of night.
We could steal one of the choppers.
I have a tent to myself.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
We're a good team.
We think the same way.
Ravenous. What about you?
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
Frank...
Wait a second...
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
I was just asking...
But what about Major Houlihan?
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
You betcher ass, Dad.
A-negative. I've cross-matched it.
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
C-A-M-E-M...?
...But I turned in my knee pads.
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
Is he out?
I don't feel anything.
All of them?
That's right. We work well together.
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
The bastards outconned us.
I think we could still have a chance.
See you.
It's possible
Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.
No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
You're an attractive man.
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
But I'm married.
Something else we have in common.
Very happily married.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
Even if I weren't.
I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
Second pint.
I didn't have much choice.
Excuse me, Sergeant.
What do you want with those two medical officers?
They missed the boat.
Thanks.
He's the pro from Dover and I'm the Ghost of Smokey Joe.
He's coming to.
No, never in the slightest.
In the direction you want to go.
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
You can cut the bow.
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
What's going on? Who started this?
You mean who hit who?
Yes, that's what I mean.
O'Reilly!
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Oh, get out of here!
Good morning, Colonel.
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Can you make out what they're talking about?
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
What's that, Henry?
Morning, girls. Good morning Major.
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
How is he?
Nice.
Nice.
Huh?
Are you all right?
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
Action?
Against what?
Against anything. Just protest.
Oh, yuh did, huh?
Hello, John.
Can I help you pack?
Ted Sheldon.
Go ahead, driver! Ball park!
How much money do you get?
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
A third party?
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
The Websters.
That's your father's diary, Ann.
The letter.
What letter?
The letter from John Doe.
There is no letter.
You made it up.
In what man!
John Doe.
John Doe.
Well, you're catching on.
Who, for instance?
Okay, sister, you get your job back.
Plus a bonus.
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
Hurry up, Pop.
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Okay, fellows.
What's the idea?
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
Has he been here?
No.
Have you seen him?
Where's Connell?
He's watching the other door.
Oh, let me go, will you!
Had any schooling?
What do you do when you work?
I used to pitch.
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
Ann! Say, why didn't yuh
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Help yourself.
Who's got him?
The heelots!
The heelots!
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
How could he be a fake? 
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
I gotta figure some way out of this thing!
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
Four bits.
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Join the John Doe Club.
Now, that's all right, isn't it?
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
Go down to the office and arrange for some radio time.
Well, I don't get it.
No.
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
That's got nothing to do with it!
Were you paid for itor weren't you?
What difference does that make?
Did you write itor didn't you?
It's for Ann . . .
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later.
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
That's too bad.
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a
Spencer of the Chronicle .
Out the window! Something just flew by!
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
They're not usually graduate students.
Floor seats.
You're my hero.
Dinner's on you.
Where's the stereo?
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
What's the line?
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
What happened, Mike.
This has nothing to do with Walter.
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
I hate fucking Springfield.
Where's the car?
Am I gettin' the car?
Automatic.
Hold on a second here.
You signed out twice.
Hi, Roper.
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
That's right.
What's the suspect's name?
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
Anything on Korda so far?
Are you in charge, Roper?
Is that all?
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
You ever been in a hostage situation?
Only at the very end.
How do you feel after a shooting.
I've rarely shot anyone.
I know.
So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
Recruited you from where?
Furthest point I could find from New York.
You'd never been out of New York?
How did you like Toronto?
It was okay.
How are we gonna get him out of there?
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
I don't really like to drink.
You have to. It's a tradition.
You got a girlfriend?
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
We see each other every couple of months.
No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
Where did you hear that?
I think I can handle that one.
You think you can learn, McCall?
No.
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
I'm not good at lying.
Get good at it.
You know the ten commandments?
Yes.
What's the first commandment?
You tell me.
Yes.
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
You know why I like the track?
I have two words for you... Seek help.
Ronnie... Yeah, so.
So what do you want?... An autograph.
I'm just practicing my lying.
That's okay. That's his style.
To run last?
The 6 horse is still last.
They need to run first and second?
The jockey!
We won!
We lost.
We won.
How long you been coming here?
Is it always like this?
There's your answer. He's smart.
He's cutting down the visibility.
What the fuck is going on.
You're crazy.
It might have happened no matter who was up there.
And what about the ones you don't save?
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
And what if you can't live with it?
So what do you want to do?
Have you evacuated anyone?
I know how you feel, Ray.
This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
I worship you.
You worship yourself.
Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
I'm not drunk. Yet.
Maybe you should be.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
Scott, You can't save everyone.
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
What do you want from me?
You think I didn't need you?
I wanted to get this out of the way.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
I've been craving that stuff all week.
What do you think?
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
It's okay. We broke up.
You like this place?
Yeah?
Korda escaped.
Stay here, don't move.
Scottie...
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
Hmm?
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
...the hell are you talking about?
You crazy? With all those people around?
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
The hell I am!
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
Roper.
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
What do you think would be in order?
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
The car is part of the deal.
Repoed this morning.
I can't do that.
Who's running it?
Who's running it!
What have you promised them?
Are these yours?
Yeah, they are but...
This is Halden.
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
What do you need?
God-Damn you!
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
It's okay.
Okay...
Why?
How come I can't remember?
As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --
Do you believe in miracles?
You were right.
Who are you?!
It's all here...
The guests are here.
Guests?
But this is impossible.
Wake up?!
No.
Not my problem.
Divinity?
Yes.
You are not a God.
In a computer program.
The new world.
It's not real.
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
Where the hell are you going?
And what about the reconfiguration?
It's his nature.
But what if he doesn't --
How long 'till we can eject?
We're going to have to reconfigure.
How long?
Where you plugged-in from?
What?
What's her name?
Who?
The woman you're stuck on.
Get some internal police there. Tell them to run a perimeter.
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
The only way to eject it is from the inside.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
One condition.
What?
A hotel?
Why?
What did he tell you?
The truth.
Not his style.
Then you had her killed.
Why would I do that?
There was no need to kill her.
Then where is she?
An interface attendant.
Where?
Need the disk back!
Insurance.
What brings you inside?
Cleaning up a mess.
I've got to get back.
Then how do you know about --
-- You told me.
-- The inside?
But I don't know anything about programming.
Why?
It was a test.
Realize?
And it meant something.
What?
I wasn't with you.
I know.
But you were with me.
Not you.  A copy.
I'm sorry.
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
What's so funny?
This.  No point to it.
Why not?
Because you'll never believe me.
It was just there.
Just like that?
Activated.
Program name?
Resurrection.
Destination?
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Connection approved.  Ready to transmit --
Access granted.  Male or female?
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
Standard, modern, upscale --
-- Standard.
Program name?
Connect to public access.
We've got him locked!
He's on us!!
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all?
It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.
What?!
Is this... food!
I heard that!
We've come all this way for a rock wall?!
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION!
SABER TOOTH TIGER!
Let's teach these vermin a few manners.
That's pretty bad.
Release the power WITH the power.
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
... Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers...
I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
What's a Triac?
PTERODACTYL!
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension.
NINJA CRANE ZORD!
That's the only way to the Monolith...
Two thirty three a.m.
THREE DEGREES OFF THE COMETS TRAJECTORY!
Let's go after him!!
I'm in!
IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!
The Stealth Eagle is about to fly.
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
Here you go!  No pushing!
Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
There goes the neighborhood.
It's... an eagle?
Look closer.
And how do we release the power?
Just shut your gap!
I'm outta here.
GET OFF ME!
Simon says...
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
"Basically".
Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
That was a CHEAP shot!
How the heck?!...
NINJA APE ZORD!
You own a hotel, sir?
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
We're asking you to go to prison.
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.
The goddamned bastards.
Poor, yeah.
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
Boo-Boo.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
You scare me, Charlie.
Are you frightened?
I had everything. Once.
So what happened?
I came into this world flat on my ass.
And now you have everything.
I guess I am. Just a little.
What do you mean?
When my money moves, I go with it.
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
Four-twenty-eight.
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
From your mouth ta God's ear.
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
Shane was a friend of yours?
But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
Who hired the bastard?
You ain't even a man yet.
Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
Inside, they were talking of you.
I can just imagine.
No. They envy you.
For being a bootlegger?
You here with Bobby?
What's the matter?
I'm already late.
Luciano.
I was calling yesterday.
Something came up.
I needed to see you again.
Same here.
It's a mask.
You got something to hide?
It's too late.
Have you thought about this?
Why? You're the innocent one.
You could have stopped him.
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
So you all make the same mistakes?
I booked passage to London.
If I look weak now, it's over.
Would it be painful for you?
Charlie?
I'm doin' business here!
Meyer just finished the books.
Meyer.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
You're getting' 10 cc's
You bastards, I said twenty!
It'll just be a few minutes.
Who?
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
Come off it, Bugs.
Come off it, Bugs.
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
I like that.
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
This business is about taking risks.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
He's trying to make it.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
What the fuck does that mean?
Boss, I got all the time you need.
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
You gotta plan these things.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
The kid just called me stupid.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
One move pardner, and you're a dead man.
I must know more of you, my son.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
And how many soldiers do you have?
What about the share.
You get fifteen percent.
I found that out.
We learn from life.
Conditions have changed. Some people have become too powerful.
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
They do what I tell 'em.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
We must be friends, Charlie.
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
Masseria's been after me too.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
Bring order out of chaos. If you lead... they'll follow.
And what do you want out of this?
Shuddup.
Wanna know what I think?
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
Where's the stiff?
Jesus.
Forget it.
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
Maranzano wants you dead.
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
What a cozy little scene.
Kill them! Kill them!
Anything ain't a very hard number.
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
That a Jew compliment?
Take any one ya like.
You're fuckin' crazy.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
Switch hands.
What's the maximum safe dose?
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
Uhh - martini?
Olive or eyeball?
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
Death! Thank you!
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
Bitchin' good cake.
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
Sure. Why?
You're acting kind of...odd.
What are you watching?
You sure this is...medically advisable?
Got a doctor on duty.
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
What's the "bad" part?
Did we just - <u>hit</u> something?
I don't think so.
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
How was it? I don't recall.
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
What's the matter?
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
Don't ask where I got it.
Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
I'm reportin' this to my union!!
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
Where'd he go??
Stu...Stu...
IT'S NOT WORKING.
Stu...LOOK!
What?
You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
I just need to use the phone, lady.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
We like to think so, yeah.
Who told you we deal drugs?
Is there something else I can do for you?
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
So, what do you think?
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
Uh-huh?
... What are they all doing there?
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
How are you doing sweetheart?
I'm good.
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
What pictures?
You know ...  ... whoops!
Behind the books.
I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
He seemed quite taken with you.
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, I hope so, dear.
It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
Who is it?
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night.
What does he do?
Are you sure you got my bag in?
So, you come here all by yourself?
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
I see.  How much?
Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Thanks very much, sonny--
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
I did not--
You've never *seen* this contract.
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
Looks like it, but--
But it *isn't*?
Positively not in the station! Gone!
And while you're at it, get me a bed!
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
Would you settle for a husband?
Huh?
Oh--that again. Yeah.
You got worms.
Will you go chase an ambulance!
Kid--wait--what do you think you're going to do?
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute.
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
What do I play?
You play--left field.
Did you like the first act?
Yeah. What about the second act?
What dame?
Paine.
Why do I always laugh at that?
"There's more light here," he says--
Drunks are funny--
Yeah. Funny--
Yeah. Some of my best friends are funny.
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
*I'm* just waiting for a street car--
Again? Good idea.
Diz--
Yeah.
Good idea. When?
Any time.
Tonight?
Okay. You don't mind?
Have *you*?
No.
Do we *have* to?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
Well, let's get going.
Where?
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
What?
My first name's--Clarissa.
Yeah, I know. That's okay.
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
Huh?
You know, we're getting married.
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
Yes, Joe, yes--right away. 
What is it?
Sam Foley--dead!
No wonder--without your dinner.
Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
How do you feel, champ?
One minute! Just one minute!
They put up *their* candidate? Who?
I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--
Jim, that bunch is out for blood. If I throw Horace in their teeth now--
I *won't* send Horace Miller!
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
*But you never asked me*!
Y-yes, Jim.
Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
I did. What about it?
Than what?
Jeff for Senator.
I *thought* I heard... Yes?
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Yes. Come in.
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
The porter's got them. They're coming.
Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
Look! There it is!
H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
He's a newspaper publisher I know-- and--
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
Mr. President!
Will the Senator yield?
Well, it isn't much, but if you insist, here's this week's. 
Here--where are you running off to?
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
Well--goodnight.
Goodnight, Jeff.
Yield *how*, sir?
Will he yield for a question?
Ah, now, that's better.
Will he *yield*?
Mr. President! A point of order!
Please, sir!--come with me!
Oh, now--
Jefferson--
Now, Amos, now--  What?
Certainly would, Joseph.
How's Amos, Ma?
Just fine.
You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
What is it?
Office of--Senator Smith?
The man downstairs said number--
What's your name?
There *what* was?
Whose statue is that?
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
No, gee--I couldn't stay here--
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
Oh, but this one is so simple.
I see. *This* one is so simple--
Oh, just a day--
A *day*!
Committee, huh?
Committee.
Yes, I see that.
What's that?
What?
The Steering Committee.
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
No! Go right ahead, Miss Saunders.
Thanks very much.
Well--gosh--that--that isn't "particulars," is it?
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
You mean--here?
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
Have you always had to--work?
Since sixteen or so.
It hasn't been easy, has it?
I also answer to whistles.
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
I know. It's--Violet.
It *is* not!
Abigail.
No!
Letitia.
No!
Lena.
No! Stop it!
I've got more. You better tell me.
You win. It's--Clarissa.
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
Must have been tickled pink.
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Thanks a lot.
Hello.
What you *have* to do is fight!
Yay!
Where do we go from here?
Whoa! Hold it! Pipe down! Come on, now--that's enough of that.
Oh--you are!
Then you *did* say it.
Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
I'm splendid, too.
That's--that's splendid.
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
One moment, friends, let's give the Senator a break.  Now, where'd you say you studied law?
Well! Hear anything? Any sign of him?
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
What do you mean? What's going on?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!
Joe--drop everything and come with me!
Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
That's right.
Why don't you do it yourself?
He's lost complete faith in me--
Well--me, too!
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Jim, I won't stand for it.
You won't stand for it?
Jeff--this is Mr. Taylor.
Jim!
Just a minute, Joe!
It's crucifying him--!
Anything *better* to offer?
Maybe he won't get up.
Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!
Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!
His first 'whiff'!
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Do I actually *see* this--?
Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
Mr. President...
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
Will the Senator yield?
That's going to be fun.
Good morning.
Deeds?
Since he was born.
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
Pixilated.
Sometimes he whistles.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
He sure is pixilated.
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
Oh, yes.
He's still pixilated.
Are you married?
Yes, sir.
Any children?
Thank you very much.
No. Are you?
I haven't.
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
Yes!
Are these the articles?
Yes!
Are they true!
NO!!
But they did take place?
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
And you saw them happen?
That's all, Miss Bennett.
It isn't all! I'd like to explain
What's that got to do with it?
What's that got to do with it?
You are , aren't you?
You fainted.
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
What?
Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
Sure. I met you.
What did they say?
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
What are they going to do?
Have you seen the papers?
Yes.
I say, to most people it's a washout.
That depends on what they see.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
Here's a nice place.
Oh, that
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
I've often thought about going back.
He played in the town band, too.
He did? I play the tuba
Yeah, I know.
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
I didn't think you could come with the party and everything.
Yes, if it isn't too late.
Mary, I'm going home.
Are you? When?
In a day or so, I think.
Well, here we are again.
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
What's the matter, hon?
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
Uh-huh.
People have been crucified before.
Why? Why do we have to do it?
Yeah, then what?
You're a fool, Babe.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
Just a minute. No, you don't.
Can I have a month's vacation?
With pay!
With pay!
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
Did it?
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
How'd you get the picture?
What's bothering you, huh?
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That"
What're you going to do?
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
That's the rub.
I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
Come on, come on!
Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.
Ow! My foot's asleep!
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Who? Miss Dawson?
You try it.
How's it going? Okay?
Gold, eh?
Yes, sir.
Fourteen carat?
Is that the best you've got?
Sit over there, will you?
Me sir?
How is this, sir?
Perfect! Perfect!
You can't come up here!
Let me go! I wanna see him!
He's not home, I tell you!
I wanna see that guy!
We'll send for the police!
Relatives of old man Semple.
Miss Bennett please!
It's a lie!
But your honor
I can't find him.
Look!
What?
Where?
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
Yes.
How do you do.
Yes.
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
Will you have a cigar?
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
Nah.
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
Have a drink?
Uh-huh.
That's funny. Why is that?
What're you talking about?
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
Arthur wants to quit!
Oh, they insisted on following me.
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
Sometimes it's the only solution.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit.
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
Why, it's an artistic institution
Me?!
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
my wife wanted me to tell you she  she prays for you every night.
What kind of wife did you say she was?
A child? My uncle's?
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
No, I mean - about my client.
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
No - I don't want it, thank you.
Proceed.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I write poetry.
Brookfield just came in.
Who are they?
What is your name?
Christian Svenson.
Farmer?
Yes, ma'am.
South Dakota north.
South Dakota - north?
Is she home?
Yeah. What?
You mean  by the neck or something?
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
What do you think you're doing?
No, sir.
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
You're Walter, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
What's that?
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
You came home last night - without them.
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
Why, that's an echo, sir!
You try it.
Me, sir?
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
Me more than most.
Why are they ganging up against me?
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
You can go out there if you like...
Dr. Mumford.
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
I'm fine.
You're the shrink, aren't you?
No, not really.
What an asshole!
Ernest, what do you think?
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
You do seem much more disposed toward him than I understand, Ernest. Did I miss something?
What are you doing for lunch?
I have eighteen more minutes!
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
What?
Stop now.
Why? I'm paying for this.
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
Go to hell.
I was... never satisfied.
What's that?
What is it?
It's a thought I had.
What exactly is it supposed to do?
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
What do you do?
Althea hasn't told you?
You're the doctor, what do you think?
I'm sorry, your honor.
What?
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
I'd better get in there.
That's a lot of people all at once.
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
You do?
Yeah.
You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
My patient had to leave early.
I think it's like... inquisitive.
What do you want to know?
How long you been in this town?
So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?
You like me. How come?
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
And the Brocketts?
Where am I supposed to eat?
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
...so rich?
Doc...
Lily.
You would have met in some shower eventually...
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
-- you crazy? You can't do this!
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
Got a license?  But no car?
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
That would explain it.
Can you help Mom?
I'm trying.
What's wrong with her?
Hiya, Doc.
Martin.
What's happening here?
We're going for a walk.
Ph.D., psychologist.
Oh... not a real doctor.
Finally, some common sense...
What do you mean?
No, I really don't.
Wow. You're something.
Well, look who's here...
Just who is here, can you tell me?
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
I don't know. I barely made it today.
We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
I'm not making any promises.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
Is she against you getting help?
We don't discuss it.
Please... forgive me.
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
I've offended you!
No.
Is this the treatment?
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Where?
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
I can give myself a headache instantly.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
So whose route is this?
You like it?
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
That's what I like.
Which thing?
My brother said you were about to fire me.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
Transference!
Hello?
I guess you saw the show...?
Which show was that?
...How violated I feel?
I am irate!
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
What?
You got off easy.
Will you wait for me?
We're only talking about six weeks.
What do you mean, "in no time"?
In maybe three or four issues.
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
What happened today?
What are you talking about?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
What'd he say?
You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.
Would you like another beer?
Can I ask you a personal question?
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
This is great!
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
What?
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
Guess.  Go ahead, guess!
Slash what?
How's it coming?
Really?
Who else knows?
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
I've told you a lot of private stuff.
I can tell you anything else.
But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
Everybody has a story, Skip.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
It wasn't the best situation.
"Get to know your therapist."
You were messed up, man.
Things got a lot worse.
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
Psych major?
Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
Sorry...
I guess that makes sense.
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
You know where he's taking her?
Who the hell are these guys?
I never killed a priest before.
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
And how does one do that?
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
Oh yes, of course.
If he arrives before us, it will be too late.
None of the above, thank you.
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
Why do you like to fight so much?
Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
Where's your new friend?
Immune from what?
Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
Yeah?
Intestines.
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
You will not believe it.
So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
The sun turning black.
You bastards!
The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
Where are they taking him?
No women allowed.
I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
Two hundred pounds.
Proceed!
You lie.
Fifty percent.
Twenty.
So who's the broad?
No.
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
I just decked your brother
Yeah, I was there.
You swear?
Every damn day.
What did you find? What did you see?
Yes.
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
We're almost there.
That "thing" gets me excited.
What are those mirrors for?
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
Preparation for what?
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
You two!
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
No you're not.
I'm not?
Not unless you call me Rick.
Why would I do that?
You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him.
Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
Got it!
Don't do it, Evelyn.
Jonathan?
Yes?
I was mistaken.
I'm your sister.
That just makes you more gullible.
But he's just a filthy criminal?
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
What do you suppose killed him?
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
I found it, Evy! I found it
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
Finish the inscription, idiot!
Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!
Hey,... don't I know you?
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
That thing gives me the creeps.
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
Who's here!?
What?
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!
I know you did.
I knew you'd know.
I know you knew I'd know.
And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
Um-hmm.
Except for one little thing.
Everything's going exactly as we planned.
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
It must have slipped my mind.
Where are you going?
I thought you were done?
Our guests are waiting.
You two timing psychotic bastard.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
So who killed him?
We didn't think this through very well.
When was that?
We could really use some coffee --
Come on, baby!
Atta, girl!
Hey, do I look like a Man?
Who are you?
And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
How about... the Savage Six?
But you're a superhero.
It's late. I'm headin' home.
Sounds good to me.
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
What did he mean?
Mon Captain, it's for you. 
Hey... you okay?
Yes!
Doctor Heller?
Yes!
Thanks.
How's your dad?
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
Snap out of it!
He'll never make it.
I got it.
Superheroes.
That boy's got talent.
They always call the great ones nuts.
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Against.
You're dead.
And the light goes out...
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
Are you an actress?
Just a waitress.
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
Who's the artist?
Come here.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Then why are you here?
Curiosity.
I'd better go.
Who?
Stay away!
I guess... Are you always so angry?
Or talk?
Hi.
Alone tonight?
Date?
Sure.
I admire you.
I wouldn't mind being famous.
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
What's your real name?
Roy.
I just want to be a superhero.
It's me.
At the Frankenstein Center.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
I'm going inside.
And what if you get killed?
What?
Bye. 
Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.
You're the Sphinx.
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
When are you going to take off that mask?
Oh don't start that again --
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
We had an off night, that's all.
What are you talking about?
And it would be the right thing to do.
Have you ever seen him?
So what else has Superman got?
GET MAD!
But she still might call!
Are you coming or not?
I'll drive.
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
There's a vague similarity.
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
I can't.
So you're chicken?
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
Or flowers.
I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
I'm soaked.  Oh great.
So where's the art?
What's that?
The Obliterators!
Firepower costs money.
Yes, Obie-wan.
We're superheroes.
Are you famous?
Not yet.
So what can I get you?
Here you go. 
Jeffrey!
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
Mother... it's not what you think!
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
But... the silverware?
I use it... to fight evil.
She likes you.
Definitely.
This is bad.
Who are they?
We may be getting in over our heads here.
Or Batman --
Don't crunch the leaves.
Sorry.
And there's the Sphinx.
And a social life.
To us!
Are you sure he's still lives here?
But, Doc... where's the machine guns?
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
Oh no.
We've got lift off!
Through there!
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.
And, what a delightful idea!
Ah -- you approve?
I think it's absolutely charming.
I'm glad you like it.
Yes -- who spoke up?
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
What do you have in mind?
I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
About 5,000 troops.
Any cannon?
There are none here.
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
You could have them here by daybreak.
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
Properly arranged, yes.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
You realize what is at stake?
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
And where is the army?
It is on this road, sire, following me.
Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.
I don't know, sire.
Who is there?
General Bonaparte?
I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.
Yes, sir?
Oh -- where do you come from?
Bastia -- and you?
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Hello there, Picart.
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
Why are you carrying the dog?
My God...!  What time is it?
Four o'clock.
When did it start?
The first reports came in at about ten.
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
How did it spread so quickly?
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.
Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
I am, Citizen.  Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?
Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
Shall we move closer to the fire?
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
Thank you.
Good evening, sir.
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
What's your name?
Lisette.
Only Lisette?
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
No...
No... nothing at all.
Well, you shall see.
Ah, that is good.
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
May I offer you a drink?
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
No.
Were they pretty?
Were any of them prettier than I am?
One had better legs.
Promise me you will never leave me.
I cannot promise you that.
Promise me.
I don't understand you.
Promise.
Promises mean nothing.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
All right -- I promise.
Yes -- what is it?
Open the door.  It's me.
Go away -- I'm busy.
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
Five minutes.
Yes!!
Five minutes.
Separate bedrooms?
But you will not... be safe...
Who is it?
I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
What are you talking about?
Yes.
I wrote it.
What?
Yes, I wrote it.
You wrote it.
I couldn't face telling you.
You couldn't face telling me what?
About Hippolyte Charles.
What was there to tell?
Do you know what you're saying?
God help me -- yes.
How do you know?
I know.
You could hear them?
Can you give me a drink, please?
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
Do you like music?
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
Does she deserve anything better?
Has Alexander agreed to this?
And where do you place Alexander?
What did you say his name was?
Eugene de Beauharnais.
Is he alone?
Yes, sir.
Come in.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
A message from Citizen Fouche.
Come in.
Anything you need.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
And I can go free?
Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
Yeah.
I know you smoke weed, right?
Why you say that?
I don't know!
Stretch it out.
Who are you?
We didn't come here for Day-Day.
Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
No I'm not.
Great moves, Day-Day.
You know what he mean, dude.
Naw, I already ate.
Me neither.
It's about to work, just come on.
Fuck, what's his name?
Man, Day-Day is my people!
What's crackin'?
I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy!
I can't taste nothing.
Who is that?
So.
You know what this is?
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.
$247.
What's the matter?
I ain't trying to get in it.
Blow.
It works.
This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?
Alright, Roach, see you around.
You see that?
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
You go first.
Naw, you go first.
You go first.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
Wait.
You're welcome, Unc.
I will.  When can I come visit?
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
Oh yeah, why you walking?
Hello, remember me?
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
Most definitely.
Huh?
It's locked.
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
Next time, page me first.
You alright?
Delivery!
Delivery!
Here I come!
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
I do.
What it smell like?
Nice neighborhood, huh?
Craig, remember what I told you.
You see that?
You too.
Smokin' what?
Nice to meet you?
Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
I can't give you your damn money back on this.
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
That the big one, huh?
What was that?
Are they still out there?
Roach, what are you doing?
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
Who the fuck is that, Day-Day?
Let it go, Roach, trust me.
Roach...Roach, come on.
Where's Craig?
He's inside the house?
You wanna knock?
'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.
Get 'em, Craig!
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
Ah damn.  Damn.
I got fired too.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Where's Craig?
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
Shut up!  Both of you right now!
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
Why would he take it?  He don't even know you.
Where did Craig move to?
Rancho Cucamonga?
Just do it.
You too big.
I can't feel my legs no more.
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
Ezal!  Ezal!
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
Hey, how you get out of here.
I'll take you later.
Hey, what's going on?
Take your car.
'Take your car?'
I got your message.  Where's Craig?
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
What about that ugly dog?
Need to lose some weight.
Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.
My back.
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
Elroy, what happen?
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
What's he doing here?
Don't remind me.
What happened here?
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
Amtrack?
You just come in on Amtrack?
Uh, yes..
Business or pleasure?
Where'd you come from?
Somebody close?
What?
I need your help.
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
You were saying?  Your daughter....?
I...
She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph.
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
My security people are right next door.
That's...a comfort to hear.
I have a problem.
That's right.
You shot her?
No.
And your husband works for somebody else.
There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.
For what?
Good luck.
Come with us, sir.
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
Yes, yes, I understand.
You're out of your mind.
What's your point?
I will do no such thing.
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
Are you 'fucking with me!?
The gun...
You get another chance in ten minutes.
Tell me why I miss him.
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
How should I...?
I killed you.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
I kill her - and you kill me.
Keep your voice down.
How am I supposed to get away?
Again.
One thirty. California Ballroom.
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
I want'to talk to her.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
You know what I'm gonna do.
Is that something precious?
All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
I think you better put that away.
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
Ready?
Nods.
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
Will you promise me that?
All right. Kisses to you.
You got anything smaller?
Keep it.
It's a twenty.
Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
You remember me?
Oh, man...
Mister, what are you dragging me into?
Cover your mouth.
What are you supposed to do?
Keep the change.
Meet Irene.
Hi.
Irene is going to help.
Well?
I don't know.
Thanks for the shine.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
Fuckin' A.
Oh, we'll have to do better than that.
Goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come here!
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
That's pretty good.
I've done much better ones than this.
I'm not a baby.
Close your eyes.
Why?
I've got something for you.
You got this under control?
Yeah.
It's under control.
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
That one.
Keep your eyes peeled.
I'm looking for them.
Where?
And what happens if I don't call you?
Only you.
That's enough.
Yeah.
Come Back.
Yeah.
Put her on.
What gives?
Any trouble?
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
What do you figure he done with it?
Ben, I'm a Man of God.
Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
Where's your Mom?
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Here they come.
Yes, Dad.
You understand?
..."and I won't never tell about the money."
Ain't seen you in a coon's age, Johnny.
O, she's all right.
How's your sister Pearl?
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?
Uncle Birdie!
I'll light the lamp.
Where's Ruby?
AAA-MENN!
You have all sinned!
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
Say what, Walt Spoon!
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
About what!
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
What's wrong, Mother?
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
Is he hit pretty bad?
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
Lynch him! Lynch him!
Bluebeard!
He lied!
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
John don't like him much.
There's something else.
What?
You go set down by the River.
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
Satan.
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
You, Pearl. You swear too.
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
Hing, hang, hung.
Why?
John...
Now can I tell?
You swore, Pearl!
It's all here.
Where's Mom?
To see Dad?
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
Where are we goin', John?
I'm hungry, John.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
John?
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
John, where are we g --
Are we goin' home, John?
John, where's your folks?
Dead.
Where ye from?
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
I mind you said there was two.
I'll see to Pearl.
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
Tell me what, boy?
What are you doing, boy?
I don't know nothin'!
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
Don't you believe me?
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
Nothin'. 
Mm-hm.
I'll tell you a secret.
Yes?
Now it's your turn.
What secret shall I tell?
How old are you?
Sure, that's no secret.
What's your name?
Yes; John's bad.
O no! Your turn!
All right.
Naturally.
About our secrets.
No.
Why, pray tell?
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
What's their names?
Pearl and John.
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
Didn't you have no inkling?
Yes; from the first night.
The first night?
Our honeymoon.
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
Harry!
Get up, Willa.
Harry, what --
Are you through praying?
You were listening outside the parlor window.
Mornin', ladies.
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
My flesh and blood!
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
What's wrong, John?
What do you want?
Them kids!
What are you after them for?
When did I ever?
This man down at the Drugstore...
What you been up to?
Now who was this?
What'd you all talk about?
Pearl and John.
Miz Cooper!
How long's this been going on?
Okay, good. She's asleep.
Oh my god, oh my god...
Worked like a charm.
It's just a stupid cat.
So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.
Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
Because he was scary, that's why.
What the hell's going on!?
Guess I did.
Haven't slept, have you?
Okay?
Jesus, it's dark in here.
Yeah. So?
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
What happens if they don't do that?
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
Hello?
Hi.
Who?
The killer.
Bring him out of what?
My dream.
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
How you doing, pal?
She dreamed this would happen...
Decide to take a day off after all?
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
He's dangerous.
Hello Nancy.
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
Who? Who did that?
Krueger.
It wasn't that serious...
Where you think you're going?
Right home after.
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
I won't.
Get into bed.
You okay?
Great
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
I must be going nuts...
I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
It's real, Mamma. Feel it.
Screw sleep!
What's with the bars?
All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?
Guess I should'n'a done it.
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
I never touched her.
Someone else was there.
How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
Rod says the sweetest things.
He's nuts about you.
Nice to have a fire.
Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too. He might get jealous.
What the hell you doing here?
You feel better now, right?
Jungle man fix Jane.
No more fights?
Thank you, Comrade.
Well, here are fifty francs.
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Bring me forty-five back.
What is it, Ninotchka?
Good evening, Anna.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
What are you serving?
You should be more careful, Anna.
And you too, Ninotchka.
I have nothing to hide.
Well, a hat...
An evening gown.
A dress you wear in the evening.
Yes.
You want this?
You wouldn't like Razinin.
And how is Lord Lavenham?
Are we free, Buljanoff?
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka.
We don't like Razinin.
Misha! Misha!
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
And they might believe her in Moscow.
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
What a lovely room you have here.
She's right...  anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
I am Comrade Buljanoff.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
Which lawyer?
Comrade Buljanoff...
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
It is high time you got out of Russia.
Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.
Guest?
The Duchess...
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
Good morning, Your Highness.
Good morning, Gaston.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
Good evening, Gaston.
Your breakfast, monsieur.
What time have you, Gaston?
Eight forty-two, sir.
I guess it is eight forty-two.
Your Highness...
Are they indeed? Thank you.
Is this satisfactory?
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
Yes, Leon...
Leon, my little boy.
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
Let's do that.
...des petites fraises des bois... de la crme de Bretagne... 
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
We don't want to be disturbed.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
If you want to see us you must come later.
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
Razinin.
And if we have to go to Siberia...
What did she say about me?
I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Comrade Buljanoff...
Comrade.
Comrade Kopalski...
How much does this cost?
A week?
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
Bad news?
This is Comrade Kopalski.
I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
That's even better.
Yes, monsieur.
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
Allow me, Comrade.
If there is anything we can do for you...
How are you, you three scoundrels?
Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is.
That's two weeks from Thursday...
You want me to go in there?
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
Don't hold that against me... please!
Business.
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously.
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
Yes!
I must get into that country of yours!
Why should I take a chance?
What for... why?
You, please.
How long do we have to wait here?
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
No.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
You might hold this for me.
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
Suppress it.
For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
That's a strange angle.
Please don't misunderstand me...
Then you don't want me to go there.
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
He takes good care of that.
Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
Ni-notchka.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
I'd like to say it a thousand times.
The bayonet? Did you really?
I was wounded before Warsaw.
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
Do you hear that?
Was that talkative?
Glorious, analytical...
The telephone is ringing.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
As a representative of Moscow...
You know I want to...
But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!
I don't like your following me.
I didn't follow you.
Then how did you get here?
I always eat here.
What are you after?
What?
Just smile.
Because we are an odd couple.
Probably not.
Do you like Scotch stories?
Not funny, huh?
You see? Life can be so simple.
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
I promise... I swear.
Did you make any change in this room?
How do you do?
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
You must, darling.
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
What, darling?
Comrades! Comrades!
Darling, darling... please!
I must talk to my brothers!
But, darling, you can't do that.
Comrades! Good people of France!
No speech?
No speech.
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
Are we going to build our little house?
Yes... a little white house.
Not white, darling.
No! No!
...and we won't clench our fist...
Our salute will be a kiss.
Would that make you any happier?
Much happier.
Let's turn on the radio.
No music.
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
Is this the wish of the masses?
Yes, sweetheart. 
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
Hello, Leon!
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
You can't imagine.
Thank you.
Is this your new dress suit?
Yes, Swana.
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
Has done what?
She's gone, Leon.
Hello, Leon darling!
Good morning.
Please come to the point. What is it you want?
That's all right... I grow on people.
I must insist that you leave.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
Here, please...
What do you want?
Well... that's my business, madame.
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
May I ask why?
Cigarette?
You want me to go to Constantinople?
Bring me something simple. I never think about food.
Where do you eat?
It's just a place for workmen.
Your Highness.
How do you do, my friend.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...
You did say it, sir.
Where the hell is he?
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
We could get that.
You want me to put it all in writing? Over my signature?
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
I'll bet he would.
How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States?
It was her wrist.  And it was through a plate-glass door.
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
You do it.
It's a code or something.
I figured that out.
And?
He wants money.
This is not a joke, John!
We can't touch Hoover --
He's begging for a meeting, chief.  He wants to go overseas for awhile.
I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies.
Sorry ...
I don't have a pistol.
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
Who?
Sir, the deadline is today.
Can we get around this, Al?
The army?
Lincoln used it.
That was civil war.
There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.
I know it well, sir.
But O'Brien doesn't even use that office.  The Democrats've moved to Miami.  There's nothing there!
We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
Fucking hell.
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
Just do what I say, Bob.
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
Money.  Follow the money.
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
I believe you're right, boss.
Congratulations, boss.  A great victory!  The madman theory wasn't so crazy after all.
Because they're not Americans.
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
It's Helms -- it's got to be.
We could leverage Helms.
I promised Iran to Townsend.
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
More light, chief?
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
I can't ...
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
Mom expects great things from you ...
I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is secure.
Current levels may not be sufficient.
What?
Mr. Castro.
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
Thank you for coming, Dick.
Can't we just talk here?  I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
How the fuck did you know?
Why, you got a customer?
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
You'll pick up the middle on this one - the Jews and Negros.
Housecleaning?  It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ...
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you.
Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
You know, Mr. Chairman, at Harvard I used your writings in my class.
What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing.
Just ... uh ... you know.
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.
That was Mr. Kennedy.
He was a politician.
Yes.
You know, I voted for you in your last election.
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife.  I'm out of politics.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
But it was all we had.
... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
You're shittin' me.
Hi.
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
I like jazz ...
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Elvis I like, too.
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
We got the press this time!
But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
What's in there?
POWs.  And their families.
So I'm supposed to be ...
Proud?
Sir?
Of them.
Yes, yes.
Or we could write "expletive deleted."
We lost ...
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
Don't you want to listen to Brown's victory speech?
Amen to that.
It's over, Dick.
I'll concede in the morning.
I want a divorce.
I'll do it.  No more.
Are you serious?
Yeah ... I'm out.
Is that the truth?
Dick, you should call Bobby.
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
Were you planning to tell me?
They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
Do you really want this, Dick?
This.  Above all.
I've missed you.
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
They're all your enemies?
Yes.
When?
What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?
You.  What' you're doing --
And what am I doing?
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't talk to me, you ...
You can't expect me to explain that to you.
Oh, Happy!  Dick Nixon ... You remember him.
Won or lost?
Lost.
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
What?
Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard.  On my staff, foreign policy whiz ...
How'd you know I was here.
You heard it?
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
Didn't know there was any.
Want a cup?
What would you a done if he'd been released?
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
Yes, you've circled round.
How come're you doin that?
You don't know what he thinks.
When did he die?
Most don't.
You're discouraged.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
...I don't know what I do feel like.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
He's real all right.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
You ain't heard from him?
No I ain't.
Not word one.
Would you tell me if you had?
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
It's not me he's in trouble with.
Who's he in trouble with then?
Some pretty bad people.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
Carla Jean...
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
...You ride Winston.
That's the boy.
Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two.
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
But you don't believe it.
No. Probably I don't.
We goin' in?
What about yours?
...I believe they've done lit a shuck.
Believe you're right.
Probably must be.
So when was he here?
...Now that's aggravating.
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
What was the bullet?
Wasn't no bullet?
Sir, I don't want to picture that.
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
Yessir. It was punched out.
Okay.
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
...I love you more'n more, ever day.
...Be careful.
I always am.
Don't get hurt.
I never do.
Don't hurt no one.
Maybe I'll go ridin.
Okay.
What do you think.
I can't plan your day.
I mean, would you care to join me.
...How'd you sleep?
I don't know. Had dreams.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
Well they always is to the party concerned.
It ain't even three years we been married.
I got it Mama.
I put it in, Mama.
No.
I ain't got the money.
I wouldn't worry about it.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
You gave your word?
Not like that. Not like you say.
What's in the satchel?
It's full a money.
...Where'd you get the pistol?
Did you buy that gun?
No. I found it.
Llewelyn!
What'd you give for that thing?
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Big talk.
Llewelyn.
Yeah.
What're you doin', baby?
Goin' out.
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
Why would we go to Odessa?
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
What'm I supposed to tell Mama?
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
Why all the way to Del Rio?
Promise?
Yes I do.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
Llewelyn?
Yes ma'am?
Llewelyn?
Hey.
What should I do?
What makes you say that?
She'll be all right.
Why would I let you do that?
If you knew, you would have it with you.
I know something better.
I know where it's going to be.
Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?
You mean the nature of this conversation?
Yessir?
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Did you go up to his trailer?
Where does he work?
I can't say.
Hello?
Is Llewelyn there?
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
What's this about?
...Where's the transponder?
...You getting anything on this?
Not a bleep.
How'd you find it?
Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time.
What airport would you use.
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
Airport.
...You need to talk to me.
I don't need to talk to you.
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
Why would I care where you're going.
...I know where you are.
Yeah. I know where you're going.
All right.
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
...Me?
Yes.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
How much?
Sixty-nine cent.
This. And the gas.
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
What way would that be?
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
Didn't mean nothin'.
...Will there be somethin' else?
Is somethin' wrong?
With what?
Will there be anything else?
You already asked me that.
See about closing.
Yessir.
What time do you close?
...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.
I could come back then.
Well... I need to close now --
Yes I do.
This was my wife's father's place. Originally.
You married into it.
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
Call it.
Yes.
For what?
Everything.
You stand to win everything. Call it.
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
Uh-huh. Double ought.
Tent poles.
You already have the tent?
Never mind.  I want a tent.
What kind of tent?
One room, one night.
That's twenty-six dollars.
You on all night?
Good. I need everything else.
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
I want you to take me to another motel.
Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em.
When did you last see him.
How well do you know Chigurh.
Well enough.
...I'm wondering...
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
I'm sorry.
You tell me the option.
The what?
...You pick the option with the applicable rate.
Could I get another room.
No, one forty-two.
That's me.
Half.
What else then?
Then you'll like me.
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
Not that way.
Not any way.
Took me about three hours.
...What do you do?
I'm retired.
What did you do?
I'm a welder.
Cast iron?
Yes.
I don't mean braze.
I didn't say braze.
Pot metal?
What did I say?
Were you in Nam?
Yeah. I was in Nam.
Why would he go to Odessa?
What product.
The heroin. You don't have it.
No I don't have it.
I don't know. American citizens.
You do, I reckon.
I got an overcoat on.
Are you jackin' with me?
No sir.
Yes sir.
Are you in the service?
No sir. I'm a veteran.
Nam?
Yes sir. Two tours.
No... Friends from the diner maybe?
...I meant your food.
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
Junior year!
Anyway, so what?
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
We think we know where Betty is.
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
What about it?
Any idea where it is?
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
Need something else?
No, I was just... How you doing?
Great. Good. Content...
They're fine... you miss it?
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
Do you know who I am?
...I... I know what you are.
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
I better go check on them.
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
It's all right.
What?
The LeSabre!
Maroon.  I stole it.
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
Yeah, me too.
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
Are you and Larry happy?
Do what?
I gotta go.
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
Why do they keep calling you George?
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
What?
I got you, Del...
...well, then you ain't got much.
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
Make sure it's elevated...
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
Roy! What are you doing here?
I begged him to let me put that on!
Where you headed, Betty?
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
No. Loma Vista.
How did you know?
What's his real name?
Dr. David Ravell.
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
Like Rome?
Worse.
Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
She called you 'George,' George.
What are you doing?
He has no heartbeat!
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
You don't sound like you're from here.
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
It's something I had to do. For David.
I got this apartment with a guy.
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
How many men have I talked to?
You said in L.A., anything goes.
Guess who I saw today.
Who?
Doctor David Ravell.
What? Where was he?!
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
Looking for someone?
Were you with him this whole time?
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
Does he know you think he's real?
He is real.
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
Are you sure I can borrow this?
You should have a little faith in people.
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
...this is your sweater, right?
Where are you going?
What?! That you had something to do with it?
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
Blake, I can handle that transplant!
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
More than you know. Is there anything else?
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it?  They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.
The fuck you talking about?
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
If we're for real?
You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
Bourbon, little water, thank you.
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
Relax, we brought the cash.
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
He told us it's in the Buick.
We don't know which Buick, do we?
We can live with that.
Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
Should I kill him now?
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
Betty, Betty, Betty...
Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too.  Very, very impressive...
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
Half.
That was a really shitty thing to do.
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
How'd they describe her?
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
Where? Where is she?
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
So you believed the bartender. Why?
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
Who's this?
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
This is Betty at twelve.
...and how long did she work here?
Oh, five years, give or take.
Seems like a nice place.
Really?
Jesus Christ!
He's waiting...
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
We know that...
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Yeah? The sport utility?
Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too.
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
You lie, motherfucker...
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
Her show?
Yeah?
Mr. Campbell?
Huh?
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
Hang on there -
We ain't gonna make it walkin'.
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
That's right!
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
...Pete?
We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
What do we do now, Everett?
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
Five... hunnert... thousand... each.
Four hundred, Delmar.
I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
...I'm not sure that's Pete.
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
'N turned into a frog -
Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!
I'm sayin' we har this man away.
What's his name again?
You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
Finest governor we've ever had in M'sippi.
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Latch right on to that tit.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Devil his due.
Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Pullin' ah pants down...
Helluva idea.
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
Vernon Waldrip.
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
Not out the other side his face, though.
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
It's just a symbol, honey -
That's not my ring.
- in the gods - Huh?
That's not my ring.
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
Well, I'm sorry honey -
Uh-huh.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
Yes, but honey -
I counted to three, honey.
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
Who was fixing to betray us!
You didn't know that at the time!
So I borrowed it till I did know!
A million dollars.
Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
It was a moment a weakness!
Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...
Two weeks! That don't do me no good!
Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan.
I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
Who's the honcho around here?
Now what can I do you for, Mister French?
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
Daddy!
That's a maiden name.
It's bona fide!
She's at the five and dime.
You, Zack?
I been calling for four months.
Come back here, kid!
What for?
Okay, okay. You win.
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I.
So what're you doing in Seattle?
Who gave you this idea?
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
Yes, Joe.
When did this happen?
He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?
What's your name, boy?
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
I want to fly jets, sir!
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
Mayo, are those your friends?
Yes, sir!
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
I know.
See you in the fleet, sir!
Hi, son.
What did you call me?
What did you call me, boy?
I called you Sarge.
No.
No, sir!
No, sir.
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
No, sir.
Where are you from, boy?
What did you call me, Mayo?
Yes, sir!
Louder!
Is your brother a flyer?
He was. He died.
Vietnam?
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
Something tells me you've been here before.
You're sure it's okay?
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
Sid, there's no baby.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
That was you guys, huh?
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
Everything was different.
You serious about having him over?
No. I never feel like that.
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
You got a girl?
Not me.
I vote for the motel.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
He didn't give you much choice.
There's always a choice.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
I know who you are and what you want.
What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?
I forgot to thank you for breakfast.
That was great.
Want me to get a towel?
I'll get it if you want.
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
What's the matter?
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Are those for me?
So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
I'm looking for Sid.
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
Why?
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
You told us it would grow out an inch.
Could you believe those girls!
You okay?
Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
Do you know that for sure?
You're fuckin' A we can do this.
You're welcome.
What if she called the cops?
He said open it.
You should see the look on your face.
Me.  I am.
That's right.
I have the gun.
Yes.
Remember that.
What?  What do you want me to do?
One.  Squeeze.
This is ridiculous...
Two.  Squeeze harder.
I can't just...
Th --
Okay, okay!  Okay.
Are you okay?
She's gonna handle it.
Not that one.
We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
Fuck!
Keep your voice down.
They're not supposed to be here!
This was your department, Junior.
They're not supposed to be here!
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
I mean, right?  Isn't it?
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
Forty-five minutes.  That's all you said you need.  That's like nothing.
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
What about us?  What if she has a gun?
Open it.
They're coughing.
Cell phone.
She's never coming out.
Hey.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
Yeah, whatever.
I mean it!
Yeah?
Everything okay?
Somebody called you?
Can we come in?
What do you want?
We'd like to come in.
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
One day you will learn to respect other people's time, Lydia, one day you --
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
Could the child please stop that?
That door is a safely hazard.
That's highly inappropriate.
Watch your mouth.
Cut it back a little bit.
We're leaving.
Suit yourself.
Nobody leaves.
No cars.  Feet are faster.
How many more do we have after this?
Something's weird.
Makes me nervous.
Why?
No, Edgar Allen.
Too many stairs.
Got us in here, didn't I?
Shoulda got an apartment.
The crowd goes wild.
478...
Fuck him.
Don't.
What's going on?!
He's going down.
That room!
What?!
Damn it!
Can't hear a thing.
What do they want?
What do we do?
I heard you.
Feel okay?
Yeah.
Shaky?
Nope.
Chills?
"What we want is in that room."
They're coming in here, aren't they?
Say fuck.
"Get the fuck out of my house."
Oh, please.
Are you freaking out?
Small space?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
What am I, a five year old?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
I don't know, why?
I am.  I'm here.
YOU HAVE TO!
What, what, what is it?!
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
Got him!
Do it.
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
Call Dad!
He'll do something.
He --
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What?
What if I keep dropping?
Tyrone...
Alma I told you to...
What are you doing with the gun?
Well... is it loaded?
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
Well if anyone's gonna protect Malcolm's legacy it better be us.
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
You got to sit on Eldridge...
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
Huey!! Man you gotta check this out... You're gonna love...
Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too?
What the fuck?
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Get out of the car.
What's with you?
Inspector Brimmer
Yeah, it's me.
Hey... what the hell you doing?
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
God damn... Kid never had a chance...
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
Man, fuck you!!!
Motherfucker... you stay away...
Hey, this what they got you doing now?
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?
Cy... I ain't even sure.
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
Can you make a deal with them?
Yes sir I was.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
Did you shoot the officers in question?
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
We need money first...
So talk...
You were. infantry right?
We appreciate your help with this.
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
Whatever you need, I'll be there.
What's the pig's name?
Yeah, I do.
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
Maybe...
If you got something to say, say it.
What's up with you?
You got something on your mind... "brother."
We'll all get out of here together.
What?
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Where is he?.
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
You don't look alright.
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
You believe that?
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
No.
When?
Late summer.
Congratulations.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
You call that a compliment?
Next time we'll bring more blankets.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
You got me beat on both accounts.
You got salt last week.
You look well, Charlotte.
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
Excuse me?
I said, I'm not my sister.
I know that.
Do you?
Of course, I do.
Goodbye, Charlotte.
You're surrendering.
Yes, sir.
What unit?
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
We did.
My pleasure, sir.
Colonel will do.
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
That is a separate issue.
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
If I fail, you fail.
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
Have you seen any Redcoats?
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
We'd cover more ground if we split up.
Is that so?
Did your father teach you humility?
And, Corporal...  ... be careful.
How old are you?
You know how old I am.
Flanking riders?
These four wagons must be his.
Father?
You learned her lessons better than I.
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
Granted.  Where are you going?
Don't go in there.
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
You know what happened.
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
That's right.
It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that.
I don't care.  I hate him.
A long time ago...
That's five, keep going...
... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
I am, I think.
Fall, six months at the earliest.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
Don't touch him.
How many men have we seen die?
Goodbye, Francis.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
Your son, what did you name him?
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
How far away?
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
But what about Thomas?
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.
Gray.
I was sorry to hear about your son.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
Francis, tell me about General Cornwallis.
Remember Braddock?
That bad?
Not yet, Thomas.
Put those away.
But father, they might come this way.
Father, I saw a post rider at the house.
Father?
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
Bite?
Well...I guess not.
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Please hurry.
Yes.
No-I guess not.
I want to look around, daddy-- may I?
Is he really all right?
Yes.
Because you promised.
Ellie? What's wrong?
No more chocolate chip cookies.
But don't you dare say that.
You believe in it.
I'm not tired!
Then why do I have to go to bed?
Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.
Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
You need a glass?
Not at all.
What were you listening to?
Allman Brothers.
Not yet...how much further is it?
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
Bagged cat. What a mess.
Going to tell Ellie?
But--
Does she love the cat?
Yes, but--
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
Almost there, Louis.
You keep saying that.
This was their burying ground, Louis.
Doesn't look like they last long.
Don't worry about that.
Jud, why am I doing all this?
Can I have another one?
Rachel not feeling well?
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
It's Ellie's cat.
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
Shit! Look at this mess!
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
Let her go. It's cool.
And Buckaroo Banzai.
Gage's gone!
Thank you. Thank you so much.
My God!
I think it's rather extraordinary.
That's enough of that kind of talk!
Getting there.
I got eggs down here!
I'm going to try to do better.
You better get going, hon.
Louis, are you sure?
My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
That boat is my livelihood!
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
What's in your head, boy?
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
That's right.
Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
So how did you get off that island, anyway?
The situation has changed.
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
There's ... another exit?
Now?
Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
You have a name, missy?
You've got sand, for a maid.
Maid or not, it fits you.
Do you not know what this is, then?
Man overboard!
I can't breathe.
Commodore, I must protest.  Pirate or not, this man saved my life.
Commodore, you can't do that!
Then I can wear men's clothing.
Ceremony?
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
I'm glad we got here in time.
If I had known --
I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
You?!
Me!
Drink up me hearties, yo ho ...
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
To freedom.
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
We'd best drop canvas, sir!
How did you get off the island?
Blast it, I'm already awake!
We're not going to just surrender!
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?  You two weren't invited?
What's your name?
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
We had time to get to know each other.
They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
You threatened Miss Swann.
Move away.
No.
Somewhat.
Why ask me?
Because you're a pirate.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
I can get you out of here.
Agreed.
Not without my effects.
I'd die for her.
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
Is that so?
That's not true.
I swear, you look just like him.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
Just do it quickly.
What's that?
Depends.
No.
Are you certain this is the right way?
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
No, it's not.
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
You've seen it?
Yes.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
Yes.
You haven't seen it.
... No.
He's not telling the truth.
That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
He's still breathing.
A moment.
But --
Speak.
Wheelchair accessible.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
What are you going to do to him?
Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
How apropos.
I know what you're doing.
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
Like rotting meat.
It's ready now, I know it is.
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
And you still believe he's going to come here?
Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?
Why are there two ottomans?
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
It will be an ascension.
Considering what?
If you loved me like I loved you?
Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.
Where did he go?
They're here!  They're here!  We have the nanobot.
Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.
Hey!
You don't want this.
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs?
Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
What did security say?
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
Well, you got another problem.
Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.
I bet he hasn't read a single report we've written on the waste problem.
You were never invited to my house.
Is that what Argon told you?
You're afraid of him.
Yes?
What's it smell like?
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
Sir, please try to hold still.
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
When did you...?
Been out for six months now.
Really?  What have you been doing?
Somebody has to.
The big house?
Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
Nothing really worthwhile.
Yeah, we'll see.
Daniel, give him the Trix.
Susie!  You gotta help me!
Daniel, what are you doing here?
Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
They did it to me!
... just like the mouse.
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
What happened to it?
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
We don't have time for hysterics.
That was an egg?
Three days ago it was.
What do these replicators do to people?
That's right.
Is something wrong?
Susan!
Look at this!
What's that supposed to mean?
Just giving credit where credit is due.
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
Uh oh.  I remember that temper.
What's wrong?
The nanobot... it's not here...
How far can you stretch?
What did you want my hair for?
That's pretty good.
That's going to fit me?
Did you go?
Who is he?
Where is it?
Argon's private lab.
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!
You saved my life.
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
We've got to get the nanobot.
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
I remember I was trying to help...
God, what a fight that was.
Things do change.
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
Yeah, and what might that be?
That's impossible.
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
And you have him?
I could have you fired right now.
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
What in the hell?
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
Indeed? How interesting.
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
I think I better go, Stew.
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
May I use your telephone?
Certainly. Right over there.
Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
Where did you get those letters?
I suppose you're going to print them?
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
For what?
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
Of course I am Stewart.
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
I'm not going!
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
Anne, come here. Listen
Oh hello, Anne He types furiously.
That's an excellent idea.
Ah-ah-ah!
Mother!
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
You're the Tribune man?
Fine. Have a seat.
This way.
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
Well, I should say!
I knew your managing editor very well.
Is that so?
Yale '21, I believe.
Huh?
Is that so?
Thank you very much.
All right, all right, don't mention it.
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Impossible. Put it on again.
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
Look, I quit!
Yeah?
Yeah.
With me you can always do business.
Gloria Golden?
Right - for the first time this year.
Well - it's only April.
Not on my own beat, no.
Well, when are you quitting?
Is that so?
My play.
Araby?
Sure.
I'm not quitting!
No?
You're my what?
What are you doing fooling around in here?
All right, outside!
I beg your pardon, sir?
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
and that
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
And the rest of us are truck horses?
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
Thanks, thanks.
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
Staring at us?
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
Hello, Stew.
Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.
Been where?
To Old Madrid.
Never even been to New Madrid.
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Did who?
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
Hey, Gallagher!
Who was that?
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
A statement? Good.
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
You quit trying to stop anybody
Hello, Smith.
Holy jumping swordfish!
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
Surely, come right in.
I don't eat waffles.
Fine, but kinda thirsty.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
Okay - you remember Joe
Come in, Joe. It's all right.
Some bicarbonate - quick!
Double-strength!
Are the cars ready?
Smythe, you've been drinking.
With pleasure, Madame!
Stop calling me Mother!
Have you seen this? 
Yes - the worm!
What's going on here? Who is this woman?
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
Well done, sir. Very neat.
Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.
Shhh! Do you hear something?
Yes, sir.
You try it.
Me, sir?
Yes, sir.
Found no skeletons?
No, sir.
It's haunted just the same.
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!
Mary Sue?
What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
What?
It doesn't matter.
... Sex.
Yes.
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Oh no ... I'm fine.
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
Have you got any make up?
Does it look okay?
Looks just like it did.
And they won't be able to tell?
Wait.
Thank you.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
Thanks ... I love you.
Oh, hello Betty.
Oh, hi ...
I'm sorry ...
I just thought ... It's beautiful.
Having kind of a tough time.
I think it looks nice.
Where'd you get this?
Bud brought it to me.
Bud?
What?
She's crying.
No she's not.
Wait ...
It's alright. Let me see.
What is that?
Like a drum.
I told you where I was.
I told you, George. I'm not going.
Sure you are.
Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.
It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
It goes away ... It'll go away.
Where are you gonna go?
I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
Really Biff? The keenest?
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
But where would we go?
Sure is pretty.
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
It is?
Mary Sue--C'mon ...
What are you doing?
It's six-thirty ...
So.
Oh.  I can't.
I'm busy.
Don't! Just let go.
What?
I don't believe it.
She won't go out with me?
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
That's not going to happen!
Want some bridge mix?
Oh, no thanks ...
Rain.
Did you do this?
Do you know that it's illegal?
It's like the basketball team.
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
You're not allowed to lie.
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
It's not in ME.
What do you mean!?
And where's that?
What's outside of Pleasantville?
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
Hello Bud.
Mr. Simpson ...
No, not that hedge. The other one.
What are you doing?
Pleasantville Marathon?
Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
Get lost!
Oh my God.
What happened?
What did you do?
Oh God.
I don't believe this.
I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.
I still don't see why we're doing this.
You know him?
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
Does he--you know--like "me"?
Those are my friends.
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
Can we do any better?
What were you doing in a library?
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
He won't notice anyway.
What do you mean?
They don't notice that kind of thing.
So what's the point?
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
You have no right to do this.
Well if I don't who will?
They don't have that kind of potential.
Me too. Sounds swell.
It's okay.
Not directly anyhow ...
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Are you sure?
I told you. I'm like positive.
This thing works. We could go home right now.
You got the admissions letter.
Right here.
That was sure swell ...
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
No. I baked them for you.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
Hi.
Sure ... Where would we go?
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
So what's it like?
What?
Yeah.
Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
You want some berries?
What's going on?
Rain.
Real rain?
What do we do?
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
Can I open it?
Where are they?
You're gonna forget about me.
I like calling you David.
Scout?
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
Right. And how did she dress him?
... Like Prince Charming.
McIntire's.
Why would I do that?
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
Hello there.
I can't.
Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
I want a word with you ...
Oh--well ...
OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!
I didn't do anything wrong.
No you're not.
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
OW!
Just gimme the damn remote!
How long do you think you've been here?
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
I'm going on trial tomorrow?
I'm so glad you're here.
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Do you have the lettuce?
... Yeah.
Have you cooked the burgers?
Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
Bud ...
Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.
Forget about that!
You know what I really like?
... What's that?
Really?
Oh, hi.
Hi.
Aren't you a little early?
It's an art book.
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
TV repair?
Yeah. TV busted?
Yeah ...
What happened?
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
Cool.
This is Barry.
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
Yeah but what are you doing?
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
...yes I'm still on hold...
What city?
Somewhere in Utah.
What's the listing?
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
Hello.
So you're coming tonight, right?
Well I don't want to do something like that.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
That's your fault not mine.
I don't think I'm going to the party.
She's really cute and she's really nice.
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
I'm trying to be your friend.
You just said very food.
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
No.
You look nervous.
I have work, I can't leave.
It's not cool?
It's fine, but --
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
I feel really on the spot now.
Are you gonna do it?
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
What's all this pudding?
It's not mine.
Why's it here?
Goodbye.
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
I....please don't do this.
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
Hello, this is Back.
Hi, is this Jack?
Yes.
This is Georgia.
Hi. This is Jack.
Where are you?
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
No.
Do you like porno movies?
Yeah? So what are you doing, then?
Are your pants off?
It doesn't matter.
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
It doesn't matter.
No.
You have a girlfriend?
...yes...
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
...yeah....well you have me now.
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
I'm fine. Who is this?
Georgia.
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
You're going to work now?
Can I ask you a question?
Me?
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
You don't even know how much it is.
I know but I....how much is it?
Really? Please?
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.
So you think you can?
Hello?
This makes me very uncomfortable.
I don't have a girlfriend --
-- you said you did.
I know I did. But I don't.
You lied to me?
Why did you tell me you did, then?
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
This is not cool.
I have to go.
No.
They're not open yet?
I don't know.
Do you know them.
Hi.
Business is good, you're busy?
Yeah, not really.
Do you have brothers or sisters?
-- well, if you're gonna go --
This is funny.
Ok.
Alright?
....Hi.....
Who is it?
How long have you known her?
About six months.
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
Yeah.
You see?
....yeah....
So that was your pudding?
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
No I didn't say that.
Is everything ok?
Yes.
What happened?
Nothing.
What did he want?
There's a better place for us to eat.
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
...yes I did...?
Are you learning how to play it?
Yes? I'm trying.
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
Yeah.
If you come to Hawaii --
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
You don't think you'll go --
This is Barry.
This is Lena.
Really?
That was good.
I'll see you later.
I don't freak out very often.
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
...I don't know what you mean....
Have a good trip.
Lena?
Yeah?
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
About six months ago. Why?
Where you married?
Ok. So you were married for how long?
Yeah......yeah.....
It's so nice.
Do you wanna have sex?
Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.
This is funny.
Yeah.
Where do you have to go?
For what?
How many times have you been on an airplane?
I think maybe over a hundred.
Yeah.
It's ok to ask that.
Are you ok?
I'm fine are you ok?
Yes I'm sorry.
What is this?
You left me at the hospital.
I'm sorry.
You can't do that.
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
If you wanted to call me back I could...
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
Ok.
Ok, bye, bye.
Yeah.
Did you do it?
No.
I don't know.
You're hand is bleeding.
I cut myself.
How?
I didn't do that.
Why? ...what?
Your hand is bleeding.
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
Please don't do this to me.
Hello, how are you?
Hi, is this your first time calling?
......and this is confidential?
What do you mean?
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
And your name?
Barry Egan.
337.....I'm sorry....
It's ok, take your time.
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
No one will know your name.
Can you say that my name is Jack?
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt.
That's that.
Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....
Sorry about that.
How you doin' Barry?
Hi Walter.
That was weird. I meant good.
What's up?
Fine, thank you.
It takes time to process --
Hey, good morning, Barry.
You ok?
Yes I'm fine.
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
Why is it here? Barry....Barry?
Good morning, Barry....
You should go on a trip.
WHICH?
What happened?
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
Yeah.
Hey.
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
How much money do you have in your pockets?
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
What do you have in the house?
You have an ATM?
Yes.
Is this where you live?
I'm sorry.
Are you serious with this?
Yes. Sorry.
This is a bunch of bullshit.
This is Barry.
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
Are you going to the party tonight?
Yes I am.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
Seven o'clock.
You can't be late.
I won't.
I'm serious.
I know.
Seriously.
Ok.
You can't be late though.
Seriously.
I know.
Yeah but I'm serious.
I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.
Don't puss out.
That's cool.
When can you leave?
I thought Latisha said you would --
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
Ok.
So they'll go.
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
What did you say?
Nothing.
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
I'll go pay for my car.
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
He did seem a little strange.
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
I'm sorry. You're right.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
Should I call you later?
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
-- and the listless ones do the binding.
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
He's a writer, not a madman.
If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
"To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --"
Madeleine --
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
By whom? The Marquis?
Go back to your room. Quickly.
What? What've I done?
Free his mouth.
Mustn't do that, sir.
I must grant him his last rites.
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --
But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
You mean to take us all down with you?
He can't do that to me.
I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
I have a proposition.
Good day, Marquis.
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
What on earth would that require?
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
Coulmier, you animal!
Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?
It's no secret that you loved her.
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
I saw the longing in your eye --
-- that was lust --
Don't confuse one organ with another --
I know, because I felt it myself --
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
AND DID YOU?
Why was it you never took her by force?
Who's to say I did not?
Was it impotence?
Abbe de Coulmier!
Of course.
Oh. That.
You have to believe me, I had no idea --
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
And --?
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
It was fiction, of course.
Of course.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
How is the patient faring?
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
I'll be waiting.
Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
Yes?
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
I'm hungry for a proper visit.
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
Is it terribly erotic?
Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
Surely you've seen a man naked.
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
It's tainted money, Doctor.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
Oh, but I am!
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
You've come to lecture me?
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
Leave at once --
But it's just begun --
Doesn't that please you?
I'd rather read, thank-you.
Ever met Walter Winchell?
No, when I was but a tender lad--
So you ever gonna do a picture?
I wonder sometimes.
You're just scared.
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
God, these parties are the worst
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
I can't
Sure you can, just--
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
Who are you, sir?
My name is Orson Welles
The actor
Louis
You know that can't happen.
Oh, why is that?
Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!
How bad is it?
How much?
It's not really--
We're 125 million dollars in debt?
This picture--
Then you explain it to me?!
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
You needn't use that language with me
I wanted it
There's a different between want and
That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
You will not walk out on me
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
I will not have this in my home.
Thank you for your time
Sir, I-
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
Keep filming.
I can't remember the lines!
"You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
You drink at 10 am, do you?
He personally asked you to?
Hearst?
Can I talk to Hearst?
What are movies about, Orson?
Forget it-
What are movies about?
Telling stories.
Nope.
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
Like a bug.
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
Manolete?!
Who the hell's Manolete?
The great Spanish bullfighter
The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!
Yes.
Please don't say this.
So speaks the court jester.
Fuck you
Listen to me-
Why her?
It's 350 pages long.
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
Craig is one syllable
Uh huh.
I want you back
I'm sorry.
Did I ever tell you about my father?
Hedy Lamarr?
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
Shit
Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies. Not one of them.
Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
To do what?
That's for me to decide.
You talked to New York?
Yes
Yes
Pardon?
Please don't ask me to do this.
For the title
This is an abomination There's no music and--
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
You're not still mad at me, I hope
Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
I think you better sit down
It was fun, wasn't it?
It was the best, kid
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
Orson, you wanna take five?
I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--!
How 'bout a real drink?
We done?
Yes!
He's Christ?
Let's go, Jake, wake up!
Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
Hey champ!
Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
Aside from everything else, your family all right?
Believe what you want.
This looks done.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
Where you going at this hour?
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
And where you goin'?
Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
You know?
Yeah. Do me a favor.
Sure. What is it?
Hit me in the face.
You want me to do what?
You heard me, I said hit me.
Jack, I got no gloves.
Harder.  Take the towel off.
Jack! Enough!
Answer me when I talk to you.
Who's that?
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
Huh?
You wasn't with her?
With her? How?
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
Do you see her yet?
You want the title shot?
Say what you're gonna say.
You want the title shot or not?
Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
C'mon, Joey.
Except fall down like a normal person.
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
Screw you, Jack.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
No, I just told you what happened.
Whatever you touched, that's good now.
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
What do you mean, "you"?
What?
But you said "you."
Whadda ya mean?
Did you ever fuck my wife?
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.
What time is it?
Nine o'clock.
At night?
Yeah. At night.
How many pounds I gotta lose?
He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.
You don't talk very much.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
It feels real good.
Should I hit it?
I can't find my ball.
Can you see it?
No.
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
Jake...
You said never to touch you before a fight.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
Take off my pants.
Jake...
Now, touch me...  ...here.
Joey's right. Janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking...
Who asked you?
But, Jake, I was just...
Who asked you?
I was just...
What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
I'm not interested in him.
You're not interested in him?
Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
What?
You asleep?
Yeah.
Huh?
Nobody. I love you, remember?
What did I say?
That he's got a pretty face.
I never noticed his face.
I went out.
Where you been all day?
I took the kids to my sister's.
What'd you see?
I went to the movies.
What'd you see?
"Father of the Bride."
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.
You did?
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
No, not that.
Then what?
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
Why don't you just call him?
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
I'm leaving you Jake.
Are you drunk?
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
Don't make no difference no more.
Hi, Tommy. How are you?
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
Never felt better.
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
How's the weight? Ok?
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
All right, I'll try. See you later.
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
This is the baby sitter.
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
He has it. Thank you.
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
Jefferies?
Name me a better photographer.
But his leg!
Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
For instance?
His wife took a trip.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
I think they missed their chance with her.
She never left the apartment --
-- until yesterday morning.
What time?
I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
Feel a little foolish?
Who left -- where?
How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
But I'm not a killer!
Jefferies.
This is Doyle, Jeff.
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
Jefferies.
Congratulations, Jeff.
For what?
For getting rid of that cast.
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
Hello.
Gunnison?
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
It's me.
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
Hello.
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
I can't. The police have it by now.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
I predicted it.
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
You've got a hormone deficiency.
I knew it!
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
She expects me to marry her.
That's normal.
I don't want to.
That's abnormal.
She's just not the girl for me.
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
Keep your mind off her.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
What about this morning? Any developments?
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
A Federal offense.
Police?
Huh?
I'm just going to get the name of their truck!
Thank heaven that's over!
I wonder.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
What are you two talking about?
Got a shovel?
There's probably one in the basement.
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
Smart girl.
Smart? She'll be arrested!
What do you need money for?
One hundred and twenty-seven.
How much do you think you'll need?
Hello.
Mrs. Doyle?
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
Not yet, Jeff.
You haven't even heard from him?
It is something really important, Jeff?
Goodnight, you idiot.
How's your leg?
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
And your stomach?
And you love life?
Not too active.
Anything else bothering you?
The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
Something big going on somewhere?
Big enough?
What a day I've had!
Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
You can't buy that kind of publicity.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
I wish there was one I wanted.
Make the one you want.
You mean leave the magazine?
Yes.
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
How can you tell that -- from here?
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
You don't think either one of us could ever change?
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
You mean "goodnight."
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
Don't you ever have any problems?
I have one now.
So do I.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
I wouldn't dare answer that.
What do you think?
You'd better before you catch the disease!
Maybe she died.
It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
What's the apartment house number?
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
I wonder where he's going now?
I don't know.
Something on your mind, Lisa?
It doesn't make sense to me.
What doesn't?
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
We have all -- what?
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
I have the whole weekend off.
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
From his landlord -- once a month.
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
I do?
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
I hate funny exit lines.
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
Is he cleaning house?
Wasn't that close?
Shut up. I'm all right.
Your name?
L. B. Jefferies.
Phone number?
Chelsea 2-5598.
What's that?
A new disease.
Friend of yours?
I'm glad they let you out.
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
Feel okay?
What's happening?
You know something?
What?
Hey, he's real abstract and different.
Meaning me?
What?
I thought only punks fought with knives.
Machismo?
Where can we meet?
What you say your name was?
Jim Stark.
Buzz Gundersen.
Hi.
Sure.  It's fine.
Yeah.
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
We heard firing.  He get anybody? You alone?
Smashed the front door.
Any other entrance?
You see any cops?
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
I think I should go home.
No.  We're going to bring him down.
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
What time is it?
Hang loose.  We got all night.
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
Tell him why we moved here.
Hold it, Jim.
Mother--
So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
You thought I was Mom?
And you dropped it?
Yeah!  Shh!
You awake?
How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
Will you let him tell it!
I don't think so--
Except yourself!
Will you wait a minute?
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.
Excuse us a minute?
Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.
Have some cigars.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
You sure?
Really, Frank?  When was that?
He's just loaded, honey.
Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
Frank?  I'm frightened.
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
Are you going down there?
See?  It stopped.
Who's there?  Anyone there?
Is he there?
John Crawford?
Yes, sir.
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
Where did you get the gun?
Come back tomorrow.
Hi.
Hi there.
You remember me?
No.  I don't think so--
You shouldn't monkey with him.
What's your name!
Jim.  What's yours?
You scared?
I just don't want trouble.
I'm here.
Are you really going to meet them?
Who knows.  Plato?
What?
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
Jim!
Who's that!
It's me!
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
They're looking for you!--
Judy.
I'm here.  Shut up.
Come out come out wherever you are!
We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?
What?
There's only one key.
We'll take it!
Man, you're schizoid!
Isn't he schizoid?
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!
That's swell.  How are you?
No.  At dawn.
Can I keep it?
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
Why?
They like you.  Okay?
Who's that?
Just a guard.
I shot at one of them.
I'm sorry.
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
'Bye, Mom.
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
What's that got to do with it?
Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
Get lost.
Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
Leave me alone.
No.
He called me chicken.
And your folks didn't understand?
They never do.
Things pretty tough for you at home?
What a zoo!
Pretty mixed up?
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Hi.  I saw you before.
Bully for you.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
"Life is crushing in on me."
Who lives?
Won't mother be proud.
Where's Dawson High School?
You going there?
Yeah--why--
Dig the square wardrobe!
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
A what?
Goodbye!  See you!
It doesn't matter to them.
You were looking for me, weren't you?
You still pretty upset?
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
Why did you do that?
I felt like it.
Well--we're newlyweds.
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
You can't talk underwater!
Ever been in a place like this before?
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
I don't know.
Hi.
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
You don't need to do that.
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
What?
So do you.
It is for me too.
No!
We have to go back!
Is he your friend?
Yes.  My best friend.
Hi, Plato!
Judy--we're ready for you now.
What?
He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
I'll never get close to anybody.
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
She's being called for.
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
Are you and Mom home tonight?
Good evening.
Didn't you forget something?
I was talking to Dad.
I guess I just don't understand anything.
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
Must have a way with stationery.
Gabriel, let him go --
Read a lot about you, Nick.
What are you doing here?!
Gabriel!
A man of some travels.
Is this him!?
He wants the money.
He wants... your "sister"...
To all those cons...
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
Toys for... adults?
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
Gotta be ten degrees out there.
Radio said negative five.
Negative five?
I don't think it's negative five.
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
No, hey, I like your coat --
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
Do that again.
What.
No --
One more. Smile. One more.
Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
I told you, Nick. Remember?
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
You forget where I work?
Beauty and fragrances.
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
We could live it up and --
I'll see what I can do.
NO!
You motherfucker.
You sold him out.
Nick, I love you --
Get the hell off of me!
He'll kill you.
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
Nick, please, it's me --
You told him about Nick's letters.
You're in on this.
Gabriel!
He working for them on this one?
They've never done a robbery?
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
Get your own room, Ashley.
Nick...
That guy knows you?
We get to the bridge, we're all right!
Nick, the ice is --
We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
Don't say my name...
They'll have guns.
I don't know...
He wants to see your map.
I'm almost done.
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
They all are. Football's on.
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!
You... you... YOU --
I saved your life.
Merry Christmas, Rudy.
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
You said it a million times!
No, you can't --
You're not Nick Mason...
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
Wish I had a brother like you.
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
What's her middle name?
Bam Bam.
What'd they call her in college?
What college.
Be more specific.
A station wagon in Canada.
What's her greatest fear?
Her brother.
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
You knew the place --
I don't know.
The hell you don't.
I did.
This isn't the Tomahawk.
We walked the place for a week.
They won't recognize me.
Why not.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
Bring back some memories, Nick?
Rather be back in the Mountain?
Might as well be.
You do.
Do I get a country-western name?
You got one hour.
Got something to say to me, Nick?
What'd you tell that casino manager?
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
No way.
I'm no threat without a gun.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
You gotta be kidding me.
Get in the CAR!
Ash?
...so where is he?
Where is he?! Where is he?!
I can't go back to Vegas...
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
What about the Powwow Safe?
Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas the season...
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
Thanks, sister. How are ya.
Fuckin' freezing.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
Five years. Since it opened.
How long ago was your makeover?
Having romance problems, Romeo?
How do we take them out?
You gotta get someone upstairs.
Here's my present to you, truck drivers --
You knew there were guns in here!
It's a roach, guy --
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!
Haven't thought about it.
Ain't there yet.
Three days, man.
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
I'm just talking.
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Just a roach, Zook.
GUARD! GUARD!
Alamo...
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
GUARD!!!
No, man! No, no, no!
Tell Ashley... I...
YOU TELL HER!
NO!!!
How'd you know I'd do it.
That was my king!
POP! That was My card!
But... I had a five...
There is no other table --
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
Start talkin
That's what it looks like!
Map is kinda dirty, Monster...
Alone at last.
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
How ya doin', Toothpick?
You ain't dying, he is.
I'll call somebody.
Where was she from, Compton?
The motherfucker killed Vic.
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.
Daddy, did ya see that?
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
What? Nobody set anybody up.
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
Who, Mr. White?
Did the two of you talk?
Me and Mr. White?
A little.
What about?
The Brewers.
Didja use the commode story?
It's a scene. Memorize it.
But what is this?
I'm sorry.
Just hold on buddy boy.
Who's your parole officer?
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
Why am I Mr. Pink?
Mr. Blue's dead?
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
Give me my book.
You gonna put it away?
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
Sorry, it's my book now.
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
What for?
What's the cut, poppa?
What the fuck are you talking about?
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
Don't ask me that.
Mr. Pink.
Mr. Pink?  Why?
He don't tip.
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
Your name's Freddy something.
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
What're you talkin' about?
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
Follow you where?
Down to my car.
Why?
For what, the cops?
You didn't ask.
I'm okay.
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
C'mon, throw in a buck.
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
I don't believe in it.
Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
Want a smoke?
That's not correct.
A few cops.
No real people?
Uh-uh, just cops.
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
How can you be so sure?
I got the diamonds.
Where?
I got 'em, all right?
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
So, is he dead or what?
He ain't dead.
So what is it?
Well, he knows a little about me.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
Is that supposed to be funny?
I told ya he'd be pissed.
Not these guys.
Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
Who shot who?
What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
It doesn't matter who they are.
This must have been in the family a long time.
And this is Helen Carter.
Yes, ma'am.
As far as -- Sonora?
Our kind of women?
And this is Helen Carter.
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
There's a nice boy.
They're stragglin'.
So that was why she tried to run away.
Hold on.
We can't stay here!
I'll make the soap myself.
He knows his alphabet.
Are we leaving?
You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
Maybe it's better that way.
Tell me, darling.
What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
All my clothes --
So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
It's going to Sonora.
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
Where you going?
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
I found their surrey --
I -- lost something.
Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
Which ranch?
How does she draw?
Who's Lednov?
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
What was he in jail for?
In a fight?
Yes.
At the ranch maybe?
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
Where'd they go?
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
Finished, son?
I didn't stop to think, Clay.
All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
You know what she asked me?
Is that the only reason you came back?
Sure. What other reason would there be?
Kind of sore.
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
All right, you didn't know.
I can't take her with me.
You're not bein' quite fair.
All right, you didn't know.
I can't take her with me.
You're not bein' quite fair.
I said I didn't care.
Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.
Don't act so -- crazy.
I'm sorry. Let's go.
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
You got no business snoopin' around --
What is it?
Just a thing I was workin' on.
Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
What's the matter -- restless?
Yes, people make me restless.
Even women?
There aren't any women here.
And you're all alone.
Suppose I take a look.
Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
Goodbye and thanks.
I tried my best, but these things take time.
And we're running out of that.
How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
He certainly could. About a month.
You're not giving up?
Maybe I better start working on him.
Go on. Have another try at him.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
Everybody knows --
Clay Phillips.
How far up the trail?
We got to get movin'.
Because there's a man I want to see.
We got company. Female company.
Why, yes. They're all I need...
What are you doin' --
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
Would you like to learn them?
I sure would.
You're so nice.
Good night, Miss Wells.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
Aren't we stayin'?
What comes after Z?
That's the end of the line.
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
No.
How about California?
You were supposed to be reading words.
She was only teasin'.
Oh, sure.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
Hey, Brenda.
Me, too. 101?
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
My favorite memory was when we --
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Really? That's amazing.
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
Cindy, what's going on?
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
Hello Brenda.
Ray, have you been here all this time?
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
He's right. I should go first.
Hey, you left your book back there.
So, I see you're really into spooks.
No. I never date outside my race.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Hi Buddy.
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
Sure. We can practice talking.
Dude, somebody's on the rag.
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Where the hell are we?
It looks like the furnace.
Can you feel that?
Feel that?
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Cindy, let me...
There's something I really want to share with you.
I know, but I've been thinking --
I know, but I've been thinking --
Listen to me I --
Listen to me I --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Then what are we going to do?
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
What should we get?
I don't care. You pick.
Okay, I get the point.
So, whatever happened to her?
Let her go, Cin.
But he'll kill her!
It's the sequel.
How about these buns?
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
I'm Cindy.
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
Stop touching his brain!
Stop! --
This can't be happening?
Noooo!!!
What are we gonna do?
Father!
My child, you're alive!
Yes, we made it!
My child you are the only survivor.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
So, do you think you made it into the class?
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
Gear. You know, clothing.
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
Yo! That jacket is tight.
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
Aww, the little bird died.
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
That was a great idea, Shorty.
Did you do that?
Hey, y'all! What's going on?
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.
I take it you're not mad at me.
I don't like this, this...
Saw who?!
I finished all the interviews.
Let me see the files.
Let me help you.
Here you go, Professor.
I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
In about fifteen minutes.
Right. What about condoms?
Would you please focus?
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
Professor, I think you should see this.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
The image there.
Professor, we need to talk.
Hello Dwight.
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?
And sexy.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
She's right. We should stick together.
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
Alright... I might need your help.
A little bit... Give me your belt.
You're not wearing a belt.
Uh... I'm Father McFeely
It's okay. I understand.
Would you like to see the girl?
Yes.
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
No thanks.
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
Sorry, y'all. My bad.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
I woke up naked, too.
What does it say?
It says, "Ray."
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
Get out?! What does it say?
"Fucked me."
"Ray!"
"Fucked me."
"Ray!"
BLOOD FEAST!
Hi, Mom.
Oh, boy! 
Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.
Did you hear?
Mrs. Sutphin?
Mother? 
0h, shit!
You don't think...
...Jenner... Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson. 3511 Clark Avenue!
Bring her home... I guess.
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
Here we go again.
Hi!
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her!  Should she be the next victim?
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?
Carl's a jerk!
No comment!
Sorry, ma'am.
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
Why?
Because it's the rules!
Chip, honey?
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
I'm so happy I could shit.
CHIP!!
In here, Mom...
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
You mean for TV or print?
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
You've been working in that video shop too long.
She's gonna kill Scotty!
Hi, Hank.
Chip, your ride is here.
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
Goodnight, honey.
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
We can be real quiet...
I love that you're my wife.
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
Oohhhh, Eugene!
Shhhh..
Oooohhhh.
Don't wake the kids...
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house. 
Contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
"P" as in...
Objection! Argumentative!
Hello.
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
I beg your pardon?
What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
It's not fair!!
What did you just say?
Dottie! Watch what you're doing!
Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
So you do drink?
Socially... I'll have a beer.
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
State your name, please.
Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
Who wants fruit salad?
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... 
And who may I ask is Carl?
He killed people, Mom.
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
Yes... but... I didn't...
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
Mrs... Sutphin?
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
Man, that one made me puke!
You forgot something...
Are we leaving?
SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
Murder, honey.
What was that?
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
What's he know?
Yes, ma'am, it is.
I'll give you fifty cents.
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
You know who I am, August?
You think my sister is there?
You can't tell.
I don't like this.
You scared?
Yes.
Let's get out of here.
It's only a little way, Mr. August.
We can't stand here all night.
Drink.
I've come from Jacqueline. She needs money.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
How much does she want?
She could use a hundred dollars.
I haven't got that much in cash.
How much have you got?
Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
But tell me --
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
Why, Mary --
Hello, Frances.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
She's a pretty good sort.
Do you know what this is, Frances?
What did she want?
I did her hair.
What were you talking about?
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
And that was all?
What did she want to know?
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
Thank you.. .goodnight.
But you do believe me?
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
The people at the restaurant?
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -
 What have you done about Irving August?
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
I know  I shouldn't have told you
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
Do you think he knows about this?
Let her know what?
She'll have to know some time.
Who are you?
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
And then?
I don't know.
You'll be all right?
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
I have been at the library.
Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
My window - - through which I see the world.
I have to go -
I had begun to write again -that's whet I was doing when you came in.
It's because of Jacqueline  I can't go on looking for her --
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
And the other was Judd?
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
Following me to find Jacqueline?
And this poetry  like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
Wait - there is that other favor.
Tell me where Jacqueline is - we've got to find her.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets.
Would they hurt her?
I haven't said anything of the sort.
But you would like to know where she is?
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
Is it about Jacqueline?
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
I'm afraid not.
Yes.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
I'll be out in a minute.
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
That makes it all the more difficult 
Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
But she told him, Frances. She told him about us.
I have taken care of Mary. I've spoken to her. She's going back to school.
Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell -
Yes?
False alarm.
Television?
Yes.
No. Why?
Oh, uh-huh.
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
Nine years.
This food is excellent.
Mother, father, sister.
Sister older or younger?
I don't know.
What's the first?
Would you mind?
No.
So what about kids?
Kids? What about them?
You're what?
Impotent.
My therapist said that --
You're in therapy?
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
You had sex with you therapist?
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
Hi!
Are you in the middle of something?
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
What are these?
It's a personal project I'm working on.
Who's Donna?
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
You went out with her?
Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.
All of these are interviews?
Yes.
Can we look at one?
No.
What... what are these interviews about?
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
About sex?
Yes.
What about sex?
You just ask them questions?
Yes.
And they just answer them?
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
I don't... why... why do you do this?
I'm sorry this came up.
This is just... so...
Maybe you want to go.
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
I know.
You know?
Yes.
How did you know?
She said it on her tape.
Do you think that's such a good idea?
Don't you want to make one?
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
What do you have to do to get ready?
What will you do when the money runs out?
It won't. Are you ready?
Tell me your name.
Tell me your name.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Do you talk to him?
When we're making love?
Yes.
Sometimes. Afterward.
Is he going to see this?
I guess not.
So you do fantasize?
Yes.
About who?
I fantasized about you.
About me?
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
No.
On tape?
No.
You said you weren't always impotent.
So you have had sex.
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
So you lied to her?
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
Interesting analogy.
I'm babbling.
No, you're not.
God, I m so mad at him!!
You're really never going to make love again?
If you were in love with me, would you?
I'm not in love with you.
But if you were?
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
I can't.
Why not?
I've told you.
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
Who? Elizabeth?
No.
But you're planning to be?
Not entirely.
Yes.
Like maybe a big part?
Don't do that.
Why not?
I want to touch you.
Graham...
Yes. I just got busy.
Something wrong?
But I'm not.
I'm not either!!
Where did you go when you left here?
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
Goddam right.
Bastard...
You son of a bitch!!
I have thought about it, yes.
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
What do you mean?
Did you masturbate?
God, no.
So it was recently that you tried this.
Is he still at your house?
No, he left last week.
Did you find him attractive?
What do you mean, like physically?
Do you want to leave therapy?
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
Ann, you always underestimate me.
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
He doesn't have a phone.
Well, I'll call him when he does.
But he won't.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
Will you stop? Jesus.
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
No, I didn't.
No, it's nothing like that.
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
Well, what, then?
I don't want to talk about it.
He just asked me questions.
What kinds of questions?
Questions about sex.
Yes, I did.
Cynthia!
Why did you do that?
Because I wanted to.
But why did you want to?
He wouldn't do that.
You don't know that for sure.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
Did he touch you?
In front of him, Ann, yes.
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
Here it is.
What is it?
It's a sun dress.
It looks like a tablecloth.
I was just trying to --
Bye.
I wish you'd get an answering machine.
There's a phone here.
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
Do I know you?
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
You want me to leave?
Nope.
How did you find me?
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
Doing what?
Talking.
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
You just want to ask me questions?
I just want to ask you questions.
And that's all?
Would anybody else see the tape?
How do we start?
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
And you ask questions, right?
Yes.
No.
Do I sit or stand?
Whichever you prefer.
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
What did he say?
He said that my hand felt good.
Would you like me to take my pants off?
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Yes.
Yes.
Prettier than Ann?
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
Is that what he tells you?
No.
No? Not even one more?
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
I can't talk you into it?
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
I've got to get back to the office.
Who said I was jealous?
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
No, I mean doing it at my house.
I'm intrigued.
John?
Hello.
Cynthia. John.
Not today. I've got other plans.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
How about inviting me over to dinner?
You know what I mean.
John Millaney.
When?
Nothing wrong with trying.
Do you want me to stop calling?
What's so stupid about it?
I like the way he dresses.
I wish you hadn't done that.
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
I just... Ann is very...
It won't. I trust him.
Look, are we going to do it or not?
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
God, you... you're mean.
I know. Will you please leave now?
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
Plenty of room for two people.
Student?
No.  You said three-fifty?
Plus first and last month deposit.
Will you lease month-to-month?
Not for three-fifty.
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
Really. How'd it go?
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
I like having the car, the car is important.
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
Hi, John.
Where are the tapes, Graham?
Give me your keys.
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
IBM.
May I ask who's calling?
John Millaney.
Mr. Millaney?
Mr. Millaney?
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
He said immediately.
Hi.
C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.
No, nothing.
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
Kiss, kiss?
Anything wrong?
No. I don't think so.
Well? Supper at my place?
But where are you going?
Can I call you at the office?
What do you want to call me at the office for?
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
Want me to breathe deeply?
Didn't seem worried about them.
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
Gonna cut me open?
That you, Rog?
It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
He didn't make it.
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.

YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME
BREAKING OUT

BREAKING OUT
You bet, Bert.
How's Brad?
A wreck.
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
Sank you!  Velcome!  Sank you!
What?
Infantile regression.
You got it!
I know, I know, it's just...
Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
SIN-I-FUL
Dear old Bert's settled everything.
How did you come by this scenario?
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
SPONSOR!!!
We're the experts.
Out of self comes selflessness.
Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview.
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
Yes, Betty.
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
Care to indulge?
Indulge?
President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?
I'll leave you young things to it.
Shove it, Ralph!
I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EACH OTHER
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR IMPROVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT
YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
Mental instability?
He was adopted you know.
Oh, Harry.  What are we going to do?
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
Could you tell us a little about it?
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
Could I do that later?
But they only think they're happy.
Oh my poor baby.
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
You shouldn't have said that.
Why?
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
I'm sorry, Officer.
I NEED SOME
I NEED SOME
YOUNG BLOOD
I NEED SOME
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.

It's you we're concerned about, Janet.

This could be worse than the old series.
Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
And none of them worked?
Isn't she lovely?
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
She walks in beauty...
We love you, Baby.
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
The fuck was that?
It's Christine.  Hey you.
Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
Well, then put him at the singles table.
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
Why are you being so defensive?
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
Bye.
I love you.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
Are you there? Miles?
So I guess that's it.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
Highliner.
Glass or bottle?
Bottle.
You got it.
You okay, Miles?
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.
They're just leftovers.
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Stephanie.
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
Good. How're you?
Great. You look great.  You both do.
I'm thinking about the duck breast.
What happened to you guys?
Highliner, please.
Are you a writer too?
No, I'm an actor.
Anything I'd know?
That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
No, we're paying for the wine.
I can't help the traffic.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
Don't open that now. It's warm.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
How old's she going to be?
Um... seventy... something.
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
Let me call Christine.
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
What do you smell?
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
That's what you do with every one.
You know, you could work in a wine store.
Are you chewing gum?
Hey Jack, hurry up!
It does. Feels right.
Then it's a good thing.
Yeah. Tight.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
Sure I know Maya.
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
And she likes Pinot.
She works for tips!
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
Have you no shame?
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Nice, huh?
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
She what?  When?
About a month ago. Six weeks.
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
Get the trunk.
We're on.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Pull yourself together, man.
Where were you?
Bathroom.
Oh, boy.
She's been leaving messages here too.
You should call her.
I will.  See ya!
Right now.
What'd Christine say?
Hey, there you are.
Yep.
Where is Stephanie?
What?
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
What? Of course I like Christine.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
Nice shot.
What do you think's going on?
Been checking your messages?
Obsessively.
What is it?
Fucker hit into us.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
Is what the money thing?
We're on.
What exactly are we going to do?
I said okay?
What?
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
Do you like them?
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
Let me use your phone.
Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
Huh. Let me think.
What's it look like to you?
You know what I'm thinking?
Fucking chick's married.
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
We gotta go back.
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
So what's the plan?
The plan is... you go.
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
Hey, Jack. Jack.
Come on, let me drive.
What's wrong?
What the fuck!
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
Well. That about does it.
Why don't you come in?
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
You want to join us?
I finished it.
What are you drinking?
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Oh yeah? How is it?
Nice. Very nice.
Twelve months in oak.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
I'm having the salmon.
Are you all right?
Hi.
Hey.
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
What was the bottle that did it?
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
What's the title?
"The Day After Yesterday."
Oh. You mean... today?
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
Yeah? Like what?
Bathroom over there?
Good. So did I.
Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
I had class.
Well, nice to see you now.
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
About two-thirty.
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Oh, Maya. No.
Hello?
Victoria.
Victoria! How the hell are you?
Ken.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.
That was big of him.
That's great.
So what's happening with your book?
Not me. I'm not drinking.
You quit drinking?
How much skin and stem contact?
About a year.
French or American?
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
Sir, what are you doing?
I told you I need a drink.
Oops. Sorry.
See you, Miles. You take care.
Only for pee or poop.
It makes me feel better.
Does she ever answer back?
No.
There's dust in it.
This one?
A hair.
Daddy.
I think it's contaminated.
My ballet recital.
The same windows.
I don't want you to die.
I'm scared.
Hi sweetie.
Does it hurt?
I don't feel much.
...I will.
...Tell Graham --
And tell Merrill to swing away.
Explain, act crazy?
Curse and stuff.
I'm not going to curse.
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Just make noises then.
I cursed.
It was very dark.
It was very dark.
This guy got on the roof in like a second.
Morgan, be careful.
How can you say that?
Do you feel comforted?
Yes.
What time is it?
Where are you going?
This is going to do nothing.
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
He was only a year and half old.
We won't be able to get out of there.
Merrill --
Merrill!
They're distracting us?
I can feel air.
Me too.
It's getting stronger.
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
That's good enough for me.
Don't touch him.
Graham.
Yes.
It needs batteries.
These are D's; I need double A's.
It's still making the noises. It's broken.
I'm getting out now.
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
Bimboo?
Dad.
What's two?
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
Where are we going to sleep?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Stop crying!
Did someone save me?
It's the strangest thing Father.
Don't call me Father.
The footprints.
Second thing this week I can't explain.
He definitely wasn't a midget.
Is anything missing?
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
She's not in an ambulance Father.
Is that him?
Don't do it!
It's like War of the Worlds.
Emmett! Am I glad to see you!
No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
What friend is that?
Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
I think we lost 'em.
Emmett.
I didn't know you were out.
Where were you?
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
...Gotta go...
Where are we?
You'll never make it.
I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
I almost didn't.
Where's Jake?
McKendrick's men got him.
Gotta go.
The Parkers seem like nice folks.
They've been kind to me.
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
Are you all right?
This is a brutal land.
You must have known that before you came.
You're not Baxter?
My name is Emmett.
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
Offend anybody lately?
Jefferson City?
Where's Turley?
I gotta be going.
Going to Turley, was it?
It's a town...
I expect.
Women?
Doesn't look quite fair.
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
No hard feelings.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
You haven't got any money.
I'll see you around.
You might make a farmer yet.
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
The other guy drew first.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
We didn't get that far.
What now?
Where's your brother?
He is now.
All I did was kiss the girl.
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
New record.
What are you talking about?
I'm done talking. Get out.
You can't do this.
What's all this then?
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
Now let's talk about you chaps.
The jury saw it differently.
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
He was murdered.
It's none of your business.
Rae, all we got is each other.
Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
Rae, I need help.
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
What makes you think I could?
Why would they stop you?
Why are they doing this, Mal?
What about his brother?
I heard that too.
Hello, Cobb.
I see you're prospering without me.
It's been a while.
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
You've got a legitimate job.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
You got a place to stay?
What brings you into my saloon?
Nothing like that will happen between us.
I took out thirteen dollars.
This is a lot of money.
It is that.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
What is it you want from me?
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
I'm going to have to look into this.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
Stella.
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
And I know what I'm talking about.
You like a good saloon?
It's the only place I'm happy.
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
Who's the owner?
What's this?
That's the good stuff.
You really are a gambler.
What is it that I can't figure?
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
How about you?
I don't want you to get hurt.
I've got a place I can hide her.
I wouldn't worry about that.
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
Okay -- for you.
I'm glad we talked.
-- Do you know what these are, Elaine?
So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
Almost right.
I can't wait to meet her.
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.
There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... "instrument".
Hair and make-up?
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
What about it?
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Even the fall from the plane?
Even the fall from the plane.
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
Everyone you know is lying.
-- You can't go in there!
So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.
Viktor, you should have said something.
She doesn't want pity.
... Simone.
As a matter-of-fact I am.
When is she coming over?
About now.  Would you like a drink?
Is Simone back to earth yet?
I just read somewhere --
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?
Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you.
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
Hello?
Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
Thank Simone for the tickets.
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.
So you did meet her?
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a liability.
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
Of course.
You look so, so...
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
What?... What did you say?
Do what you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Yes, call me Simone.
You're with me to be close to her?
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
Body double.
You can't.
Why not?
There's... a wall between you --
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
Is she here?
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
I'm sorry.
You have to see her.
I've seen them all before.
Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
-- We call them "vactors".
I need flesh and --
You do?
"Straw God" changed my life.
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a minute?  What brings you here tonight?
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
Hi, Dad.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important.
Hi, Dad.
She still with Kent?
Is she here tonight?
Can't you stop that?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
I do.
How?
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
Okay, Dad.
-- I know, I don't know anything.
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
One thing bothered me.
Good-night, Daddy.
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
I do okay.  How about you?
Really?  Too bad.
Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
I love you, Lainey.
Why didn't she thank you?
Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it?
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.
About you and mom?
Do I know you?
It's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
I've done my homework.  I've studied her.
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
You love her, don't you, Max?
Don't you?
Is it a jamming device?
Why?
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
My God, you've got one?
Mr. Sayer...
It's a hotel.
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
Would you like me to read?
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
Good.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
Simone, are you there?
Let's take it down a notch.
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
A star is...
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
The only real truth is in the work.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
--My God.
Why did you leave me?
Goodnight, Malcolm.
Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
All your soldiers speak Latin?
I forgot your name.
Dr. Crowe.
You use needles?
No.
I'm going to see you again, right?
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.
Where should I look then, Cole?
He hates me.
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
You said the "s" word.
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
What about Mrs. Marschal?
...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
What'd you write?
Words.
What kind of words?
That isn't magic.
I didn't know you were funny.
Dr. Crowe.
What makes you think that?
Cats?
Can I ask you then?
What do you want more than anything?
I don't know.
I told you what I want.
When?
Dr. Crowe?
Yes.
Something happened, didn't it?
Yes, it did.
Are you wigging out?
No, we're not.
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
Really?
And you know what else?
What?
They're right here.
What are you thinking, Momma?
Lots of things.
You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
Don't get mad.
I'd give anything to have been there.
Communicate?
Yeah.
Someone got hurt.
They did?
A lady. She died.
Where is she?
Cole, you're scaring me.
They scare me too sometimes.
They?
Dead people.
Dead people?
You see ghosts, Cole?
They want me to do things for them.
What are you thinking, Momma?
...I don't know.
She wanted me to tell you--
Yes, Cole?
Like what?
I don't know how else to look--
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!
S-ssstop that!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering--
...He doesn't get invited places.
Chuck E. who?
What are you talking about?
'Course, it's none of my business.
Could take a little while, though.
What's a "little while?"
Nope.
Get off his case sweetie.
Fuck you.
Bitch.
Slut.
Witch.
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
Bitch.
Someone actually... employs you?
I happen to be a professional.
Hi.
...Hi.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
Aha. The Lovers.
Looks like the alternator.
Dammit, Carl!!!!
Carl, what are you doing?
Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
Sounds familiar.
Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!
I could. You sucked.
Hey. Fuck you.
Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
"Peggy-Sue" --
Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!
Curt Cobain.
Well, there goes our record deal.
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.
So... what does it do?
Should we be doing this, dude?
"Old Macdonald... had --"
"With a hack-hack here --"
He means moon shining.
Harvest moonshining!
Carl! Oh Carrrrl!
How... was she "called?"
This is his room... isn't it?
You'll be back.
You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
Sure. What do you want to know.
-- It's not me!
It's time to make amends.
Throw me one.
-- And keep your eyes on the road.
Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
Ow!
Who? Us?!
Down boy.
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here I come!
What the fuck you talking about, man?
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
Chicken sandwich?
Name something.
Then why go back now?
What about Jeremiah?
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
You wouldn't understand.
What are --
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
Suzie... No.
No Mac, please... I --
Mac... let's get out of here.
Get out of here.
...no... Mac... p-please...
Hey. Anyone here need lessons, just talk to me.
What is it?!!
Like your guitar break.
Carl.
Someone better tell Mac.
Shit.
Bill, we need to talk!
That's not funny.
Sorry.
What you up to?
Grant, where'd you go?
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
That wasn't a good night, no.
You took Bill.
It's my nature.
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
Where are you?!
He's a fucking Martian?!
What the hell are we going to do?!
Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
Are you nodding?
I got to leave my post.
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
Who's the lucky fella?
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
You're lookin' awful pretty.
Where's the old half--Mexican?
Flip.
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
I never danced in a towel before.
My present?
You're my princess, aren't you?
What are you doing?
I'll get if for you.
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
Grant, no!
I loved you. I loved --
Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
When one sees you they all see you.
Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
Get your hands off my daughter!
Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
Last year, this was a new rig.
How much style?
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
You got my barley pop?
Why're you driving so fast?
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
But you could get killed, right?
A what?
So tell me about yourself.
Having fun.
Is this fun?
Driving?
Driving, talking to me...
You have a great profile.
Seriously?!?
Guess what?
I give up.
Can I ask you something?
You know, you're not a bad driver.
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
Well?
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
Hey...
See ya, Kate.
What the hell are you doing?!?
By stealing my car?
Mississippi's the other way!
Let's hit it.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
An unmarked police car.
How do you know?
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
I'm proud of you.
-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.
What kind of a guy is he?
What are you gonna do when you get home?
Why are you stopping?
Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
Well, thanks for the lift.
What are you thinking?
See ya, Bandit.
Yes.
But you'll do it?
What's your pleasure?
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
Order up!
Cledus.
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
No.
Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
How long's this gonna take?
Also boring.
What are you doin' now?
Bandit?
Yeah?
Why are we doing this?
Hit the brakes!
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
We still on schedule?
I hate to say I told you so.
Save it. We got a long haul.
Bandit I, do you copy?
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
Bandit?
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
Do I have a choice?
What's your twenty?
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
I'm at marker eight-five.
I ran into complications.
I hate to say it...
We're gone.
Never mind. It's nothing.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
Now what?
We're outta motion lotion.
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
Just fine. What's the weather like?
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
-- How we doing?
Bandit II?
You're coming up to the scale house.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
Breaker. Breaker.
Go head on, breaker.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Breaker. Breaker.
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
Have any trouble getting here?
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
This is Bandit I. Over.
Shut up, Fred.
I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
Yes, ma'am.
Bandit two, you read me?
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
That's the point, Dickey.
Now, you just find him, son.
Five thou.
That crazy sumbitch made it.
-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
Is your security team armed?
Of course. Yes.
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
How bad?
Mortal.
No.
Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
Did he give you his name?
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
You shot me and murdered my friends.
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
And threw us into the lake.
Mmm-hmm.
But there were more of you?
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
...I forgive you Darwin.
I've got concerns.
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
I'm here, where's the car?
Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
D'you talk to'm?
I said I got his machine.
No, what did you say on the machine?
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
...I'm sorry...
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
I am. Yeah.
Without peer?
Fifty grand gouge. South shore hayseeds, this is why I never play Tahoe, or redneck Reno...
FUCK YOU!
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
Where's Israel?
What are you doing here?
My debrief --
-- will be handled back in --
I can't discuss --
-- You can and you will.
...So you made another deal?
You're trying to save Sparazza?
No... We're trying to save Heller.
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Yeah... Sid?
You got clicks, anything?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
That's the punchline, y'ready?
Shoot.
A million flat.
No shit.
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Right, you got clicks, anything?
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
I'm working on it.
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
-- never in a million girl --
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
True?
Like a mafucka.
What were you doin' here anyway?
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
What!?
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
What's wrong?
Gibarian.
I can trust Rheya.
You'll end up like me.
You're not Gibarian...
What happened to Gibarian?
Didn't you talk to Snow?
Where's his body?
In the lab.  With her, probably.
No.  There's no behavior modification.
Yes.
You killed her!
She'll come back.
You fucking bastard...
What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
He's dead.
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
He'll let me in.
Is there anybody else here?
Why, who did you see?
Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
How much sleep do you need?
How much sleep?
Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
My wife.
Probably.
I wish you'd told me.
What will you say?
Kelvin, you awake?
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
Perhaps it did.
They come when you sleep.
What happened?
What plan?
Her oxygen would have run out.
What's wrong with you?  We need your help.
Oh, God.  I'm awake.
I need to see Snow.
I'll go with you.
Don't.
I don't know.  I can't be alone.
To calm your anxiety.
We're taking a flight?
Not a very happy poem.
You didn't look very happy.
I wasn't.
And tonight?
Let's go home.
What do you remember?
Is it intelligent?
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
Then it's God, right?
It's something.
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
What happened to us, exactly?
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
Yes.  Yes.
What's wrong.
You don't love me.
Sartorius.
Why did she do it?
You... she said I didn't love her.
Was she right?
No.  I love you.
You're the coward.
You don't want me.
But that's what happened before.
Do you want to stay here?
Do you?
What's wrong?
Gibarian.  He was here.
You said he was dead.
What's happening to us?
How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
Rheya --
I'm disgusting.
No.
You should have told me.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
Neither did I.
I never said I didn't.
Chris --
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
I want you here.
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
I want to stop taking those pills.
I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
What are you taking?
What does it want?
Where did you go before?
He won't do it.
Why do you say that?
Followed by non-human manifestations.
Snow, get up here, now.
Claire!
They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
You didn't like him?
It's terrific Win.
I've never seen anyone killed before.
Right.  That's true.
Can we go then?
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
You live in Manhattan?
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
Would you pick one out, please?
Put it on my account, please.
You can touch me, I won't bite.
Hey!  There are crazy people here.
Let's get a drink.
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
You all right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Sooner, the better.
He said he'd kill me.
Claire?
Urdu and Hindi.
Didn't do very well, did you?
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
You were reading my Renoir.
So, this could be your last night, huh?
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
So it was "love".
Yeah.  It was.
No dog.
But "nice".
You don't like him, do you?
What's to like?
Tell it like it is.
You could do better.
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
Good night, Mike.
Claire?
Open the door, will you?
You put me life in danger.
Stop, will you?!
Let go!
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
I don't know you...
You told her?
Oh God, that's great!
Oh that thing in Queens.
Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
What a memory.
Do you?
Pretty bad.
It wouldn't work.
I'd miss my life...
How long you going away for?
"For"...?
Claire!
Everyone's all right...?
So.
You still going away?
I don't know...
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
You're planning to speak?
Not if you don't want me to.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
Keep what handy?
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
Tommy...!
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
Mike?
What?
My ass if falling.
Your what...?
My ass is falling.  It is.
I can still use a gun.
I think television's a dangerous thing.
Hey.  The neighbors.
Oh, some shit.
What shit, honey?
She's got to identify him.
I think -- she's crazy.
I'd identify him.
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
Bought it.
It's not your taste.
What did she say the down payment was?
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
I had to follow her to a store.
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
Ellie, it was a formal party...
She bought it.
Coming to bed?
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
What was that?
I'm sorry.
I watched TV.
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.
Ellie...
Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as good a job.
But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
At my house...!
Koontz!  I need you guys!
You in this with me?
Not Koontz.
Wasn't your fault.
Tell me I'm dreamin'.
Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman.
Ever shot anyone?
Yes.
Does it make you... hard?
Are you in charge here?
I asked for the man in charge...
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
You're here 'til what time?
You should'a brought the girl.
Hold it...!
Why should she come in?
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
Let my kid go.
Watch your step!
What're we having?
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!
Nice threads Dad.
How are things going, pal?
Okay, I guess.
How about dinner tonight?
Mom and I got plans.
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
She's taking singing lessons.
Shooting.
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
I don't think she can sing, either.
Well, look who's dressing for success.
And Flash isn't?
Peter-- you took this picture?
Here you go, Pete.
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
What, want a glass?
So, uh... how's college goin'?
Remember Little League?
I know.
I was there.
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
Flash, get lost.
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
What's in there?
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
Jesus Christ.
You get mugged or something?
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Now tell me you love me.
Lemme down, bugface!
Are you okay?
Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Can't focus...
Would you cool it already?
Frmpph-yrr.
What's this? A cockaroach?
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
How about tomorrow?
You're making my life difficult.
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
He knew.
Some things you should say anyway.
What if you get hurt?
Good morning, Liz.
How very dull, Peter Parker.
I-- uh--
Uh is a good start.
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
I hate the Platonic idea of you.
I hate people with alliterative names.
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
God, Flash can be such a jerk.
But you like that in a man?
Some prep school thing.
I'd never admit that.
I've gotta study.
Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
What's your problem?
Sit down and stop being such a child.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
Do you mind if I come too?
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
Peter?
You sure about all this?
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
It's Friday night...
The record--
What the hell is that?
Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
A match made in heaven.
Peter, you're bleeding.
It's fine.  Tell me what--
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
No.  No thank you.  I have work.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
Peter, what can I do for you?
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
Your dog ate it.
Actually, I got this spider bite
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -
Luck.  The right place at the right time.
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
Why? It is a wrestling match, or
Where'd you get the clown suit?
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
Bonkers.
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
Up here, Docky Ocky!
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
What's wrong with him?
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
Jawohl.
Is you all little Adolfs?
We made a deal with Barrack One.
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
Come on!
Ready?
Roger.
Coming up.
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
And maybe a little something else?
Have a cigar.
Put me down for ten, you louse.
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
How much more do we have to take from him?
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
Not you.
What some brandy?
You won't get off that cheap.
Let's blow, Chauncey.
I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
What is your number?
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
It is.
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Interesting.
Say, Schulz --
Jawohl?
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Jawohl.
What is this? This is water?
It's a mouse trap.
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
You can say that again!
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
Let me go! Let me go!
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
You want Betty Grable!
Let me go!
What's the award?
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Me? What if she don't want me?
You're teasing me again!
No, Animal.
Easy, Animal! Easy!
Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
So what? There's other women!
You'll fix me up!
To the Brick Kremlin!
She'll never forgive me!
What do those broads say?
What do they always say?
That's what I wanna hear.
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
Grable, not Gable!
Do Grable.
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
I'll open mine now.
Let me alone.
You're crying, Animal.
May I have this dance, Miss?
Let me do it, Hoffy.
You want to go?
Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is, he's sure batting a thousand.
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
What about Schulz?
We've all done a poor job of it.
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
Stay out of it, Sefton.
Anybody call?
Says who?
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
What's the matter, boys? Is my slip showing?
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
You starting that again?
Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?
How do they know?
You told them, Hoffy.
You did!
You could use a new one yourself.
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
Nothing for Kuzawa?
Shapiro. Shapiro.
When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
Ach so!
No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
December seventh, forty-one.
What time?
Schulz, you're off your nut!
Give me the radio.
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
Ich weiss alles.
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
Who's the guy, Schulz?
I do not want those cigarettes.
I'll make it five hundred!
Talk what? I do not know anything!
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
This is me in Cincinnati.
From a chicken, bug-wit.
Is it all right if we smell it?
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.
Have a nice time over there?
So you're stuck with me, eh?
Toh-pak-cha=8A 
The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
It's working.
Target their Bridge.
This is its current position.
Population?
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
I get it. I get it.
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
We're within range, sir.
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
Soran?
All of us.
Where is he now?
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
Why would you want to leave?
Can I?
Yes, where would you go?
No, no. Thank you.
We don't have a tractor beam.
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
That's right.
Close to retirement?
I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
And what would that be, sir?
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
But I do have a theory...
A photon torpedo?
Keep her together until I get back.
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
Sir?
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
Is there a problem?
Sir, is there anything wrong?
Captain, are you all right?
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
You must think I'm quite the madman.
We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
It looks like we're too late.
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
Transwarp at your command, Sir!
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
Put me on the hailing frequency.
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
You did great, Bones... Just great.
Response?
What did you see, Chekov?
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
Aye sir, coding now.
Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
I don't believe it...
Hello, sir. It's David.
David!... What went wrong?
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
Same sector. Metallic mass.
Underground deposit?
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
I'll handle that later.
.          .. Spock's tube...
What is it?
Later. Let's go...
Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
That may be difficult...
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
Not exactly.
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
This planet is aging in surges.
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
Sir...?
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
How many more?
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
The Genesis planet is gone.
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
My God...
I know you... Do I not?
You would have done the same for me.
On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.
... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
I think it's an energy form, sir...
... A cloaking device?
About a dozen officers and men.
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
What about surface life signs...?
Close... There --
We are clear and free to navigate.
The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.
No, sir, no response.
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
Gentlemen. Good evening.
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Welcome aboard, Admiral.
Where's Doctor McCoy?
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.

There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
No.
But, why?
Genesis, I want it.
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
... He spoke of your friendship.
... The needs of the many outweigh...
... The needs of the few...
... Or the one.
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
Share this with no one.
Success, my lord.
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
Range: 3000 Kellicams.
Firing range, sir.
1,000 Kellicams, closing!
500 Kellicams!
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
You amaze me, Commander.
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
You're not going in there -- !
Physician, heal thyself.
That's all you have to say?
Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
Twenty-two, eighty-three...
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
Say thank you.
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
And who am I hiding from?
Shore leave, Admiral.
What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Now that's what I call a meal.
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?
... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --
Jim... read me? Can you read me?
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
... Can't read you... repeat...
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
Carol!
How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy.
David --
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
Are you sure these are the coordinates?
You're crazy -- !
I saw it -- !
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
But the child --
A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering --
He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?
Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
Where's Dr. Marcus --
Why didn't you tell me?
It's a long story.
It's the Genesis Wave!
How soon --
We encoded four minutes --
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
I don't mean to intrude.
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
Is that what you came here to say?
Let go -- he can't -- !
What are you looking at?
The Admiral's son.
Don't you believe it.
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
Let them eat static.
Sir -- our shields are dropping!
They won't --
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
Tactical!
Inoperative.
Yours... is... the superior...
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
Time's up, Admiral...
Aye, sir.
We'll be going to warp speed --
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
Just barely, sir.
Uhura. Can't you augment?
She's not responding...
Try the emergency channels...
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Mr. Scott on discrete.
On screen.
... No response, sir.
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
Give the word, Admiral.
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
Meaning you can't even beam us back?
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
And who is this?
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
Is the word given?
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
It literally is Genesis...
The power of creation --
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
They knew just where to hit us.
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Not enough against their shields.
The prefix code?
Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's  inside the station.
... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
What IS working around here?
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
The ship -- out of danger?
... the good of the few...
In my quarters, Uhura.
Permission to speak candidly, sir?
And why not?
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
You earned it.
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
Yes.
This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.
Khan!
Reliant's command...
Indeterminate life signs.
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
Hold your course. Look sharp...
Mr. Saavik, all stop.
Cease fire. Look sharp.
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
Time from my mark...
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Time!
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
Understood, sir.
Admiral on the bridge!
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Stop engines.
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
I can't get power, sir!
Admiral on the bridge --
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
We are clear and free to navigate.
Prepare for warp speed.
Fire all phasers...!
He's not what I expected, Sir.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
All moorings are clear, Captain.
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
Certainly...
You lied.
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
To Earth. To offer testimony.
You do this -- for friendship?
How're you doing?
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
No!  No... What did you have in mind...?
You sure this is such a bright idea?
It'll come back to him.
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
-- That's the general idea.
An experimental device, doctor.
Wake up, man, wake up!
Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.
Hi... Busy?
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
That is what I said, Doctor.
Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
... Best shot...?
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
You're saying... It is a compliment.
We're just -- observing.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Can you isolate the wave?
Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please...
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
Name?
No, <u>my</u> name.
You play games with me and you're through
Go ahead. Stun me.
Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
Shields, Mr. Chekov.
No choice now, Scotty!
Ah, well done, team 2.
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.
Can you protect us?
I suppose they told you that...?
So you were at Berkeley.
You sure you won't change your mind?
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
We don't want to be any trouble.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
They're gonna hafta take their chances.
Just a little joke. See you later, old friend.
Do you trust me?
Just lucky, I guess.
You're upset about losing the whales.
... You're very perceptive.
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
Where could you take them?
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
What's that?
Wanna try it from the top?
... Who are you?
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
Here... In the park?
Steady, now. We need your help.
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
Kirk. They're gone.
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
You tricked me.
Oh my God, we're too late!
You mean this is -- goodbye?
Thank you, Admiral.
Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
Mr. Spock, your computations?
In progress, Admiral.
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
What is our target in time?
The late 20th Century.
You've programmed that from memory...?
Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
How do you know this...?
Spock...
I cannot tell a lie.
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
The tank will be finished by morning...
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
Admiral. Full power is restored.
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
They did, Admiral.
Warp two... three...
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
... Aye sir...?
Ready sir.
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Three-one-zero, aye!
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
I have no control, sir!
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
What is it?
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
Nothing... I should never have left him...
Uhura!... Where!
Bearing!
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
Estimate range, ship to whales!
Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.
I can't, sir -- Nothing!
Scotty, how long is this bay?
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?
How long, Scotty?
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
Full power, sir.
Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
The whales...?!
No power to the bay doors.
It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
I am well, Admiral.
We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
Professor Scott, if you'll --
With pleasure.
Well, that's different.
If you'll follow me, Professor --
I notice you're still working with polymers.
Hello? Computer...?
Just use the keyboard...
Transparent aluminum?
Hi.
Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
But not you.
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
... an offlander?
Mother and son. You arranged this...?
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
You're what?
I understand.
Don't you ever get tired?
Really?
Chase me!
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
Androids... don't have...fun.
No... I want to stay with you...
Can he breathe under water?
Data doesn't breathe.
Won't he rust?
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
Will he live?
She's stabilizing.
Is it safe to move her?
Hello, Data...
Captain, Geordi...?
Yes... that looks like them.
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
I'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation, Captain...
Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
I'll order Riker to turn around.
It is not over.
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
Understood.
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
Do you know how to disable the injector?
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
May I talk to you alone?
They... are in opposite directions, sir...
We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.
The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
I don't believe it happened that way.
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
Implants bothering you?
A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
Will that stop the tear?
You got me, Commander.
Options?
The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
How long 'til they reach us?
I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...
We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
They're powering their forward weapons array.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
Who is it?
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
You must be planning on doing some hunting.
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
Would you like something to eat?
Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.
I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way...
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
One. It's Ru'afo.
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
What are they interested in...?
Wine, women and song.
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
What you're doing to my neck...
But it's comfortable.
Why don't you try sitting up?
Augh.
Initiate launch sequence.
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
Absolutely.
Good hunting. Hayes out.
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
There must be some good people... even in this time.
He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
Not yet.
How long has he been unconscious?
Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
I do not know what you are referring to.
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
Isn't it better like this...?
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
Vulcan?
Can you configure it?
I believe so.
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
I have helm control.
The vortex is collapsing, sir.
Who are you?
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
I told you, there's no --
What did you do to the batteries?
This must be it.
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.
Ready to make a little history?
No... the door's too thick.
Altitude fifty kilometers...
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
Active.
Main bus...
Ready.
Jean-Luc Picard.
Great name. French?
Yes.
Where are you from most recently?
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
You seem to have an answer for everything.
Something wrong with that?
What do you want?
The invasion plans.
There is no invasion...
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
"Money." So you can get dome money...
You're lying.
Were the two of you... involved?
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
Friends from Cornell...
Some.
I have to...
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
That's impossible.
Incoming transmission from the Borg.
Life signs?
Track their weapons fire.
Port battery, ready sir!
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
Target locked!
Report.
We're still in Earth orbit.
Looks like they damaged the silo...
Return to our own time?
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
Agreed. Options?
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
Are you alright?
Report!
We've lost Bridge control!
Emergency override!
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
They're bypassing Engineering...
I remember it made me sick.
Worf to Bridge.
Worf? Is something wrong?
What the hell happened down there, Worf?
Mr. President.
I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
I believe the operation is over.
You may need assistance, doctor...
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
Spock, that was actually funny.
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
Uh, Jim...
What the Hell's going on?
Thanks...
We're not finished.
- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
I didn't mean this future.
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
What is it with you, anyway?
Still think we're finished?
If they're even looking for us...
Damned clever if you ask me...
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
This is fun...
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
Are you carrying a surgeon?
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
Stand...?
I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
They'll make it look like an accident...
They'll respect him now...
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
Would you care to go topside?
You feign ignorance?
He just tried to save him!
I checked the data banks, yes.
And what did they tell you?
Are those your words?
Yes.
Spoken by you?
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
You were demoted...
Yes.
For insubordination.
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
Where is Mr. Sulu?
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
Torpedo room--?
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
From Starfleet?
She's here - somewhere.
Shields. Battle stations.
They're preparing to fire.
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet?
Aye, sir.
An INCIDENT?
Do we report this, sir?
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
I've heard of chameloids - "Shapeshifters" - I thought you were mythical.
Your friends are late...
What took you so long?
Kill him! He's the one!!
He's got it.
How did you know...?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
How much time's left of your sentence?
Except us.
I know how to get outside the shield.
Stand down your weapons.
This is incredible -
Aye, sir.
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
Kronos, sir?
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
I always wanted to try that.
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
I hope you're happy.
Sir?
Captain, our shields -- !
Just the prototype.
Sulu!
You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
When does this conference start?
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
They're dying.
Never been this close.
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
What is it?
I am uncertain.
What the -
The peace conference.
Why would they give them to us?
I was blind. I couldn't see past the death of my son. I couldn't trust.
But I am not human. I am only -
Close enough to beam down?
Control tower, reading, Sir.
Gorkon's own man??
Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...
Her own father...?
Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
A lie?
A lie?
If you are logical.
I don't want to.
Direct hit -
Trouble?
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
Sir?
You having hearing problems, mister?
According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
What is it?
Praxis?
At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -
It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
That could take hours!
And if they're still in place?
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time.
Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...
I don't think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.
Fuzzy face is gone.
Do you know who I am?
Do you know where you are?
Can you remember our father?
No.
Why?
Because you are dangerous.
I do not understand.
No. Can I move now?
No. I must deactivate you.
For how long?
Indefinitely.
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
Beverly, come in.
Not tonight, I have work here.
So... To happy endings.
Now, you make a toast.
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
He is very observant.
Data!
A bit less florid, Data.
A weapon.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
What do you imagine this is?
Do you think this is a wise course of action?
Ready, Captain.
Of you?
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
We are losing dorsal shields.
We are being hailed.
Negative.
You have a red shirt.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
It appears to be...  ... an arm.
It's you.
If you wouldn't mind.
May I have this dance?
I'm going to miss you.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
How can you be certain?
But how can he? He'll kill you.
Imzadi. This is so good.
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.

What do we know about the planet?
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
Sir?
Aye, sir.
Deanna, on my mark.
How long until he can fire?
Sir, we're being hailed.
New Praetor?
Understood.


Just lucky, Admiral.
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
So, human... you've met your better self!
I won't do it.
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
To find the head, sir?
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
No!
Captain!
We're being hailed.
Sir, we're being hailed.
Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.
What's this?
It's working.
Not very chatty.
He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.
Strength in numbers?
Serving with you has been an honor.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
And the Senate supports you?
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
It's not quite the face you remember.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
Looking up at the stars.
After you, Praetor.
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
With a full head of hair.
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
In time, Jean Luc.
Hello, Jean Luc.
Why am I here?
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
Long ago.
I don't know.
That's your life... not mine.
Please.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
Report!
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
So theyve got him up and running.
He's a very unusual android.
My God...
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Intruder alert!
Are we prepared?
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
The bond is broken.
Find her again.
How long?
What?!
Praetor...
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
They're holding position.
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
But surely...
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
I have a purpose.
Benny, God, take it easy...
What did I tell you?
Don't you think you should call a backup?
Gate three. It's boarding now.
Thank you.
What can I do for you folks?
We're only going to be here a few hours...
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
I understand.
What do you do?
I make maps.
Eh... yes.
Make any money?
What do you think of America?
Where did you stop last?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Where did you stop last?
Stay right there...
What was your last stop?
Elmo's...
Where's that?
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
It's real, George.
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.
Contain it and get back to me.
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
When can we expect containment?
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
It's taken on a disguise.
The extraterrestrial now looks like this.
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
We don't know what else to do. We need results.
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
Hello George.
Shermin...
What's all this for?
That's the chance we have to take.
Then you're going to have to do it without me.
What?
I just retired.
Mrs. Haydn...
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
I won't let anyone hurt you.
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
What?
Ah... no...
Steering wheel...
Steering wheel.
Steering wheel.
Gear shift.
Gear shift.
Dashboard.
What?!
Eh... police.
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
Good.
Which way?
What?
What?
What?
Pancakes.
What?
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
What?
Smile.
Smile... good?
What?!
Minneapolis.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
Minneapolis... good.
No gas.
Gas good?
Closed?
Who are you?
Gas.
No gas.
My... husband.
Shit.
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
Shit... shit... what shit?
In your pocket, please...
You. Mouth closed.
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
Money.
What?
I...
You want to try it?
I want to try it.
What's the matter?
Horses.
What?
Why are you going here? What is here?
When do you have to be here?
I do not understand.
Sun...
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
Eh... yes...
Do you have a baby?
No... The closest...
But I must go here.
The driver will...
You want this ticket?
Yes.
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Jennyhaydn.
Yes?
Goodbye.
What?
What is hell?
What are you doing?
Are you my friend?
Yes.
Nobody knows.
Why?
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
I do not want to.
I am not a good singer.
You liked my singing?
No. Get in.
Are you angry at me?
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
Where are you going?
I must meet my ship.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
I feel better if I move.
Asshole!!
Where did you learn that?
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
No one's traveling in this weather.
What are you saying?
You can stop. I will go on alone.
You are cold.
You're damn right I am.
What?
Good morning.
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
Oh, you're pretty...
They are beautiful.
The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
What for?
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
The cook again?
What will you say about us?
Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
How long will it take you to get home?
There.
Well...
What do I do now?
Tell the baby about me.
I will.
Help me!!
You could have killed us both!!
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
Call the police!!
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
You sure this is your car?
My grandmother's rich.
Slow down, slow down.
I told you I'm looking for someone.
In the cars, too?!
They after you?
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
Is it for real?
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
Tell him I'm not here.
You get that, Lyman?
They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
This has always been my favorite time of day.
Was there visual contact?
You married, Major?
Twenty-eight years.
To the same woman?
How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
It was a man though... right?
Where are you going?
I don't understand.
Is there a reward in this?
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
No problem.
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
I made my choice, Lenny.
Fuck you.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
You can't just... kill him.
I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
Forget it's there.
Cut it out, Tran.
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
Faith, call me, okay?
You talked to Iris?  When?
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
He has his uses too.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
We should talk alone.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
I understand.  No, I'm not.
What?  Right Here?
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
You alright?  Y'okay?
Yeah.  No, not really.
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
He records himself raping and killing her--
So've I.  Too much.
But this is a bad one.
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
He's been cooked-off
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
Okay... what about Strickland?
No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
Who was just here?
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
Nero.
Strickland.
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
Your sex life?
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
Yeah, but that was for love.
What's his name?
What the fuck are you doing?
Are we having a bad night?
Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
So am I.  Just trying to get by.
No, you're just trying to get off.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
Forget her.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
My God, Lenny.  What is it?
Black.  Jack.
And gives it to you.
Is this great fabric or what?
No more, Lenny.
But that doesn't add, does it.
No it doesn't.
That's where it gets a little strange.
And what about the guy that was following me?
What is it?
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Those two guys were cops.
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
Well, look at the plus side.
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
He's totally cut off from the outer world.
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
You see Tran?
Alright.  We're going up.
That's the original.  There are no copies.
Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?
Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
See you downtown.
Right.  That explains it.
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
Was this him?
Um... he was older.
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Anybody talk to the press?
No, sir.
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
Who knows.
Agent Mackelway.
What's the bad news?
You heard?
You have the body?
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
Yeah.
My God.
Not bad, huh?
You're a... you're sick.
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
I've been looking for you.
Yes.
How did you know he was a construction worker?
You have the photo from the diner?
He said it was a clue?
Maybe cause he's smart.
We have another one.
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
What are you doing?
Who?
Speck. Harold Speck.
From the grave?
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
He got away. I had him. He got away.
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
I don't believe this.
We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
Why did you go to Chicago?
I was visiting an old college friend.
I was looking for a pattern.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
I didn't use Low's name.
There was talk of a file photo.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
How long have you been downtown?
You work with Koessler?
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
That information's being withheld from the media.
Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
Yes I do.
Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
The man knew how to dress.
The other reason?
And one other thing.
What's that?
He thinks he looks young.
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
Because you asked him to, stupid.
There are Agency regulations about this.
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
It's a no-no.
I know.
I've been thinking about this.
He's called a couple times.
What did you tell him?
Not about coming to see Daitz?
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
The tattoo?
Sue Ann Hanson.
Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
That's true.
Then there's the other issue.
And nobody else can do that?
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
Jaime? Where are you?
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
Start killing people for real?
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
You were right. He found me.
Yeah, of course.
All the same killer?
Low calls him Suspect Zero.
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
I haven't changed anything.  Damn.
What happened?
Agent...
Unlock these cuffs.
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
How did you know Speck was a killer?
Agent Mackelway?
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
I don't carry it with me.
You? You went by the book?
Is he dead?
Was it Zero?
[Reality very risky.]
[Lionheart, what happened?]
Lead the way, Murman.
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
I want to help you.
[What does the file say?]
I want to go live with you.
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
What did you do to end up here?
I believe it's in my file, sir.
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
Koessler?
Speck is dead.
Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.
I don't think you understand.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
It's over for you.
You have to put things in perspective.
I know, I know.
You're right. I know.
Ever since I've known you.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
Are you calling Her?
You should call your Grandmother.
How are you ladies doing this evening?
What do you drive?
What kind of car do you drive?
You're a comedian?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
I'd say about two weeks.
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
Well, thank you...?
Nikki.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Mike.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Yes. Like the quiche.
I like quiche.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
Why? You're not a real man?
Just like that?
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
How was it hard?
Well, I left someone very special behind.
Tell me about it...
You too?
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
It does.
Like what?
Anything?
Charles! What's up, man?
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
...not until you book it...
They're out of Glenlivet.
Hi.
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
You haven't told then, huh?
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
Let me just check on my boy.
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
Oh my God.
The poor thing. Six years?
...And she's with someone else.
A couple of high rollers like you?
Could you believe it?
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
What do you guys do?
On the table.
You have to lay it on the table.
You want this in black chips.
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
Well, who represents you back east?
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
Why not?
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
Sorry, it's just that...
You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
Well... This is it.
Listen. I had a great time.
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
You're a comedian?
Yeah. And an actor.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
Well, I should be getting...
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
...The red piece of shit over there...
...well, it suits you...
Hello?
Hi, Mike?
Are you on the other line?
Yeah, hold on.
I can call back...
...Six months.
How are you doing?
Fine... I guess. You?
Good.  I think about things.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What kind of things?
You know, us.
Really?
I miss you, Mike.
Right.
Right.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
There's the rub.
I don't think I'm gonna take it.
It's a gig.
I mean, I need the money.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today?
Oh no?
I didn't mention her once today.
You want to hit the town tonight?
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
How many strokes?
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
I'll give you an eight. 
What'd you get?
Sounds more like Aids...
Kinda money, huh?
I'll get a Dewars rocks... 
Ah, there's the rub...
I just tested for one...
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
What's that guy's name? Sue?
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
I got to at least try once.
You haven't been drinking, have you?
You want to talk about it?
Uuuuugh!
Oh boy.
I'm such an asshole.
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
Well, that's dumb.
What's dumb about it?
You little bitch!
You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.
Make someone bleed.
What's he do?
How's it going for you two?
Not well.
Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
Good for you, man. He's being smart.
Don't call me ever again.
Are you ready to order?
Hello?
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
VEGAS.
What Vegas?
We're going to Vegas.
When?
Tonight, baby.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
I can't lose more than a hundred.
Wait.
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Vegas, baby!
Wake up, baby.
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
They're all skanks.
Cut that shit out.
She smiled baby.
That's not cool.
Did she, or did she not smile?
It doesn't matter...
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
That's where we make our scene.
You think they're watching?
Double down.
Yeah? Well obviously not always!
...Well, you know, not counting the first table.
Thanks for clarifying that.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Yea, how much?
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
Let's just leave.
Let's go.
Mikey's the big winner.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
That was so demeaning...
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
I know she's coming back.
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
We didn't do so bad after all.
Oh... a Dorothy.
No!
No! Not the camera guy!
What?
I gotta use the phone.
She didn't like me, anyway.
She thought you were money.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
Michelle went for you, right.
That was different.
He drives a carriage.
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
This version doesn't have fighting?
No.
You guys are such assholes.
What time's this party tonight?
Yeah. You met him once.
...the Copa, in New York...
How you guys doing?
It's on.
What are you doing?
You looked right at her, baby.
She didn't see.
Please, don't mess with me right now...
A day.
Tomorrow?
It's not like that...
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
Because he's a bitch.
...against the computer.
They're a finesse team...
What a surprise...
Oh, it's on, baby...
No.
Now?
No.
Yes she did.
That was pretty cold, dude.
It's on.
...honestly...
...you're money...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
...Tomorrow, then a day.
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
It's on.
It is on.
The bear's got his claws back.
Be smart about it.
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
And you?
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
Good.  He never doubted you.
No.  You ask for too much.
I ask for Justice.
The Court gave you justice.
An eye for an eye!
Be my friend.
Understood.  I just wish I was doing more to help out.
What's the matter, Carlo?
You're staying home.  You're not going out.
The food is on the table.
I'm not hungry yet.
Eat it, it's on the table.
Ba Fa Goulle.
You heard about your father?
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
Outside.
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
Is it necessary?
He's his own boss, and very competent.
When did he call?
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
Yes.
You mean Tattaglia.
Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
What was this for?
For bravery.
And this?
For killing a man.
What miracles you do for strangers.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
And now, what do you choose to do?
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
No, I wanted other things for you.
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
Yes.
You want him to stay in this country.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
I know.
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
You tell us about America.
How do you know I come from America?
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
Hey, beautiful girls!
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
I know about what you mean!
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
Mike!  The party starting!
Who are those girls?
That's for you to find out.
Mike!
What about Luca?  Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca.  That worries me.
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
That's easy to say; it's not your father.
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
Jesus, I don't know...
Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
What was that?
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
How will they come at you?
I know now.  I'll make them call me Don.
Michael, what are those men doing?
They're waiting to see my father.
Who is he?
You really want to know?
You like spaghetti?
Then the legs at the knees...
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
Then Luca turned to the other man...
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
I told you you wouldn't like him.
How do you do.
Michael?
Hello.  Kay?
How is your father?
He'll be OK.
I LOVE YOU.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Can you say it?
Huh?
I can't...
Please say it.
I don't think so either.  I better go.
Don't you want dinner first?
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
Your sister wants to ask you something.
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
Don't ask me.
Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
Until the old man tells me different.
All right, Sonny.  All right.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Where are you going?
To the city.
Mikey, you look beautiful!
We're going to New Jersey?
I do renounce him.
And all his works?
Let us fill up our Regimes.
He talked to you?
Yeah.
How do you do.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
We?
Is that good?
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
Uncanny!
Hi Tom.
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
I'll come down.
Okay, darling.
You'd say if you mind?
No, I like him.
Shut up.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
I hope it wasn't cheap.
Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose --
It's just an undercoat. 
Say again?
You know, a primer.
I'm intruding.
Can you mix a martini?
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
I met him in New York.
I'm never going back!
You like jazz!
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
Could we sail to Venice?
Sure. I love Venice.
You're breaking my ribs!
What?
I played piano in a few places.
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
Do you have any brothers?
I didn't mean with you in it.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
Is Freddie here?
I'm prepared to take the blame.
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
That's good.
I've got plans!
Ripley's plans.
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
What?
I wanted to tell you my plan.
How?
You love me and you're not marrying me.
What are you doing?
Marge-maintenance.
Hello?
Dickie?
Who is it?
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
Tom. How are you? You look well.
I'm well, thank you.
Far cry from New York.
Yes it is.
No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.
I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
I never said that!
Frances?
Are you okay?
Hello Marge.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
How long's he staying for?
He hates being confronted.
Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
Did he kill Freddie?
Marge, when did you get here?
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
Dickie did it.
Hello Marge!
Look at me what?
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
I found Dickie's rings.
What?
You've got Dickie's rings.
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
I don't believe you.
No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley.
So you found Peter...
Is this you?
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
What's your secret?
I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith Randall.
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
Which is?
Randall.
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
How did you know that?
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Let's go.
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Dickie, my God!
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
What?
Just kidding. Are you alone?
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
So -- are you travelling under R?
Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
A ragione. A ragione. 
Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
Will we see you later?
I can't later.
Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
Ten thirty?
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one.
What did he say?
He's already angry, I don't think --
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
Are you okay?
It's okay.
Tom, are you okay?
You try. You try talking to her.
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
Hello. What are you up to?
All kinds of things. Making plans.
Was that Meredith?
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
Or Tom and Peter even.
Well that would be even better gossip.
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
Dickie Greenleaf?
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
Can we go up? Do you mind?
Of course. What happened to your face?
I really don't want to see anybody.
Even your fiance...?
Even her.
What about Thomas Ripley?
November, I thought.
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
November 7th is my information.
I don't remember the exact date.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
A few days ago.
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
It is a little coarse, yes.
I have!
You got a .44 Magnum?
That's an expensive gun.
You like ball games?
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
You want to canvass?
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
Well, we're all working tonight.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
Yes?
My name is Travis.
I can believe that.
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
You must be rich.
It keeps ya busy.
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
Oh. Who was that again?
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
What are you doing?
I bought a couple of tickets.
Damn.
Where are you going?
I'm leaving.
These are not the kind of movies I go to.
This is sort of high class...
I mean porno movies.
Well... mostly...
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
What about the record?
Hello, Travis.
I see where Palantine got the nomination.
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
Travis?
You forgot "sexy".
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
Just what?
Have you been noticing anything strange?
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
How long has he been there?
Try holding the match like this.
This is gotta be a game, right?
This I gotta see.
Ouch!
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
Is he Italian?
No, why?
You sure he's not Italian?
With the other hand, right?
Betsy, come over here a moment.
What is it? I'm busy.
What is your name? My name is Travis.
Awh, come off it, Pal.
That's fine.
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
Yeah.
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
For a fee.
I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
Where.
You carry a piece? You need one?
Hello.
You looking for some action?
Why you hang around with them greasers?
A girl needs protection.
What's your name?
That ain't much of a name.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
What's your real name?
I don't like my real name.
Iris.
That's a nice name.
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
I musta been stoned.
Do they drug you?
You can do it in my mouth.
I can leave anytime I want.
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
Well, you want to or not?
Where?
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
I... I don't get along with people like that.
You a narc?
God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
You just gonna leave 'em?
What should I do? Call the cops?
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
Sure you don't want to come with me?
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
Nice talking to you, Travis.
No trouble with the Hack Bureau?
No Sir.
Got your license?
I can't sleep nights.
You want to work uptown nights?
How's your driving record?
Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
Physical? Criminal?
Age?
Some. Here and there.
Military record?
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
You moonlightin?
No, I want long shifts.
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Well then check back tomorrow.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
Your name Sport?
Anything you say, officer.
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
Shit.
I'm no cop.
Hey, Sport. How are things?
What's going on?
I'm here to see Iris.
Travis.
What's the action around?
Wiz?
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Well, I just, you know...
Things got ya down?
Real down.
The taxi life, you mean.
Yeah.
I know.
Hey!  Now there's some good news.
Spit it out.
It's me sir.
He says he's leaving the island sir.
Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
I'm a field agent.
Well yes I suppose ...
You suppose?
Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder...
Limp dick?
Wrong.
What, vou?
What are you doing?
Mason.  Mason?
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
Womack ripped it up, right?
Hi.
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
What about you, Delly?
You'll stand by me?
Dad?
Well...
Do you... remember me?
Me too.
You look... different.
You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.
How'd they get it inside?
So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
We were in love... weren't we?
Nothing.  
Do you have the...
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
Well, there's got to be a way...
When did you start smoking?
Exactly.  And he got good.
Now, did you remember that, or...
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
I... I need a drink of water.
Only one in town.  Get in, son.
Here we are.
Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
Are you saying that he's...
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
No.  But...
What's that?
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
Harry, son.  Harry.
Nine and-a-half years ago.
That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her soul.
They couldn't wait to see you.
This is the staff of the Bijou.
Oh.  What... what time is it?
"February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
Ernie.
I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up.
You bet.
Well...
Beautiful, wasn't it?
Dad, I...
Ha!
Luke... what time is it?
Jesus...
The film broke...
I'm here.
Did you... did you...
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
Anybody take it?
A few.
Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
The G-man?
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
Here, one of mine.
What is it?
... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me.
That's where you live.
Evening, Luke.
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
You kids off to the dance?
You think he's drunk somewhere?
What's his rent?
Huh?
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
I was decorated.
I know.  A Purple Heart.
You can't testify.
The FBI can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong.
Cigarette?
When'd you quit smoking?
Not any more.
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
When was that?
I taught you that.
Sit.  Play with me.
Is there a young Tim?
That's my r-r-rent.
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
Please, sit.
The customers?  I don't know...
Oh.
It's about me.
What happened?
What exactly did you hear?
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
I suppose.  Thanks.
Yes.  Very.
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
I already have.
My girlfriend.  If she still is...
No.  Absolutely not.
Miss Hayworth?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
No. Just a few hours.
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
I was wondering...
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
Would you like some brandy?
I think so.
How do you like our little hamlet?
Where are you from originally, Annie?
San Francisco.
Because she was afraid.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
Do you think I should go?
That's up to you.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Yes.
Is anyone there?
Yes, I did.
Mother!
No!
Mom, they're in a cage!
They haven't harmed anyone.
Miss Daniels?
Is smoking fun?
Oh, I suppose so.
Could I have a puff?
I know.
Don't you like us?
Darling, of course I do!
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.
I don't know, honey.
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
Mitch, let's turn back.
The little Brenner girl.
Lois!
It's Alice, ain't it?
No, it's Lois!
Good morning.
I wonder if you could help me.
Do you know him?
Yep.
Where does he live?
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Yes, but where?
Right across the bay there.
See where I'm pointing?
Yes?
That's where the Brenners live.
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
The two kids?
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
Thank you.
Yep?
The little girl's name.
The little Brenner girl?
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
How much for the phone calls?
I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
What happened?
Young woman cut herself.
You cut yourself outside, Miss?
Gulls!
No. Here's fine. 
A what?
You did say birds?
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
Whose side are you on?
Yes, very.
How long have you known her?
I told you. We met yesterday.
In a bird shop.
Yes.
No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
Mother?
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
Well... well, is everyone all right?
I got them all, Mother.
When do you think they'll come?
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
That's a chance we have to take.
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
Mother, get a rope!
Oh, my God, look at her!
I can handle it.
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
You're doing fine.
They're gone. The same pattern.
But they'll be back.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
They won't be.
We'll worry about that when we get there.
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
What?
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
Would you like me to go for her?
I don't mind, really.
Shhhh. Shhhh.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
He was killed last night. By birds.
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
Yes.
He's not home.
Well, where did he go?
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
Lovebirds.
Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
Aren't these lovebirds?
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Are they moulting now?
How can you tell?
What did you say?
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
I don't know you.
How?
We met in court.
We never met in court or anyplace else.
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
I think you're a louse.
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
Do you practice here?
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
What kind of law?
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
Why... 
Yes?
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
Yes.
How do you know Annie?
We... we went to school together. College.
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
What did it say?
Yes, but...
You are, aren't you?
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
I'm sure.
Seven o'clock then.
Why did he shoot her?
What?
Oh, yes.
Will I be seeing you again?
How does Mother know what I like to do?
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.
No.
You were lying.
I wrote the letter.
But you tore it up.
Yes.
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
I told you what happened in Rome!
Do you expect me to believe...?
It is for me.
But not for me.
Cheers.
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
Helping travelers.
And Fridays? What do you do then?
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
What'll it say?
You'll think me very bold, sir.
Are you all right?
Last night? What do you mean?
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
Do you want some mustard with this?
Some cream?
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
Are you staying?
Really? Tell me about it.
It's an uprising.
Of birds?
What it was, probably...
It's so damn quiet out there.
It was like that yesterday.
What do you mean?
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
Melanie, Melanie...
I'm frightened, Mitch.
Melanie...
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
I think it's safe to get out now.
Don't let's take any chances.
The bay doesn't.
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
Do you want to try your father again? 
Where are they heading?
Inland.
Santa Rosa?
When will they stop?
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
What time is it?
Almost two a.m.
The power.
Mitch...
We'd better light some of those lamps.
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
Hello, Miss Daniels.
There we are!
That... that... who was that?
Have you got a pencil?
Yes, certainly. 
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
What were the crows after at the school?
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
For what purpose?
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
Help how? What do you want to do?
We need them.
Not if they're starting a war.
Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?  Are you coming?
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
I fear he may have to.
You asked to see me, ma'am?
I want you to help my little girl.
Ask this one favor --
You have his promise, then?
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
You must leave this house.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
He's not home.
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
Dr. MacFarlane --
I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
Well --
Gray killed her.
I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it.
She's unconscious.
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
No.
What?
Where shall we put it? In the back?
This is not a woman!
It was a woman when we put her in.
Are you a doctor, too?
Aye, but I still wonder how much.
I thought this was a school day.
You'll not need that again, Georgina.
He'll not leave the grave -- not since Wednesday last when we buried the lad.
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
I am the best man for the job.
It might be an interesting case.
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
But what makes a thought start?
What are you going here? Have I not told you --
I've ordered nothing from you.
This is a gift.
I take no gifts from you.
This is a gift you'll not return.
Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
I've drunk enough tonight.
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
I presume you shall.  This won't be my last visit here.
What did you hear?
Can anyone hear what we say?
I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
"The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair.  The villain Burke, the meager Hare --"
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
Nearly a year.
Any attacks of pain since?
Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?
How long ago?
And why not?  He's a good lad -- bright and able.
Crony indeed!
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
You're not going to Gray.
You've been with Gray again.
Where are they? Last chance.
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
Tell her... we'll get him.
Check and mate.
Two down. Two to go.
You think I'm crazy.
What do they do that they had to kill her?
I was hoping you'd find out.
I think we should get some support?
That was a fucking hollow point!
Think maybe knives do?
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
Sssshhh. She's resting.
You lied at my trial.
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
Wrong. Answer.
What did they give you?
What Scar? What fucking scar?
You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!
Fucking Zombie.
I heard you were looking for this.
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
You're him. Corvis.
I was a friend of your sister's.
He didn't kill her.
Daisy. How did you know?
This tree. Here's where it happened.
... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
So you're going to kill him?
It's ok, it's ok...
It's not. I can't take it.
... it connects you to me...
Yeah, we do.
I know.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
They botched the execution.
How about sign of a big black bird?
Just don't believe everything you see.
Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
You mean Alex.
I do. Every day.
What's with your friend there?
But you, you've had them.
You want me to walk a straight line?
I want you... to bend over.
Look, can I just call a cab?
Why are there so many?
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
Erin!
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
It still doesn't mean...
I think I dropped an earring.
You're in with them.
It's not what you think.
You killed her!
Stay away from me! Stay away!
I don't believe you.
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
I leave that in your hands.
What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
Such power exists?
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Hi Mom!
Did you have a nice day, dear?
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
He gave these to you?
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
I thought that was only for bombs.
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
You think they'll ever find him?
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
You're just kidding, aren't you?
What does that mean?
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
Did all these people die in wars?
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
Go to the movies.
All right.
Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
I don't believe it.
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
About five months -- your months.
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
I can judge only by what I see.
I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
It was a wonderful day.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
Hello--
I will be in just a minute.
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
Is it real?
I wonder if we ought to--
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
Is that what you're thinking about?
I don't know how to thank you.
Everyone seems so-- 
Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
May I see you for a minute?
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
I want to know what he told you last night.
What happened?
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
It must be twelve-thirty.
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
Where is the meeting going to be?
"Klaatu barada nikto."
I -- I thought you were--
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
You sure about that?
Would you like to sell it?
The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
But I suppose you know the answer.
No -- I'm afraid not.
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
I don't like horror comics.
How do you like Santa Carla?
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
Can't stand light?
Yeah.
Why not?
They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
We don't ride with vampires.
They're gaining on us!
Well... we blew Plan A.
Time to activate Plan B.
All together?
Okay.  Where's Nosferatu?
The Prince of Darkness.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
They're looking at us.
Did you see that sucker burn?!
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
Two down and two to go.
<u>Four</u> to go.
Death to all vampires!
Maximum body-count.
We are awesome monster-bashers!
The meanest!
We still going?
Honda 250, huh?
That's right.
We were gonna grab some food.
Don't!  Stop!
I'm my own man.
What's going' on?
Where is she?!
Hey, take it easy.
What is this, David?
Where you going?
With him?
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
You can't kill me, Star.
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
He's not glowing.
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
What's that smell!?
Oh, no...
What?
What happens in tow and a half hours?
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
Smells good.  When do we eat?
I told Max eight o'clock.
'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
... And stay outta here.
Thanks, Grandpa...
Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
Good!
Are we havin' fun or what?
Did we have a date tonight?
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
Hi... I'm Laddie.
It was a dream, Star.
You didn't tell David?
I like Michael.
Still mad at me?
For what.
He looks dead.
He's just a deep sleeper.
I'll hitch.
Michael, are you still in bed?
Okay?
I'm tired now.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
Michael!...
We're getting close...
What's that smell?
Ocean air!
Tell them to get something to eat.
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Lights out, Sam.
What's wrong?  Tell me.
Where's Michael?
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan.  The Frog Brothers.
Nanook, stop breathin' on me.
Oh, no.  Now what?
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
Ohmygod...
-- a job.
Say hello to Thorn.
Not impressed, are you?
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
This looks terrific, Lucy.
Max!  What's wrong?
Does it burn?
Are you following me?
Well... yeah.  Sure.
Okay.  Talk.
Star.
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
Me, too.
I'm Michael.
Let's go see them.
I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.
When?
Why not?
Because I love you...
I know, I've felt it...
David's looking for me... I have to go.
You've got to put this on.
Take laddie.
Huh?
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
It's gone.  I feel it!
What!?  He <u>can</u> and I <u>can't</u>?!  No fair!!
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
This room is mine.
I was here first.
Where are we going?
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
What would that make Mom?
Did you spill something?
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
Mom's home?...
I'm making you a sandwich.
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
Who are you calling?
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
What do you want from us?
Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.
Maybe dinner.
Dogs don't eat each other.
Where these tracks headed?
That night?
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
Watch Clark.
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
What?
Somebody broke in.
We got to burn 'em.
Let's open it.
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
You catch anything he was saying?
I said where?  Where'd you go?!
Was dark... find a light...
Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!
It's shorted out or something!
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
Torch it over there!
MacReady!
Look, I'm just guessing...
Where's the other half?
What we going to do?!
Torch them!!
What do we do about those three?
MacReady!
What?
Garry's missing!
Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!
What clothes?
Then I'll have to kill you.
We should have jumped his ass.
I think so.
Maybe we shouldn't.
Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
My God, what in hell happened here?
Anything?
Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.
Well, who's got access to it?
Now hold him.
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
And if anyone tries to wake me...
I guess you're okay.
Nothing we can do about that.
In this weather?
Goes on like that quite awhile.  What do you gentlemen make of it?
A couple of hours.
I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away.
When was the last time you used it?
I'm getting worried about you.  You ought to have a checkup.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
After all this mess then.
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
How far's that?
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
Right.  Why not?
Hey, man...!
Put that down!
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
We're on fire!
Don't let up, Childs!
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
Looks good.
How long's it been?
What's...
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
How's that Thing get to the dogs?  I though we stopped it in time.
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
Somebody definitely messed with it.
What kind of test?
Tie up Clark, too.
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
What is it?
Where was he trying to go?
What about Childs?
Get back!!
The generator!
Maybe it ain't coming.
Then we go after him.
Get your gear on.
So what do you make of it?
You know damn well what we both make of it.
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
We should sleep in shifts.
What's happened?!
MacReady, that you?
It's the generator I think!  No power.
MacReady...?
He's one of them.
You hear that?
It must have been hard, leaving your work.
Now how did you get hurt?
I had an accident.
What do you do on the towers?
On the towers?
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
And everyone looks like us?
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
... Well, you wanted to see it.
This is it?
Yes.  Just about here.
Sir... have you a name?
Morlocks --
You know of them?
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
I was lucky.  The others weren't.
Because you'll never die.
When was his mother taken?
Last night.
Send him away.
My God... I saw this.
It frightens you.
Yes...
So, do we go on?
Yes.
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
It's what they want you to see.
This is the way in?
Machines?
Yes.
Vox?
What's it all for?
The air... the power.
Why did they built it?
This has to end.
End...?
What's your name?
No, we created the Morlocks.
And what of the Eloi?
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
Now will you go?
That was a foolish thing to do.
I'm tired of running.
I don't think that's going to happen.
And why not?
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
May I help you?
Got here as soon as I could.
Dance with me...
You promised me flowers.
Sorry... I was distracted.
Well there's something new.
I need to... um... talk to you.
Talk away, Professor.
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
All right, what is it now?
Admiration?  My my.
I mean... well... affection.
You know, the moment is rather dying here.
A moonstone.
Got here as soon as I could.
Dance with me...
You know I can't.
Alex, what is it?
I need... to talk to you.
All right...
No... let's walk through the city.
Alex, what is it?
My God...
You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
Heavens, look at that now!
Alex... people are staring.
Let them.
Do you know you were humming?
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
Tonight's the night?
What?
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
Oh?
I'm sorry, David.
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
What is it?
You wouldn't believe me.
Why don't you come to our house instead?
You won't say that in a week.
Did you hear me, lad?
Yes.
Is there a lot of illness?
His curiosity is amazing.
Your husband is dead?
You're not from beyond the valley.
Why not?
You seem fascinated by the stars.
You can see so many here.
Good night, then.
Yes!
We all have that dream.
All of you?
Every night.
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
This is magnificent...
Thank you.
And this is your "work"?
The mud carriers.
I can see Kalen's point.
What's it all for?
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
It must have been safe.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
Alexander...?
You lost someone.
Yes.
Is it?
So you can use it now?
Yes... I suppose so.
Go back to your own time?
Kalen...
Mara...?
Mara -- what -- ?!
Do you have it?!
Oh, I'm already swooning.
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
Here?
Yes, sir, he --
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
May I get you some --
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
Might I ask why?
What are your people called?
He said he traveled for two months.
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
My father has gone to a better place.
Where do they take them?!
We have to go after them, find where -- !
What do you mean?!
They've gone to a better place.
You know that's not true.
Then it's time to change that --
My fowl have polluted the yard.
How did you get hurt?
What did you do at night?
We'll see about that.
Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
No, you're safe --
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
You ok?
Then don't.
But... what about Starks?
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
We never should have done this to him...
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
He's recovering on the third floor.
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
In where?
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
And what's that?
My business?
Becker, how do you sleep at night?
You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
Do I know you from somewhere?
Did you know my father?
My father used to talk about you.
I thought you said you never knew your father.
What should they be looking for?
Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
Sure.
This is really happening, isn't it?
I need to get this letter to someone.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
Mom, he just fixed our car.
Why?
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
You two ok?
Your mom take anything before this happened?
Yeah, but I don't know what.
[Beat] What's your name?
But I like it I guess.
I think I can remember what's on them.
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
I looked it up.
It's December 25th, 1993 today.
But no one knew until after...
[Beat] You bled to death.
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
I don't believe a thing she just said.
I have no idea.
How long do we have?
They're not here.
They're not.
What? What are you thinking?
They've got lives to be grateful for.
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
You gotta stop thinking like that.
Then, where are you going?
I've been ok.
Good. How's your mom?
How you doin'?
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
And if I didn't want to come?
I guess I'd ask you why.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
Why, what would you do?
I could try to...make it stop.
No. I don't want it to.
My God you look exactly like him.
I never knew my father. Did you?
How'd he get it?
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
What do you mean?
It doesn't look all that different.
Why don't you help me?
And how do you know that?
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
How...how do you know?
I did?
I'm not gonna let that happen.
You still don't believe me, do you?
I tried to kill my wife.
What were you talking about the other day?
I know you need one when it's really cold.
[Beat] How do you know?
It's gonna be sticky.
You ever been to jail?
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
Can you drive?
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
I'm not sure.
You don't have anywhere to stay?
Well, where are you from?
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
Of course you don't know.
Well, how'd you get here?
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
You want a drink?
Yup. That's me.
[Beat] I do it.
Well, good for you.
[Beat] Why?
This is a great song.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
Hon.
Uh-huh.
Hon?
'Bye, honey.  I won't wait up.
Darryl.
What?
Why?
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
In the leg.
Who's the nut?
Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law?
You girls are in some hot water.
We're both fine.
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
I have no problem with that.
Armed robber.
A .38.
Good God.
Oh shit.
What's wrong?
Stop.
What for?
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
Louise, is that you?
Well, I guess I'd better...
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
That sounds nice.
Oh.  I... where's Louise?
What did ya do?
I'm a robber.
You're a bank robber?
Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in the world are you doin' here?
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
I always knew that.
Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
You're in Oklahoma?!
Tell me now.
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
Peaches.
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Hello...
Who is it?
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?
Is this your car?
In the back?
Front.
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
What time are you gonna pick me up?
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
Okay.  I will, too.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
How come he let you go?
'Cause I didn't ask him.
How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
Oh my God.
Get the car.
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
Shit!  I... I, which way?
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
Just what is that supposed to mean?
It means shut up, Thelma.
I'm cash poor.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
What do you mean?
Give me the keys.
Did you finish thinking?
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
Will I be?
He's got a lot to be proud of.
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
That's puttin' it mildly.
I didn't ask him to come!  It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase.
What happened to your hair?
What's wrong with you?
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.
Drive!  Drive away!
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
Holy shit.
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
You think you've found your calling?
You're disturbed.
Try to.
Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that?
Thelma.
I want you to call Darryl.
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
It won't work.
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.
Louise?  Where are we?
Just past Boise City.
Now what?
Now what what?
You mean now or before?
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
This is so beautiful.
Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.
What?
Nothing.  It's not funny.
What?!
Harlan.
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
Thelma!
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
What?
Sorry!
Ready?
Yeah, you want it?
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
Louise?
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
Me too.  I feel awake.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
We can change our names.
Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look! See if that's him!
What?
We've gone insane.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
Shit!
What?!
What?!  What d'you think?!
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
You're a good friend.
You too, sweetie, the best.
Louise!
What in the hell is it?!
Isn't it beautiful?!!
God!  It looks like the Army!
We're not giving up, Thelma.
Then let's not get caught.
What are you talkin' about?
Go.
You're a good friend.
We been seein' you all along the way.
What?  What are you talkin' about?
I'm not apologizing for shit!
Say you're sorry.
Hi!
Hi there!  You alright?
We're fine!  How are you?
Where you goin'?
I'll try to be more careful.
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
Well, uh, can you tell us his name?
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
No harm, no foul?
You sent that?
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
Gay? He said you were gay?
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
Nah.
Never?
Whatever happened to Mary?
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
I mean since then.
I don't know.
Yeah, right.
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
Hey, look on the bright side --
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Wait a second, I never told you that.
Mary's a babe!
Huh? But why did Healy?
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
Well then you've got to call her, man.
How the hell did you get here anyway?
Well? What are you waiting for?
Got cash.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Check.
You know, clean the pipes.
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
Uh-huh. Where was he?
Bob, do you remember Mary?
Who?
A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
Healy you dog!
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
Stalker, huh?
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Take it easy, that's Bill.
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
Hello...? Sully...?  Sully, that you?
Who the fuck is it to you?
Oh yeah.
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
You own a home there?
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
Same here again.
By the way, what's your name?
Don't you want to know my name?
I already know it, Mary.
How'd you know that?
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
Some buildings I'm working on.
What's that?
I work with retards.
-- He's in a cage?!
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now?
Fine. Fine.
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
And it doesn't cramp your style?
I guess.
Mary ah, forget it.
No, forget it, it was stupid.
Fuck!!
Urrggghh...
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
All you want is a phone number?
Well, I know you're busy...
I don't buy it.
No.
She's blackmailing you, right?
You want her dead, don't you?
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
I think your life's about to change.
Nope. Never been.
Huh?
Four kids, three different guys.
What are you doing?
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
Hey, hey, hey!
You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?
What do you mean 'why'?
Do what?
Turn her over to a stalker.
Oh Christ... poor dog.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
Mainly I work out of Boston.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Harvard?
Did you study under Kim Greene?
Among others.
Kim and I are close friends!
Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
You know, I really should take your card.
I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
Friend. Baseball bat.
That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
How many is that?
Ho-ly shit.
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
Oh. Well I am.
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
What's that supposed to mean?
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
So who's the lucky guy?
Good lookin'?
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
I'm buying bananas tonight.
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
Holy shit...
Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
Pat's an architect, too.
Oh yeah. Fine.
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
No, it's an old football injury.
Huh?
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
Hi, Ted.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Are you all right?
Ted, are you okay?
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
By the way, how's he doing?
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Hey.
Hi, Ted.
You look great.
What's that?
Sure.
What are you?
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
So you're a writer?
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
That you put a murderer on my trail?
Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.
Please leave.
Mary, come on...
What what are you doing here?
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
Get over here.
Really?
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you doing?!
I, uh... I got it stuck.
You got what stuck?
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
Is it the frank or the beans?
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
What do you mean?
No, no, please!
Ho there.
Hey.
So what's up?
Okay.  So is that a yes or a no?
Franks and beans!
How are you doing, Warren?
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
See you, Warren.
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
Tomorrow...
Good.
He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.
Well, I'm not.
Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.
Where've you been? We've been trying to find you all morning.
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.
Slow down. Smell that?
Yeah?
What's it about?
What did you think of Lippman's column this morning?
Then they should speak up.
The sun came up today.
That is correct.
And the second condition?
John. How much time?
Still heading for Cuba.
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
How's my favorite President?
Busy. But you've got his heart.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
Secretary of Defense...
Hey, sport. You winning?
Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.
I was eating that.
Still think Cuba isn't important?
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
I don't care. Cancel it.
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support.
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
Bob. Bet you had a late night.
Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
Just a second, Mr. President.
Hey.
Hey. Nice tie.
Yeah.
I thought we were staying on the reservation.
FBI? What you investigatin'?
A murder. On the reservation.
What are you doing?
What's this about?
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
It ain't Geronimo.
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
What journey?
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
South Dakota...  Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?
I did.
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
No. That's Ray here. Ray...
Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
How'd you know?
I got one up on ya.
Meet me at base. Over.
Let's see it.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
I'll sleep around a little.
Thanks, Cooch.
Tread matches. It's the car.
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
Why?
You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
Come on, Ray. Come forward.
Ray...
I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
What are you --
What?!
Bullshit.
-- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
What did he say?
What was he saying?
Why should I tell you.
And...
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
Red Deer Table, Ray.
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
Cuz I'm a skin?
Cuz you're a cop.
Not no more.
Still after Jimmy?
Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
Crow Horse, listen --
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
Well, it was just a dream, I --
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
What do you mean?
Sorry.
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones.
What's that?
1868...
Ray. Ray, don't let go now, Man. Ray...
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
X22. Read.
I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
Come back?
Ray. X22.
X21. Come back.
What are you doing on the reservation?
Ray...
Mister Tully.
Do you want a coffee?
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
No way. No fuckin' way.
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
Well, it is. It is that, too.
That's a big comfort to me.
I could be, too.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
I thought he'd never leave.
Everybody's got to be somewhere.
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
It would have been really embarrassing!
Why not?
I saw one.
Where did you see that?
Yes, ma'am.
Where were you?
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
Two.
Two miles.
The what?
It never came up.
No.
What would you say, too fast...too quick...
And far too aggressive.
I'm special.
Yes. I'll give you that!
Lieutenant...
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
Harmless!
How about anything, anything you want to do.
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
What about the plane?
Used to what?
I'm different.
Let's make it at eight.
Make what?
Why'd you do that?
It dies. We live.
You're an animal.
No!
You ever think about killing another human being?
It's just as I thought.
You're totally insane.
Come on.
Where?
And now?
And now I want you.
You always get what you want?
I want it understood.
Food...and you...my F-14!
In that order?
Well no...inverse order.
You ever fly an F-14? 
Danger?
. Yeah!
Doesn't it ever bother you?
Just good luck.
Where'd you get it.
...they say you're alright.
I'm fine.
This is it, then.
That's not what I hear.
I was flying...my responsibility.
Do what, show you a good time?
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
No.
What do you want?
I want it back.
What?
You don't believe that.
What do you do when you come here?
I sit. I think. I play games.
What kind of games?
Want to play the game?
Goose is dead.
True.
Now?
Take something off.
Off me or off you?
That's three.
Looks like a tie.
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
Well?
Yes sir. I do, Sir.
One SIXTH the speed of sound!
Yes sir.
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
F-14's sir.
Tomcats?
Lieutenant... Is there... a Russian attack?
Yes, Sergeant?
Remember one thing.
Can't shake him.
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
MAVERICK.
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.
Let's hope you're right!
What is he doing?
That's missile lock!
He better be kidding!
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
This is crazy!
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
What?  What is it?
Were upside down!
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
I'm pulling up.
We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down.
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
What are you doing?
Saving them some paperwork.
Okay, okay.
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
Yawing right.
I know!
Rudder's left, stick's forward.
I've got it -- hold on!
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
What are you talking about, we gotta go!
Gotta go, man.
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
You go. I'm staying with it.
Is there something I should know?
Just relax.
Is it the plane?
The plane is fine.
You're not supposed to...
But I have to!
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
Well what?
What do you want?
What do I want?
What do you want?
Well, I don't know. That depends.
Like what?
Did what?
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
The list is long, but distinguished.
So's my Johnson.
So I've heard.
Who's your pilot?
Tom Kazansky.
No shit. The Iceman....
You think you can stay up with us.
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
How was it?
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
We did it!
Come on, we're next.
Something bothering you?
STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
What what are you doing? We're cover!
I'm pinned to the panel.
1000.
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
I was a victim of circumstance.
What'd you do?
Hear about Ice?
What now?
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH.
ON THE NOSE?
I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD TONE ON IT.
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
I guess I owe you one.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
You saved our lives. You did it!
Figured it out yet?
Who is the best.
Nope.
I think I can work it out on my own.
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
Just below ten thousand.
I don't know what to tell you, Skip.
I've seen this before.
So have I.
Who's the hell is that?
I...FORGOT SOMETHING.
What the hell you doing?
You won?!!!
It was bad.
Morning, Coogan.
Was going.  Now you are.
Yes sir..
Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
Yes sir.
Then why are you here?
For the same reason you are.
How do you feel?
All right.
Goose is dead.
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
I called your house.
Or....
Or you can quit.
I'm nothing like him.
You may not think so, but you are.
I never heard that.
What's wrong with this one?
Where's yours?
Over there man.
Welcome to Mars.
What to the rebels want?
So, where to?
The Last Resort.
First time on Mars?
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
Lemme ask you a question.  Ever fuck a mutant?
Need a ride?
And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
But maybe you can change all that.
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.
Thank you.
Get it, please.
I'll go encode your room key.
Well, my boy, you're a hero.
Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet.
What the fuck is going on down there?!
If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
Stop fighting and get out.
Kill him.
What is it?
I'm with an very important client.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Why not?
Good evening...  Doug.  I'm Dr. Lull.
So, been married long?
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
Your sexual orientation?
Blonde, brunette, redhead?
Brunette.
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
Sleazy...and demure.
Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.
Amazing.  Where are we?
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
Suppose I do...then what?
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
Any news of Quaid?
Quaid!  That's Quaid!
Where?
HER!
Pull them out.
Sit down.
Where's Kuato?
What, aliens?
You tell me.
Shit!
They found us!  Everybody out!
They sell fake memories.
Oh, Rekall.
I don't know.  Maybe.
Hey, Quaid!
What trip?
You went to Rekall, remember?
Let me buy you a drink.
Harry, what the hell is this?
Come on, let's go have that drink.
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Where?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
Where is he?
Shit!
I've got a weak signal over there.
He's not at ground level.
I've got a lock!  There!
Look at this shit.
I'm sorry.  Would you please rephrase the question.
How did I get in this taxi?!
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
Would you please repeat the destination?
The fare is eighteen credits, please.
Quit while you're ahead.
Is that better?
The brunette.  The one you told me about.
Who is she?
Nobody?!  What's her name?
I don't know.
It's not funny, Doug.  You dream about her every night.
...You mean it?
Lori...
Yeah, sweetheart?
Let's do it.
Do what?
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
And you believe him?
Lori, move.
Well...What do you say?
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
You went to those brain butchers?!
Not talk!  I said TALK!!
I'm not your wife.
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
It was implanted by the Agency.
And falling in love?
I didn't know you were so kinky.
I suppose you're not here either.
Nice to meet you.
Mars.
Right.  Mars.
I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.
How real does it seem?
As real as any memory in your head.
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
What's he talking about?
Blondes.
I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!
I don't remember you.
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
Hauser left me a note.
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
I think you better leave.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
I thought you didn't like me.
So you dropped by to apologize?
Now what?
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
Not bad, for a hooker.
I don't need Kuato for that.
He's lying.
Where are you going?!
The reactor.
What reactor?!
Where's this "reactor" come from?
Aliens built it.
You sure about this?
This is the suitcase you gave me.
Wait!
What?
You guys all set?
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
Yeah, like they got a plan...
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
Yeah, still got one poking around.
How much you think?
What the hell is that, anyway?
Cannon fuse.
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
Knock it off, Burt!
That's fine.  We've got some new things to teach them.
She's got my vote.
Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French.
Oh my God.
He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!
We're not going over there, right?
So...now what?
Howdy, Rhonda.
You're really leaving, huh?
You didn't cook breakfast?
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.
You're gonna get us hung up.
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
We did it!  We faced temptation and we did not bend!
So long, cactus!
Jeez, look at that guy.
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Reckon he hated Perfection more than us?  You suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
Jesus!  I don't <u>believe</u> this!
You're hung up again.
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
Fifteen lousy bucks.
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
What the hell are they?
We'll take your word for it.
Prairie dog burrow...
God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
Well, folks, what's the plan?
Don't he have a home to go to?
You're right, don't matter where they come from.
I'm gonna kick his ass!
Its tires are flat...
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
<u>I'm</u> making the run to the Cat.
Like hell you are.
Watch your ass, shithead.
Damn it.  What the hell are they doing?  They're up to something.
Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
They're...they're trying to make us move!
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
What the hell are you doing?!!
Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!
Yeah...but no ties.
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
Well, I brung her something I know she likes.
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
Burt!  Heather!
We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
Well, what's wrong with it?
You sure this is where it was?
Come on.  Get away from it!
Twenty.
Darn it!
Think it's still following us?
Ready?
What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
It worked!  There they go!
I brought it... to the coroner.
You're fishing. You don't know shit.
...we had to lick his boots clean.
...Where're we goin'?
That-a-boy. Hospital.
Or this -- is this a significant difference?
Forensic ballistics isn't an exact science, is it?
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
Ms. Vin's sister.
I have to talk to your brother.
Gimme back my bottle.
Don't hurt him.
Where's the nearest hospital?
-- With objection!
Your Honor, that's not fair -- !
Objection.
"Art's Supplies" is founded on trust, Mister --
Come now. Did you see the gun?
I can describe it.
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
How can you remember that?
Not the whole time, of course. I --
You're implying that I planted a gun?
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
No. No...
Right. You're right.
I specialize, Roger...
Ten years is a long time.
...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense?
We're taking the other case.
What other case?
Eddie... What's a DD-5?
That DD-5.
What, the lunatic who --
They're just frightened, fucked-up losers that prison fucked up worse.
I didn't ask for a closing argument.
Eddie Dowd.
1530 Rivington Street.
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
So what're we gonna do?
I'm not that desperate.
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
Let's get a cab.
Eddie -- it's Art Esparza!
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
-- What?
"The killer wasn't Chinese"... Cecil Stipe was right. .!
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
...For ten years, now.
You're doing a murder case?
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
I haven't thanked you for your work, Kitty. You're doing good work.
I haven't paid you.
Got any booze in the house?
You don't drink "booze".
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.
My mother find you?
That's right.
Want to tell me what went down here?
Racist asshole came at me.
But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
But why?
Maybe... because someone's afraid.
Afraid of what?
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
-- About what?
About Chinatown. What went down.
What went down?
You tell me, man.
No. You tell me, Shu.
How can I tell you what I don't know!
No.
...I'm dying out there.
It was self-defense.
-- How could I help you?
'lo, Cecil.
No, s-sir.
I'd l-like to answer the question.
Edward T. Dowd.
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
-- alleged crime --
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.
-- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.
You getting this?
It's okay. It was always like that.
Shouldn't one of us...?
What do you want?
I followed you here from court.
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
Look. Mister --
Five years.
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
For control of the prison drug trade?
Yeah, we do some of that.
"Name, rank and serial," Mr. Ortega. Let's not hide behind the Fifth.
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
Shu's the only one I know of...
And why was an exception made?
The phone company was broken up.
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
I want you to kill for me.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
Here he comes.
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
What was?
The stuff we got last night.
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
It's 4:30. We close at five.
What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
Well, where are you going?
I am going over here.
An old woman and her grandson.
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
Congratulations. I heard about that.
HE'S GONE.
Teresa Banks.
Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?
I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
And no one found the ring?
Where is the ring?
Someone else has it now.
That would indicate that it's the future.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
Where am I? And how can I leave?
He's dead -- good and dead.
Sorry to hear it.
Any friends?
Did she ever mention any friends?
How come Jack let's you work here?
No.
That was really something.  That dancing girl.  What did it mean?
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
Sort of shorthand.
Shorthand. Really?
We're heading into a difficult situation.
Lil was wearing a sour face.
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
What did Gordon's tie mean?
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
I don't know, Sam.
Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?
Agent Desmond, it's...
It's late, Sam.
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
She lived alone.
You better dust this place, Sam.
Take a look at this.
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
You didn't do your homework?
When?
The usual, 9:15.
He probably wanted to drive over.
I don't know what to do.
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
Maybe.
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Donna, are you my best friend?
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
Do you want to talk?
If I can smoke it.
You want a muffin?
Goodbye, Muffin.
Where are you going?
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
Where are the Cookies?
You mean Fred and Ginger?
No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.
No, you should forget about last night.
You're not mad at me?
How did the car get back here?
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
What'll it be?
Fill 'er up.
You got it.
Nice night.
You missed somethin', Ed.
I did? I didn't see anything.
Who would do that?
Bob.
But Bob isn't real.
No... No...
I'm not.
Did you make me a tape?
I already made you two tapes.
No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.
I am The Muffin.
Right on time, baby.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
We're on our way, Baby.
Why? It does.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
We were supposed to be together.
I've got to see you.
What about tonight?
I can't tonight.
What the hell is wrong with you?
What do you mean?
You know it and I know it.
Everything, but everything.
Oh, Laura.
You always hurt the ones you love.
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
What?
When he finds out.
What?
You want to see...
Boating?
No.
Hiking?
Eating?
You'd think so.
Sex?
What are you afraid of? What people think?
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
I understand.
Can I take the car?
Laura.
I hate asparagus.
Good night, Mom.
Hi, honey, how's Donna?
Fine.
School?
Let me see.
Who was that?
A friend from school.
We're late to get to your mother.
Are you sure you're okay?
Dad?
Laura. What's wrong this morning?
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
Leland, what are you doing?
Did you get this from your lover?
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
What are you doing?
Who am I?
I don't know.
What's wrong?
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
You're right. There's no one here.
There's no one here.
Mr. Abraham...
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
What did he find?
Nothing.
How good's your intelligence?
Four cases in three years...
The man's an ambulance chaser...
How did you settle on the amount?
We thought it was just.
You thought it was just.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
And no one will know the truth.
What are you doing here?
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
...he wants to testify...?
It looks that way.
To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
This is going to drive the ante up.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
I wouldn't do it.
You would not...?
Yes.
That's not my handwriting.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
I thought I would need it.
Just as you are, Sir...
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
No.
Neurology?
No.
Orthopedics?
I'm just an M.D.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I know of him.
How is that?
Through, through his book.
What book is that?
Meth... Methodology and Technique...
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
How old are you?
I am seventy-four years old.
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
I did.
Ed Concannon.
Objection, we've...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
Nothing further, your Honor.
No further questions.
No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Yes.
Say it.
Anything special about the case?
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
We went to Code Blue...
Well, many reasons, actually...
Tell me one?
And what did your team do...
I completely understand...
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
I didn't do too well for you.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
The Doctors were not negligent.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
I am seventy-four years old.
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
She getting good care over there?
'Code Blue'...
I. Yes. It is.
Dr. Gruber...
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
Yes.
Thank you...
...that's perfectly all right.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
Hi.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
How old is he?
Who told you that?
Mrs. Simmonds.
Kathy Price...
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
Yes.
One hour.
I did.
A single hour.
Yessir. I'm sorry.
Why is that?
What is it?
Thank you for seeing me.
I need an extension for my case.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Ready, your Honor.
Nothing further, your Honor...
I object, your Honor...
Overruled...
D'you find an apartment?
I changed my life today. What did you do?
Why?
The TV didn't work.
What Hotel are you staying at?
And what are you? A cop?
I'm a lawyer.
Really. How wonderful for you.
Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
Maybe what?
What...?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
Do you want me to go...?
Why don't you get some rest?
You're going to stay here...?
Do you think it's my fault?
You're talking like a drunk.
Well, then what are you doing here?
And what makes you so tough?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Not if you don't grow up...
Joe...  Joe...
You're pressuring yourself...
Is it over?
What are you going to do?
Thank you.
Continental Casualty...
Mr. Galvin's...
Hello, I'm calling from...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
From the magazine?
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
How come you're calling me from...?
This is Miss Costello...?
Pardon?
Kathy Price.
We find that your subscription lapsed...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
I've got nothing to say to you.
You know what happened.
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
I didn't do it, Mister.
Who are you protecting, then?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
Then why don't you testify?
It's locked.
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
...I know. I went...
...You saw her?
Dr. Gruber.
He's not in, Sir.
Well, well, well. Huh?
It's a long road that has no turning.
What do you want?
Come on. Let's get a drink.
Are you out of your mind...?
Mick. Mick. Mick...
Right.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
You got a good memory, Franky.
Jimmy? Bushmills.  Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
Oh shit, what's today?
What happened, Joey...?
I can't talk now.
Yeah? How's our new witness?
How are you holding up?
You use their witness.
Yeah. I'm awake.
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
Uh... the admitting nurse...
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
What the hell are you doing here?
What are you doing in New York...?
She told me.
She did?
I just saw her.
Dr. Towler...
Yes, that's correct.
Yes.
...of the procedures...
As I've said we had some more...
What happened in those three...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
What happened in those three minutes...?
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Yes.
How'm I doing so far?
It's an enemy sneak attack.  Let's get outta here!
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
We'd be in all the papers!
That explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move.
Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
Hey, you!  Better get outa here!
I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...
You look kinda lost yourself.
Is that it over there?
Did you see it come down?
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
Did it do you any good?
I do know him...slightly.
What's he like?
How does it happen cars are running?
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
Can you handle one of these?
Is that... machine...?
It's gone now.
Don't you live at home?
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
Nothing there now.
It was...  ...one of them!
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
Colonel - shooting's no good!
That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
They don't do much of anything...!
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.
D.O. to number three..come in.
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
Must be somebody in there.
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
Maybe these are not men - not like us.
What'll we say to 'em?
Which means he's having nightmares again?
He's very excited about it.
You mean that was a...
So I don't know about horror.
Come on.  Kids love horror.
And I...I've got other things happening.
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
I don't follow.
One of mom's cups got broken.
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
You get any sleep last night?
Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
What if it isn't over?
Guess so.
What's up?
Like what?
Like Freddy.
I'll be there in three hours.
Diabetes?
I want my kid out of here now!
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
No way he's going anywhere.  He's been well sedated.
no.
Someone's coming.
Rex saved me.
This is going to give you nightmares.
Tomorrow night.
Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
He's on his way.
I can't sleep there, Mommy.  Please!
In my bed.
Do you have to die to see God?
Why does God let there be bad things?
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
Home.
Dylan, where's the man?
What...what is that?
You okay?
Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
Darker.  More...evil?
You didn't jump in.
Freddy, for all I know.
John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
I know how Chase really died.
What are you talking about?
Fred Krueger did it.
Heather Langenkamp?
Yes?
Is Chase Porter your husband?
I want to see the body.
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
Studio B.
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Listen, dammit.
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
Heather, what is it?
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
It can be captured, sometimes.
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know?
No, not really.  I...
Do you let your child watch your movies?
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
Can I get you something to drink?
Black's fine.
That low passed through last night. May be a little bumpy out there.
Looks like weather.
He would have loved this.
He knows.
You sound so sure.
You may not like what you hear.
Why did we begin this?
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
What are they doing?
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
Everyone aboard young Bill?
Well, that's all part of it.
Everyone out of the rigging NOW!
Carry on.
Why didn't you drop any sail?
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
How old are you, son?
Fifteen.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!
There's still a way.
Make us proud.
Albatross?
She isn't that old.
Where you going?
Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
Believe what?
You okay?
Ninety-six.
Congratulations.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Feels different doesn't it?
What was that?
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
I thought this was your dream come true.
That's not why he's sending me.
Why'd you do it?
What's the difference?
Can we talk?
Well that's just typical isn't it?
Is it true Phil?
We all have problems.
Do you have your ticket?
Yes.
Passport?
Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.
What the hell is going on?
How ya doing?
Fine.
I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
Do what?
My parents don't do it anymore.
Where are you from any way?
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
Who told you that?
My dad.
Jesus, you never told them?
What are they doing?
I can't go in there.
Ah... Northeast... sir.
Northeast sir!
Yes, sir.
You all right?
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
What's on your mind?
Can't do it.
Sir...?
The Dolphin was a symptom.
Of a fight he can't win out here.
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
Chicken is a fool's game captain.
So is violating international law.
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
And, of course, we are.
What is it we can do for you today?
What's wrong, you don't like steak?
I should be eating with the crew.
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
I can take care of myself.
It has nothing to do with him.
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
You do?
What?!  What's happening?!!
Son-of-a-bitch.
What's that?
Jesus.  She's got guns.
Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.
What's your problem?
Don't ever call me stupid.
If you've got "a broad" available I'll take her.
How would you know?
Trust me donut.  I know.
It matters to me.
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
What's wrong Mr. Lawford.
Tie it off!!
We've got a problem.
Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress.
You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.
You're the one who doesn't care, Phil.
It hurts too much to care.
About yourself?
How long you been standing there?
What are we supposed to talk about?
You've gotta be kidding?
Phil.  What are you doing?
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
No.
I'm not gonna kill it.
Swing up, son.
What?
I'm sorry...
Are you hating this?!  Are you!
What makes you so sure it was one?
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
They are much more than that, sir.
I understand.
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
Easy for you to say.
Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
I can dig this music... But not that singer.
So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
This be it?
Y'all take American Express?
What's Cao Ben?
How old are you?
Hey, pretty woman... Sailor here?
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
I'm from all over.
Need a hand?
How 'bout a beer?
That'd be fine, Bobby.
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
Sorry to hear it.
You black?
No.
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
Ready for another?
When did you talk to Lula?
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
...But DAMN man... This better go smooth.
Why should it?
That's right... Take one of these.
Nice of you to drop by.
Told ya I would. You still riled?
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
You heard from Reggie?
No shit?!?! You know him?
Used to.
What'd you say?
That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up...
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
Mostly black though in that boogie place.
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
No... She's fine. Back home.
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
You hitched yet?
No big buildings like in New Orleans.
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
That is my permiso.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
...Asshole.
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
In what capacity?
Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?
Hasta siempre.
Gotta admit, you guys are -  two in four dozen.
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
Who was that?... Who know's your here?
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
That bastard Pucinski...
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
You won't of missed much.
Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do.
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
Why we sittin' here, mama?
I'm scared, mama.
I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
That so?  You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
Sailor?
...are followin' him around.
There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
Sailor!
You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
Come look at this.
It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.
Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it!
What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
It's just another case, Sailor.
You got me, peanut.
I really do think it's the best night of my life.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
Who do?
You think he saw us?
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
Just part of life on the road, peanut.
You ready for this?
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
How much we got left, honey?
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
Lula, you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
What's that?
One bad car accident...
Let's get ahold a' her quick.
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
And no AC.
Fan works.
Sailor?
That you, Sail, honey?
You sick?
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Yeah?
Sailor? You know what?
You been drinkin', huh?
Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
And Bobby too, I hear...
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
Oughta make 'em happy.
So where'd you say you was?
Sail?
Uh-huh?
Let's leave here.
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
What could I be up to, Lula?
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
That was in Vietnam.
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
How can you say that, Sailor?
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
Just a place.
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
You're comin' home, precious. Santos' gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Course I am, mama.
Six.
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
What if I asked you not to?
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
That's not why I called.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
Have it your way... But you want it.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
Take care of him?
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
Get rid of him?
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
Simple? Kill him? How?
That's your business... I don't care how.
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Explain it... I told you.
Shoot him.
Yes.
Where? In the leg?
No.
Where?
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
Yes.
Through the forehead?
See! I knew you had it all under control.
Put your shoulders back.
You got nice tits.
That's just another part of the price to pay.
Santos... Where's J-J-Johnnie?
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
Oh... Look at this... What do you want, snakeskin?
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
You heard right.
You really are one dumb asshole.
I know... I remember.
Well?...
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
You snore.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
Thank you.
Emily?
Your wife.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
She's a transvestite.
You're stoned.
She's still a transvestite.
Mm.
I thought you were tinkering.
You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??
He said something about being between things.
Trip??
She left me. Crabs.
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.
He has a book.
I know. He started it Fall semester.
No. Not yet he isn't.
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
He lives with his mother.
And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
That was good.
Tripp.
Yes.
What's this guy's problem?
Wait here. I'll be right back.
Tripp?!
You stay there.
Kidnapped? By who?
His parents.
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
It's a little late to call Admissions.
So modest.
Crabtree.
Who do you think it is?
The Chancellor's here? Now?
So -- what do we do now?
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
Want some help with that?
So whose car is it?
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
Such as.
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
Kind of a sign, you're saying.
The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.
Do you know he won't expel him?
You peeked, didn't you?
You driving this car?
It's mine.
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
You must be mistaken.
I passed out.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
How long have you been having them?
The last month maybe.
I've been trying to finish a book...
And your wife left you.
Her dog, yes.
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
Better luck next time.
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
No. There's no one here.
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore.
Who the hell is that?
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
Sure.
Sara? Hi. It's Grady.
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
Goodbye, Grady.
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
Sounds like a good one.
You cold, James?
So what are you doing out here?
It's colder in there.
I'll miss my bus.
Go ahead.
Really?
They're glass. The buttons.
It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
I had to. Didn't I?
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
Whose tuba is that anyway?
Can I ask you something about her?
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
Thank you.
I'm okay. I just lost my balance.
Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it.
Want me to get that?
He didn't give his name.
Who?
Afraid so.
That's a big book you're writing.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
Washed up?
Professor Tripp?
How's that?
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
So where have you been staying?
Who?
Isn't this...?
I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.
She seemed to take it pretty well.
Humboldt County?
Glaucoma?
Colon cancer.
Where's that?
Outside Scranton.
What kind of dancer?
Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
Kinship. And what's here?
The one that left you?
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
How can you tell?
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
Jealous? Of me?
You're lying.
It's because you don't eat.
I eat.
When?
Where you going?
I'm not going, with them.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
And we both thank you for that, but we're... we're... fine.
Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
Professor Tripp...?
Thanks for that. He all right?
I think so... What about you?
Me? Sure. Why?
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
Hey.
Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
He cribbed that from Borges.
That good, huh?
Professor Tripp.
I got the message you called.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
You go first.
All right. This morning --
I'm sure.
Emily left me this morning.
Is that Cristaile?
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
Is the thing -- is it over?
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
Who's gun is that?
Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
Pow.
You got me.
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
I heard.
Really? That was fast.
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
About the baby.
Who's that sitting in your car?
Inside.
Someone stole my car.
Are you sure you parked it there?
I think I might have.
And what do you think you might have said?
He told you.
He told me.
And what did you say?
I lost it all.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
I know.
Ouch. How many?
I told Walter.
Does he still love you?
You don't deserve me, you know.
Why yes. How did you know?
That's a nice greenhouse.
Who's he barking at now?
I need a ride.
I'm not sure that's possible.
Listen, Antonia --
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
He's writing his name in water.
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
Walter?
Who's this ?
It's Grady, Walter.
Grady?
It's three-thirty, Grady.
This is important.
Oh?
I... I...
What is it, Grady?
I'm in love with your wife.
Excuse me?
Is it good?
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
Who's that guy?
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
Yo, Traxler.
Do you get high, Sam?
Holy shit. Are you serious?
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
What made you pull out that old thing?
I was thinking of you.
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
Where you stand?
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
A jockey? You mean, like --
The perpetrator.
No, the dog.
I might have his number on campus.
Are you riding with me, James?
There's so many...
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
You want to keep him happy.
Don't need to think fast to handle beer.
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
Foreman now.
No shit.
Five years.
I'll never forget you got me started there.
Hey, is that a school?
Something wrong with that?
I was just thinking of... the noise.
One hundred and twenty feet.
How is she?
Annette? She's good... tense.
When can I see her?
I'm working on it.
Is it because of Anna?
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
What are you doing?
Cherry.
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.
It wasn't like that.
What party?
I've got some good news.
What's that?
Aren't you glad?
When?
Soon.
Next week? The week after?
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
It's not what you think.
You don't have to tell me this.
Carlos, I never raped a woman.
Sure.
Nothing.
Ask me. Ask me anything.
What do you mean?
What are you looking at?
Birds.
There's a million birds here.
They're starlings.
Is that right?
I don't like starlings.
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
A solitary vireo. I like that one.
Their sound is quite musical.
How does it sound?
It's hard to describe.
Try.
I can't.
I'd love to hear it.
Something like that.
That was terrific.
You should hear the bird.
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
I have to go.
Do you come here often?
My daddy likes me home before dark.
See anything interesting?
What are you writing in that book?
Don't you have friends?
I'm not pretty.
Hiya, Walter.
What's up?
You don't know?
I have no idea.
I think you do.
I haven't broken any laws.
I would.
Got something to hide?
Doesn't everybody?
I could get a search warrant.
Cherry?
It's not for sale.
Okay?
Too much sun.
You walked home.
Fairy tales?
Do you believe in them?
Woodsman?
You knew her?
What?
You don't know?
I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
I wasn't feeling well.
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
What's with the boxes?
You're a cop. Figure it out.
I'd say you're moving.
The passionate one?
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
I count my blessings.
So. How are you adjusting?
I'm adjusting okay.
And your new apartment?
Apartment's okay.
Are you taking your medication?
It gives me headaches.
But you are taking it?
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?
I'd keep away from him.
Have you seen Walter?
People have the right to know.
Yeah, like the bird.
I'm twelve.
Walter.
No.
It sounds like you were banished.
Robin?
No thank you.
Are you sure?
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
What's her name?
I can't.
But will he... ?
Your daddy will always love you.
How do you know?
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
Walter?
No.
I don't mind.
You should go home.
Can't I stay a little longer?
It's getting dark. Go home.
And how's your job?
I said the job is okay.
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
You seem a little hostile today.
A diary?
That's right.
No way.
I don't understand.
Ev-i-dence.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
Of course.
It was just an idea.
Reflect.
That's right.
You think reflection is good.
It's very good, indeed.
Try it.
No fucking way.
How's the journal?
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name.
I don't feel anything.
Then why are you talking about this?
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
I'm not that crazy.
Why do you think you're here?
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
How long is this going to take?
We have a few more minutes.
I mean, when will I be normal.
We have a lot of work to do.
Will I ever be normal?
I couldn't say.
You couldn't say.
I suppose it's however society defines it.
How do you define it?
They usually tell me.
What is your idea of being normal?
Fuck you, Rosen!
I know --
You don't know!
I don't know.
What did you think would happen?
I don't know.
Is this the first one?
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
I want to talk about it now.
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
You're very late.
Sorry.
Please don't do it again.
I don't know.
That's not a helpful answer.
Close your eyes.
Why?
To relax.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
I don't see --
Who do you see?
Not so fast.
Sorry.  Where is she?
In my bedroom, sleeping.
Where are you?
In my bed too.
How old are you and your sister?
We're little kids.
And what are you doing?
What the hell are you doing there?
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
Don't ever do that again.
I don't like nobody behind my back!
This is garbage!
You felt pleasure.
Did you get an erection?
I was six years old!
It was a small house.
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
How do you feel about that?
What?
Are you okay?
Want a ride?
I'm all right.
There's something wrong with this picture.
What picture?
I'm talking about you.
Me?
What's weird about that?
Most women wouldn't choose it.
You're quiet at work.
Neither do you.
You never spoke to me before.
Are you?
Is that a school?
K through sixth.
What about bears?
What?
Something happened to you.
I'm not easily shocked.
I get that impression.
So... what's your dark secret?
Why do you want to know?
So?
So, you're not a dyke.
Hey, that was... intense.
You're still here.
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
What's the problem?
You think I have a problem?
Do you?
It's been a while since...
Tell me about it.
Maybe later.
The morning?
I thought I'd stay the night.
I suffer from insomnia.
Hey, there.
Why do you want to know?
The worst?
So, what did you do?
I molested little girls.
Molested little girls?
You're not joking.
What did you do to them?
It's not what you think.
I never hurt them. Never.
What?
Get your kicks somewhere else.
Hey, I'm not --
Depraved? My mistake.
You don't really --
I've changed.
Their power. They seduce me.
They seduce you?
I was always the one seduced.
You really believe that?
No. That's what I used to tell myself.
And what do you tell yourself now?
Nothing. It's over.
You know, this is crazy.
What?
Being here, with me.
What odds?
I got poked around... here and there.
Which brother did this?
All three -- in chronological order.
You must hate your brothers.
I love my brothers.
Are you serious?
Not ever?
What?
You're scared.
I'm not scared.
Neither am I.
We should live together.
Live together.
It's a bad idea.
Just think about it.
I've got problems.
Most people don't have my kind of problems.
Guess that makes you pretty special.
What's this?
Thank you.
Don't be scared, Walter.
I'm not scared.
Don't do that.
Do what?
What's your fucking problem?
What's going on?
I didn't sleep well.
Do you want to talk about it?
You okay?
Yeah.
I heard they were filthy birds.
Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.
She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
You done impressing yourself, ace?
How you guys doing?
Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
Okay so far.
Where are we?
Lord Almighty.
Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.
I can't believe you let them do this!
Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
You never did like being called that, did you?
I think you were worried about me.
I haven't worn mine in months.
Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
But what did he see that made him panic?
What do you think he saw?
You dumb jarhead motherf--
I think it likes you.
He's jammed the mechanism.
You owe me one, Virgil.
You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
You totaled it, huh?
Well, that's that.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
You see where it's coming in?
Son of a bitch!
How?
I don't know how!
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
Oh God, Lins... I--
Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?
'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
No, Bud, no... not you.
Hello, Brigman.
We'll go in through that large breach.
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
Virgil?
God, I hate that bitch.
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
Got it. Over.
Is that it?  Is this right?
He's convulsing!
'Fish'?
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.
Quiet!  Quiet!
SHIT!
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
Cab One, radiation readings?
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
How many are there?
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
Uh, oh...
Hey!
Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
What kind of light?
Would we see the flash?
But your friend is waiting downstairs.
How are you?
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
But where are you going?
Which one shall I wear?
This one is gorgeous.
Claudia, aren't you coming?
I'm certainly not going to swim across.
And how long will you be away?
And have you any other truths to tell me?
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
What is that one over there called?
Well?
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
More so than the shark?
I have a feeling that you're not used to being alone.
Shall we go for a swim?
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
Find anything?
Are you feeling better?
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
Yes, very much so.
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Yes.
Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.
Yes, you should go.
And what about you?
Does it please you to say such things?
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
Why are you looking at me like that?
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
Claudia, let's get married?
But why am I so infatuated with you?
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
Then I'll see you later.
Sandro ...What's the matter?
No, Sandro... Please...
Why?
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
Aren't you going to change?
Why?
Good night, my love.
I love you.
Tell me once more.
I don't love you.
Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
I would say he's pretty depraved.
Have you ever been in love?
What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
But where did you finally end up?
You say that just to flatter me.
I'm not coming.
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
What do you mean by sensible?
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
Please, you come too...
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.
Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?
It's as smooth and slick as oil.
At one time the Aeolian isles were all volcanoes.
I'll stay here also.
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift?
But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
First let the poor thing have something to eat.
Ettore...
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
Where is she going?
Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman.
And where do you find the models?
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
Why don't you try?
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
We have a radio like this, too.
No, not like this one.
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Anything new develop?
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
And do you remember where she got off?
Are you the owner of this place?
No. The owners are in Australia.
But where did you come from?
Whose boat is that?
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
Did you manage to find good rooms?
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Why have we stopped?
You've made some mistake there with the bushes... that's why you can't finish it.
Zuria?
Yes. Until proven otherwise.
I would like to ask you something.
She costs a hundred thousand lire.
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
No.
Through someone else?
Yes.
Who?
I can't say.
Why?
She'd punish me.
One of the other Sisters?
No.
Because I'm getting fat.
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
Agnes...
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
He loves you the way you are.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
Who told you this?
I'm not hungry.
You've got to eat something Agnes.
Of God.
I'm being punished.
Why?
I don't know.
Yes Mother.
We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
I burnt them.
Why?
Yes, Mother.
It's not that... it's not that...
What do you mean?
It's not my time of month.
For what?
You have a lovely voice.
No I don't.
I just heard you.
That wasn't me.
No I'm not.
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
Let's talk about something else.
I don't know.
Anything... may I sit down?
First thing that comes to your mind?
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Love.
Have you ever loved anyone?
Yes.
Who?
Everyone.
Well, who in particular?
Right now?
Uh huh.
Yes.
Who?
Oh, there are so many.
Oh, yes!
Do you think he loves you?
Yes.
At least once a week.
And you like that?
Oh, yes.
Where do you meet?
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
Would you like to talk about it?
Why should they?
No. I was sick.
How were you sick?
Something I ate.
Did it hurt?
Yes.
Where?
Down... there.
I went to my room.
And what happened?
I got sicker.
And then what?
I fell asleep.
Where did the baby come from?
What baby?
The baby they made up.
Is that where they say it came from... ?
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Where'd it come from before that?
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
I... I don't understand.
Agnes, how are babies born?
Would you like to ask them?
What do you mean?
What's your real name?
Martha Louise Livingston.
Are you married?
No.
Would you like to be?
Not at the moment, no.
Do you have any children?
No.
I can't have them any more.
Why not?
I've stopped menstruating
Does it bother you?
One.
Do you know a Marie?
No... do you?
Why should I?
Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
How did she know that?
Who?
I don't know.
Agnes...
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
No.
Do you?
Do you believe she really saw them?
Why not?  Mmm?
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
I could never be a mother.
Why not?
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
I was a mistake.
What the child?
Everything... I don't have children.
And you're unhappy.
Answer me!  You never answer me.
What did you do?
I'm always bad.
What did you do?
No...
You can tell me.
I can't.
She can't hurt you any more.
She can.
How?
She...
Yes?
... makes me...
Yes.
And that you're stupid?
Yes.
That you're a mistake?
How does she know that?
Her headaches.
Oh, yes.
And then...
No I'm not.
Are you pretty?
Yes.
Agnes, you're stupid.
No I'm not.
Are you intelligent?
Yes I am.
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.
I really love you.
As much as Mother Miriam does?
Yes.
Who am I?
Doctor Livingston.
And why am I here?
I'm frightened.
Of what?
How did you have a baby?
It came out of me.
No.
Why?
Because I was afraid.
Why were you afraid?
Because I wasn't worthy.
To be a mother?
Yes.
Did anyone else know about the baby?
I can't tell you that.
Will she be angry?
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
You don't like brussel sprouts?
And then what happened?
We went to chapel for vespers.
What is it?
Someone's following me.
Who?
My bed.
What else?
A wastepaper basket.
What do you think it's there for?
For me to get sick in.
Are you ill?
Yes.
What do you feel?
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
What do you do?
Which one?
Go away, I don't want you here.
Is someone in the room with you?
Agnes, can you hear me?
She said Michael.
Yes.
Who?
How did she know about him?
She'd seen him too.
So she sent you?
Are you frightened?
Not your fault...
Agnes who did you see?
I hate him...
Of course you do. Who was it?
Who?
I hate him.
God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
It was dead.
It was alive wasn't it?
I put her to sleep.
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
???
What?
Look into the convent records.
Eve, she strangled a baby!
Marty, what are you doing here?
Something they... that they overlooked.
I don't know.
What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
Martha, it's you.
Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
All I want is one more week.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
You have proof?
I'll have it.
When?
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
It's your favourite...
Who are you?
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
Who are you?
Oh that one there, in the corner.
Who told you this?
Do you still go to church?
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
Yes... I...
You can call me Sister.
You were a smoker?
Two packs a day.
I can beat that.
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
Is that normal?
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
Who was the father?
I haven't a clue.
What man had access to her?
None as far as I know.
Was there a priest?
Yes, but I...
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
Could there have been anyone else?
And you didn't try to find out who?
What's your opinion?
I believe Agnes is different.
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
So, someone else could have done it.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
And in your eyes?
That's absurd!
Shortly after she came to us.
And you weren't shocked?
And what happened?
This was before her pregnancy?
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
You hate us don't you?
What?
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
Then help her.
There's another choice.
What?
Aquittal.
When would Agnes have conceived the child?
Oh, some time in January.
Visitors to the convent.
Yes.
There's nothing here.
Was the child full term?
Oh, Dear God...
What is it?
The sheets...
You lied to me
About what?
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
Yes.
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
Do you know what she did to her?
I don't think I care to know.
She molested her!
I knew that after the fact.
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
Because I didn't know... 
And my permission?
We'll see about that.
Don't deny it!
I haven't decided yet.
The woman's health is at stake.
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
Bullshit!
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
No, it reminds me.
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Hand rolled.
Even Christ would partake socially.
Saint Peter?
Pipe!
Right...
Do you think they ever existed?
Yes I do.
Do you want to become one?
Listen to her singing.
I'd like to begin.
Begin what?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
May I be present?
Of course.
Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
For the Church?
For Agnes.
You think she's a saint?
The father!
Who is he?
Why must he be anybody?
My God, you're as crazy as...
How  ?
Don't be ridiculous.
But how did it happen?
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
I'm concerned about her health.
Where is she?
I have a few more questions to ask her.
Who knew she was pregnant?
Why do you insist upon pressing...
Is it because she's a nun?
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
I didn't guess until it was too late.
For what?  An abortion?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Too late for what?
The baby?
She didn't want any help.
And the baby.
Before or after you killed the child?
I left it with her and I went for help.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
She can't remember.
Oh, don't do this!
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
Lay them down.
Eh?
Lay them down.
We'd be thrown out.
They're yours.
They are?
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
Shurrup!
I bet you're  -- sixteen!
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
I'm a deserter.
Are you now?
Yeah, I've blown school out.
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
Oh, it's all right.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Why aren't you at work?
What about all these letters?
The police station.
You don't think...
Leave them drums alone.
Spoil sport!
Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
Ever seen one of these before?
I see you go to the night court.
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
Me? Why?
I don't snore.
You do - repeatedly.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
Of course I can.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
Grotty?
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
Get him out of here!!
That's not your Grandfather.
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
A butcher?
Gerron.
Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
Sure. .
What's up?
Ringo!
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
We do.
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
Well ... come on.
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
That must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.
I don't think that bit's right.
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
What are we waiting for?
Morning!  Who's that little old man?
It's Paul's grandfather.
No, I didn't you did ...
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
Go away! You've spoilt it.
Are you supposed to be here?
I've got you worried, haven't I?
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Is it ... is it, really?
Are you pulling my leg?
Something like that.
Gear?
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
Yes.
Aye, I knew you were.
The big hammer?
But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
But that's not like a real person at all.
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
See you.
Books are good!
Parading's better!
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
And what's it all come to in the end?
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
You're only right.
Where are you off to?
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
Oh, they seem all right to me.
What are you doing?
Lip reading.
What are they saying?
Would you two like a cup of tea?
Hello, Grandfather!
Hello.
And we're looking after him, are we?
Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Why do you always use your left hand?
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
No, that's his other one.
That's all right then.
Clean though, isn't he?
Is that yours?
What are you doing there?
What little old man?
That little old man.
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
Give 'em a pull.
I hope he fell off.
Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
Let's go and muck in.
Behave...
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
What's old got to do with it?
You needn't bother.
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
No.
Now get on with it.
Let's have you.
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
You wouldn't!
They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.
Hi Norm!
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
Tonight? We can't make it ...
You've got a midnight matinee.
Hello.
No, not me.
Oh you are, I know you are.
No, I'm not.
You are.
I'm not, no.
My eyes are lighter.
And my nose...
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
I would have said so.
Aye, but you know him well.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
That's what you tell me.
What have you heard?
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
You're a window rattler, son.
It'll only get you into trouble.
He's betrayed the class.
Oh, leave off!!!
That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
Well!
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
I've got the stuff. Come here.
Aren't we ...
What do you think are you're up to?
Do I have to raise me voice?
Yeah, you want to watch it.
Well, you stick to that story, son.
I'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller than you.
Who?
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Down the ... er ...
Oh, down the ... er ...?
Yeah, down the ... er ...
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
What?
Nerves.
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
Eh, what's all this?
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
I'll set John on you!
So you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.
Oh... God... am I cold...
I feel like shit...
Locked.
Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
... I don't know...
Where's Irth?
I don't recognize that constellation.
Can you get it a little closer?
Any rotation?
Yeah.  Two hours.
Is it solid?
It's... basalt.  Rock.
Just machinery.
What is it?
Maybe we can get in by the top.
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
How do you feel, Dell?
Wretched.  What happened to me?
Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
A transmission?
I have recorded the transmission.
Computer, what language was that?
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
How long to fix?
Hard to say.
Well, get started.
Hello, Faust!
<u>He</u> died.
What?
You like this shit?
Okay.
What happened to the lights?
What happened?  Where's Sandy?
Dead.
What the hell's going on?
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
Oh -- God -- oh --
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
And when will you be ready to do that?
It's really on there tight.
Hey, guess what?
What?
Might even incinerate the damn thing.
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
Right. 
Where did it come from?
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
God, that smoke's poisonous!
But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
It makes me sick to see him like that.
It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
It's over, Hunter.
Hey now, what is this?
There.  Should be coming through about there.
I'll do it.  The rest of you continue.
Yes?
How's Broussard?
He's running a fever.
Still unconscious?
Sounds like a rough one.
We've got six hours left.
Oh my God.
<u>How</u>?
Should we go outside and bring him in?
It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.
Now what's wrong?
I've completely lost their signal.
Can you get them back?
No.
What do you mean, no?
How many?
I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.
Look at that.
What's happening up here?
This is horrible.
What common objects?
Don't count on it.
We can use the flamethrower.
What's the frequency?
Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?
That way.
What's wrong?
It's close, real close.
Air lock?
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
No, it's coming.
<u>What is it</u>?
It's stopped?
No, thank God... just missed him.
Is it still dripping?
The commander normally has first publication rights.
They're on the next level up.
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
That tube must be depositing it in him.
We do know that.
Where are we?
Oh my God.
It's out of focus.
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
What the hell happened?
10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Good!  Moisture content?
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Any microorganisms?
Not a one.  It's dead.
Anything else?
Martin, uh, we've found it.
But?
Still worried?
This ship is full of cat hair.
Hey, can you guys hear me?
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
Take us up.
Where are you?
Food-storage room!
What's it doing, having a seizure?
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
Two down, four to go.
What's that supposed to mean?
Can you make out any pattern in all that?
Which presumably means...
All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
Kill me...
That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
I'll get you out of there.
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
What can I do?
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
Better?
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
It's a rhino.
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?
Let's get back and call this in.
Nice howitzer you've got there.
Minh...
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
Seal everything now!
What's happening?
How many of them are there?
Give or take.
Are you alright?
Where is she?
I found it...
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.
Picking up velocity.
It's too late!
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
Has anybody talked to them?
Not yet.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
Something spooking the rhinos?
Hey, Guttierez?
There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
Whoa, wait a minute...
What?
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?
Forget it, man.
Alright, okay.  Look...
What?
But I'm going first...
Careful of that edging there...
Hold it, hold it...
What's wrong?
Wait.  Lost it.
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
It's alright, it's cool...
Is this the suit?
They've changed their heading again.
They knocked out the external feeds.
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
Okay, we're in business.
Okay, I'm out of here!
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
Four.
And before that?
Six month stint on Datus.
Only six?
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
What is that?
Seltzer?
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
I've found Ackland!
Think I spoke too soon...
That's the wrong way!
Hurry it up.
I... I can't!
You have to...
How's it going?
You should hit the sack, too.
What time's sundown?
'Bout five minutes.
Give me a yell is something happens.
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
And what is your name?
Phoebe.
Phoebe?
May I come in?
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.
Eddie...
I'm about to go into the shower, I won't be able to hear you...
You take charge.
Hungry?
I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
Just like that, eh?
I don't think that's funny.
D-day.
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
Aren't you?
All paved with diamonds and gold?
You know me better than that.
What time?
Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
We're?
I didn't mean just the Theater.
So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the Theater, after all...
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
I see. And when was this unholy alliance joined?
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
What do you take me for?
I never intended you to be.
What have you got to do with it?
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
I can't believe my ears...
You're too short for that gesture. Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.
She was a liar, she was a liar!
Then say so.
I won't play tonight.  I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...
You can have one at Max's.
I don't think I'm going.
Why not?
No, it's not.  It's for this.
It's the same thing, isn't it?
That isn't a waiter, my dear. That's a butler.
Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler," can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler...
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
Answer me this. What makes a man become a producer?
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
She was magnificent.
Then you've heard too.
I was there. An eyewitness.
Margo.
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
We have that in common.
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
Miss Caswell got lucky too late. The audition is over.
Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
Eve! My understudy...
Didn't you know?
Of course I knew.
How... how was Miss Caswell?
Frankly, I don't remember.
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
Huh?
You've already met.
Where?
Right here. A minute ago.
Good luck, genius...
Nothing?
Only in some ways. You're prettier...
Can't keep his eyes off my legs.
She's quite a girl, that what's-her name...
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
Take care of yourself out there...
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
And cut that out right now.
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
Knit me a muffler.
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
You're my girl, aren't you?
That I am...
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
Many happy returns of the day...
I get a party, don't I?
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
Yeah... I will.
How is Eve? Okay?
Okay.
I love you...
I'll check with Eve...
It's a good thought.
Happy little housewife...
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
I thought you were going to be late-
When I'm guest of honor?
She's a girl of so many interests.
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
For instance what?
Thank you.
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
It's all over.
What's all over?
What fire and music?
Who?
I must have frightened her away.
I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
Don't mix your metaphors.
I mix what I like.
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
I will not calm down!
Don't calm down.
I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
It's obvious you're not a woman.
Well, I am.
I'll say.
Margo, let's make peace.
Then what would be enough?  If we were married?
Bill...  ... where are you going? To find Eve?
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
It's only for the license. There's a three-day wait - blood tests, things like that...
I understand she is now the understudy in there.
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
Never try to outguess Margo.
Groom.
A cowboy.
A married lady.
Hello, what's your name?
Why?
Why.
Why you have to go out there.
I don't have to. I want to.
Is it the money?
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
It's only one picture deal.
Also Addison deWitt.
Every day.
Thanks for your help... good luck.
Is that what you want me to be?
Don't run away, Bill.
From what would I be running?
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
- and for you.
You're quite a girl.
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
Lemme fix you a drink.
What did you expect - live sables?
Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-
It was Fort Sumter they fired on-
You need new girdles.
The same size?
How do you do, my dear.
Oh, brother.
I'm sure you must have things to do in the bathroom, Birdie dear.
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
Kill the people.  Got your key?
Adorable. We now got everything a dressing room needs except a basketball hoop.
Birdie-
You don't like Eve, do you?
An answer.
No.
Why not?
Now you want an argument.
She works hard.
Night an' day.
She's loyal and efficient-
Like an agent with one client.
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.
Late for what?
Don't be dense. The party.
Who are you?
Miss Harrington...
What are you doing here?
You were just looking around...
That's all.
What for?
You probably won't believe me.
It was for my report.
Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.
The maid'll fix it in the morning.
Subway.
It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.
That's the door.
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
Oh, no...
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
I thought you'd forgotten about me.
If I only knew how...
Try...
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
Not just that way. As a friend...
Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.
Mrs. Richards.
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
I think she would cheer.
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
Of course.
You won't forget it?
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
May I have your coat?
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
We're having lunch with a movie talent scout.
They certainly don't waste much time.
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
I don't intend to be.
There can't be very much-
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
Eve... don't cry.
But the raves about your performance-
He's not my friend. You were my friends...
I think I know...
If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
Congratulations, Eve.
Hello, Miss Harrington.
No, thank you.  Yes. I've seen every performance.
There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
Well - if I'm not in the way...
I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
While you're cleaning up, I'll take this to the wardrobe mistress-
Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
If you'd like.
Good evening, Mr. deWitt.
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
You've what?
She's just outside the door.
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
How much time have we?
Roughly ten minutes.
How far to the station?
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical-
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
Do you want it on?
It doesn't matter.
Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
What about Bill?
What about Bill?
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
Not to you. Not to Bill.
I remember.
How was the concert?
Coming?
Eve.
I'm beginning to catch up.
You've got to admit it would be a novelty.
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
Well of all-
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
- well? What happened?
What's so funny?
Who is it? What's it all about?
Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?
I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
Where is she?
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
How do you mean?
Margo, you haven't got any age.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
You'd have been proud of her.
I'm sure.
To you, too?
You've been talking to that venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt-
Karen and I just don't want an accident-
I have no intention of having an accident!
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.
That depends.
I mean really, deeply angry...
I don't think I could be.
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
I placed...?
"Liebestraum."
I just played it.
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
Margo. You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...
When's the audition?
Would you?
All you got to do is name it.
Promise.
I promise.
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
Are you breaking the contract?
I didn't hear you.
What the hell were you doing rewriting my story--
--it was fine the way it was--
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
--mine's better--
--no way--
What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
Carl?
Yeah?
It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
All right, what do we know?
--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
Hey?
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
July of '71.
What's that?
Goddamnit--
--see?--
--I'm trying--
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
This is terrific work, if you like rejection.
Republican?
When?
'68.
Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
--we will--
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
You want me to be the bastard.
--The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin--
Goddamnit--
--shit--
--we gotta top the Times--
--shit, who do we know?--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
I think that's him.
Who?
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
Woodward?
You overslept?
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
--what time is it?
11:30.
Morning or night?
Night.
I'll never get out of here in time.
Hi, it's me. I'm still here.
I'm so glad.
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?
Donald Segretti?
You can't.
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
I know where Dwight works.
I didn't do anything wrong.
Tell that to Muskie.
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
I didn't.
Chapin did contact you then?
Sure--off the record.
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--
Absolutely--
I think.
Give me your checkbook then.
There's always a later plane.
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
You've really got to go.
The ones who could disburse the money.
So tell me about the Times article.
What do you want to know?
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
--then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
But they both worked at the White House?
I really can't talk now--
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--
What's this?
Just tell me his title.
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
We can't talk inside either?
--I'm not here.
What I don't understand is how you got here.
They are not my clients.
Are you implying you don't believe me?
You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
Where?  What do you mean, where?
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
...you're definitely doing a story...?
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
Who?--be specific. How high up?
There were more then.
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
Your name, please.
James McCord.
Security consultant.
Where?
Government. Recently retired.
Where in government?
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
Where?
I think so.
Are you sure?
I couldn't say.
I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
--you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
What'd you get on W.House?
--who you got?--
Anyone but Bernstein.
Howard--
--remember Toronto, Harry.
--has any of them got an ax?--
--no--
--which Young?
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
A boy or a girl?
The what to what?
You work there, Miss Abbott.
What the hell was that?
Sorry.
No, it was good.
Good work, Ostreicher.
Thanks coach.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
Great evening, isn't it?
What did you just say?
Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for letting us have a great party.
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
All right, I got some scotch.
So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
This is your plan, Finch?
This.  Right now.
Of course, Finch.  What?
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
What are we gonna hear?
What do you suppose they're saying?
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Just go!
Why is this?
Not bad, Chris.
Um...Chris --
You can call me Oz.
Do I have to?
You can call me Ostreicher.
What's your middle name?
Forget it.
Come on!  I won't tell.
Nice car.
I'm glad you think so.
I wasn't making fun of you.
Why are you doing this?
How did you know I was here?
Stifler told me.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
That's nice.
Onions?
What?
I know.  Salt and pepper?
So we're gonna be close next year?
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
What about the game?!
I'm not playing.
You're missing the game for us?!
Oz, it's okay, I know.
Yeah right.
You mean...and orgasm?
You got it, stud.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
No you haven't.
But that one time --
Do you?
Of course.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Did you guys hook up or something?
Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.
Give it to me!  Yes!
Don't you love my sexy body?!
Fuck me!  Yes!
And you said...
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
There's our man.
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
Gotta go.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
Right.  That gives us...
I have no idea.  Finch showers in a bathing suit.
Hey, where's Finch?
Did I miss anything?!
Please, God.  Let this be it.
Holy shit.
How do you know that?
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
Back out?  You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid.  You afraid or something?
What the heck is this?
Can I come in?
Yeah, sure.
You're not...busy?
Dad!  I know!
Do you know about the clitoris?
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Son.  This lady's here for you.
What was your name again?
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
Don't you want me to?
She's a mermaid, dude.
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
I still think you're okay.
I'll just say that we had a great night together.
After getting laid?
What's up, fellas?
You've got something going?
Yes.
No...you...go...ahead.
So you need to change, right?
Well...uh...
Shame on you!
Strip?
You mean like, <u>strip</u> strip?
Uh...
Jim...
Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?
Kevin, this is serious!
Let me know.
Vicky, wait.
I think "shithead" really says it.
Oh...ungghhhhh!
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
I think you're so right, Kevin.
You want to do it?
Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
You comfortable?
Yeah, are you?
You sure you're comfortable?
Yeah.
Me too.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
That was a great night.
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
Does it tell me how to get laid?
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Qualify for what?
Then she said -- she loves me.
You ever hear of something called The Bible?
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
Feeling better, Oz?
I'm such a loser.
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
So does your tongue cramp up?
...Guess what?
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
NOVA!!
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
I think you need your balls reattached.
Keep it down, dude.
You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
Our last game is this Saturday.
Here, babe.
Really?
Merde! Just missed!
Just like sex with my wife.
The key is don't look down.
Also like sex with my wife.
God. How can you eat like that?
Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.
Who gives a shit? I've had it up to here with arrogant Frenchmen.
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
Sure. I can follow that.
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
Salots! Shitfucker!
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
Andy! Holy shit!
What about your glasses?
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
Hello?
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
I don't... I... I can't remember...
I know. He told me.
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
Are you crazy!?
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
We don't both have to die.
I know where he'll go.
Didn't even have to ask.
God. I can't believe it.
What?
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
Well, they are French.
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
Okay. Be careful.
Oh God. Shit...
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
You on drugs? Huh?
Pull over! Now!
In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Encul d'Americain.
Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
Or else what? You'll kill me?
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
Do you think I'm an idiot?
Another step and he's dead!
Ha. Some wonder drug...
You recognize her?
We know you were with her.
He was a good man. Now his wife is a widow.
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
Andy...
I don't believe we've been introduced.
It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.
Uncle Terrence?
Andy? Andy is that you?
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -
Now!
Merde.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
Why were you so late tonight
I was showing Sonya something . . .
What were you showing her?
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
Hurry, Grandmama!
Are you running away?
I have to go now, before it gets light.
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
Well, I don't have any money . . .
I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
Is everyone all right?
Did I tell you that?
Come out! I can do alterations.
You'll laugh.
I shant!
Yes, your highness.
Poor Meetoo!
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
Ouch!  That really hurt!
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
Why do you want to go to Paris?
By pulling my hair?!
Just what do you think you're doing?!
Forged papers! Now, what?!
Come on!
You must enjoy causing me pain!
Every Russian family has one..
It's the best fork of all
You said you wouldn't laugh!
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
Oh! I'm sorry...
I'm so scared...
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
Dmitri?
Don't let me go!
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
Dmitri didn't want the money?
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
And this is my future. This is who I am!
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
Trust me, it's her!
Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
I'm getting a chest cold..
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
It's her.
He's her?
She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
What do we do now?
See? The Princess is under there ...
How is our current financial status?
The "Odessa Dunk"?
But it's not	the money, Vlad.
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
I'll show you!
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
Please, if you'd just listen...
You are the boy ...
Promise me she'll have her home.
She does.
And tell me that she's happy.
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
I had nothing to do with it!
You gave the orders!
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
I'm... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford.
This guy's on television! Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?
This guy's on television.
Can I have your autograph?
Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
Hey!
What?
Who's on television?
Singer!
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
It's an important issue.
Who are you?
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
What do you mean, next?
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
Allison.
Yeah? Allison what?
Well, why not?
Yeah, Earl Warren?
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
I missed my therapy. I overslept.
How can you possibly oversleep?
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
That movie makes me feel guilty.
Alvy, I...
What-what-what-what's the matter?
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Don't give it to me. Don't!
Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
Well, no... not just, not only.
Uh... you-you wanna lift?
Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
Me? Oh, downtown!
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
Oh - you're an actress.
No, Chippewa Falls.
Right!  Where?
Wisconsin.
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
For yuh.
All right.
I'll getcha a piece.
Oh, right.
Nice car.
You want your tennis stuff?
Huh? Oh... yeah.
Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...
Yeah, I know.
Well...
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You sure?
No, I got time.
Oh, you see an analyst?
Sylvia Plath.
Oh, yeah.
Neat?
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.
No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
Fifteen years, yeah.
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh?
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
what I mean?
No, so help me.
I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice.
Yeah!
Yeah?
Hey, listen, listen.
What?
Oh, all right.
Okay.
Okay?
We can digest our-
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
As Balzac said...
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
Good? I was-
Hey?
Yeah?
big subject with me, yeah.
M'hm.
M'hm.
Look, look at that guy.
You see, like you and I...
You are extremely sexy.
Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
You- Do you love me?
That's the key question.
Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
Yeah.
Don't you think I do?
Of course.
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
I have a tiny apartment.
Yeah, I know it's small.
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
Really?
I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Are yuh?
You followed me. I can't believe it!
I didn't follow you!
Well, what is your definition of following?
Following is different. I was spying.
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
David? You call your teacher David?
I'm home!
M'hm.
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
Sinatra?
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
Will it change your wife?
Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
David! David! I can't believe this!
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
I'm following you and David, if you-
What's- It's me, open up.
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Yeah, where is the spider?
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Oh. What?
Very big spider.
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
snow shovel or anything or something.
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
Oh, Jesus, really?
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.
-me, my God, it's a great day!
Yeah, but it's real close.
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
Here's a real present.
Remember, we had that thing.
Thing?
yes, we had, uh...
Christ!
Yeah, this place is great.
Oh, good. Okay.
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
God.
Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
Oh!
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
This is my room.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
What'd I do?
Step up here!
What'd I do?
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
Why are you so hostile?
Oh, I'm sorry!
Don't get upset!
I can't.
What-
Oh, you got a headache!
I have a headache.
Bad?
Oswald and ghosts.
Man, that's great. That's just great.
You have a raccoon?
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
Are you?
Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
Key word here is "indulgent."
without getting... well, let's put it this way...
Probably on their first date, right?
Oh.
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
Charlie Chaplin.
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
Sixteen years ago.
Whatta you mean?
Ah, Max, you, uh...
Right, Max. California, Max.
Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
Yeah, watch the road!
Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.
Max, I've got a hit series.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
Well, sit down.
Oh, Jesus.
You all right?
I don't know, I mean, I-
How about a ginger ale?
You like this house, Max?
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
V.P.L.?
M'hm.
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
Max, are we driving through plutonium?
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
His wife has diabetes!
You fired the cleaning woman?
She was stealing.
So the colored have enough trouble.
She was going through my pocketbook!
They're persecuted enough!
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
Oh, you remember her, Annie.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
You think so? Do you really?
Oh.
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
Oh.
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
Yeah.
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
I was a great beauty.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
I was very charming.
There were many men interested in you?
Oh yes.
Did you know the contractor?
Very well.
It's the way they do things.
Did you see permits?  Did he have a license?
So who won?
A triumph.  When did you get here?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
You're not upset that I brought the dog?
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
Absolutely.
Had a little help?
Absolutely not.
It has your ring.
Isn't Skye amazing?
She's got great tits.
She's a constant surprise.
No, what?
Leo?
I have a small window of time.
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
She already has.
Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth.
Things always look much worse in the morning.
What what's about?
Why didn't you bring him?
What?
Why didn't you bring him?
He's allergic.
Oh.
To dander.  Otis.
Oh.
Didn't I say?
Borrow whatever you like.
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
Just don't fucking tell her.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Don't you miss it?
Never.
You should have brought him.
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
Let's get the kids.
Would you leave us alone right now?
He's gonna miss his flight.
Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
Take good care of it.
I'm the hired help.
That for us?
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
Can I open it?
Sally?
Just did.  Jealous?
When does he graduate high school?
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
So?
What is it?
The suspense is killing me.
Harry called.
And?
But she's alright.
Stupid tart.
She left a note.
You need to call your dad.
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
And you know our friends, how?
We live next door.
Oh.  You're them.
We've heard lots about you.
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
Cal, my wife Judy.
Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys. Hey!!
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
There's a test, you know.
You're crazy baby.  I love you.
Oh yeah...
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
Oh yeah?
Let me heal you, baby.
I call that a perfect day.
Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
Hm.  We should do it again.
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
Not as a rule.
Go.
Hey!  Would you?
It was fifteen seconds.
I don't think so.
He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room?
I'm fine, babe.
Give him a minute, Clair.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
Anytime, sport.
We closed.
We've only been over this how many times?
You only made half your quote this year.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
Not millions.
He's directing now.
There's still time to undo this.
We'll be fine.
Did you invite them?
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
Whatever you say.
Yes.
Did he promise?
You're out of your mind.
Take your time, Jer.
Ryan's novel.
Happy anniversary, baby.
Hardly...
No.  Did you?
We're great.
I mean, you're really back.
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
I'm going to throw up.
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.
In the kitchen.
Two minutes.
Okay, knock it off.
Truce?
Truce.
Dinner.  Don't be angry.
Dolphins.  Great.
She left the fucking gate open.
He'll find his way back.
Fuck you.
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
And how hard it hit?
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
What are you saying?
Cal, too?
Sally, for Christ's sake.
Anyone else?
This is insanity.  Sally...
Don't.
Don't push me away.
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
You changed your mind.
What?!  You aborted our child?!
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
Yes.
I'll never forgive you.
I'll be with you.
I don't want to go tonight.
Me too.
That's under lock and key.
Happy anniversary.
It's a Calder.
I know.
He's my favorite.
I know.
Panes!  How are you?
Oh, you know, I am.
What's a sign for that?
Coffee?
Sure.
We have a gift?
Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
It's a novel.
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
Not long.
Don't be silly.
Ours.
You lose this?
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
Well, you know...good days, bad days.
I meant Sally.
I meant Sally.
You're an interior decorator, right?
Uh-huh.
I'm a little nervous, so...
A little out of my element.
And you know, he really does not.
Scout's honor.
I need to leave you now.
I will treasure this.
Lemon or raspberry?
Lemon.
Ryan's really angry with me.
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
That's a lot of those.
Medallions.
A lot of cakes.
Yes.
How long have you been married?
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
You must have been a baby.
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
That's very nice.
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
I think there are sixteen there.
Of course it's alright.
What?
Jesus Christ.
How's he doing?
Ryan.
Well, yes, actually.
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!
Don't go in, Ryan.
What?
Hi.  Monica and Ryan?
Sally?
We could hardly say no.
Hors d'oeuvres or something?
Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
I so wish I'd known.
Well, whoever did this is amazing.
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
I'm so sorry.
I...
Is there space here?
Yes.
Do you need anything else?
I was impressed.
Oh?
The charades.
Thank you.
That was my clue.
Oh?
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
Yeah.
If he were still alive, maybe.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
Good, you brought your violin.  I want you to play.
Are you lovesick?
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
Will champagne help?
Panes is here!
She's even better looking in the flesh.
You don't know she's a bitch.
She's all over him, are you blind?
It could be worse.
Fuck you, Panes.
Like your business managers?
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Like the last time.
I wasn't finished.
It's our anniversary, Panes.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
We're just feeling our way back.
"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
What does that mean?
So how are you really doing, Panes?
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
I'm worried about your Galiano.
You're a shit.
Yes.  Fine.
That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
You're my best friend.
That's not an answer, is it?
Thank you, Panes.
You don't need to thank me.
You're keeping a record, are you?
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.
You don't need to do that.
I don't mind...
Enough about me.
He's a novelist.
Like Joe.
I hope they're watercolors!
Isn't this a fabulous picture?
She's such a great photographer.
So where should I put it?
It's much more personal in here.
A notch above the storage room.
Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.
I trust you.
Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
You weren't exactly horrified.
I don't have a drug problem.
We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
Why are you doing this?
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
Invisible!
Someone who follows his heart!
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
Are you sure this is a real dance?
You're right!
Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!
Wait!  When can I see you again?
And you are...?
No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
You dance...
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
What <u>was</u> that thing?
Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
Worker!  Come back here now!
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
Want a list?
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
Hlllllllp!
Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
And only you can become a Queen?
Well...no, but --
We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'
Why do they have you tied up here?
The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different.
There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
I'm the Princess, aren't I?
Of course --
And do Princesses do improper things?
Bala!
I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork?
BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!
Z!  Over here!
I wonder...what...was it all...for...
Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Oh, no, sir!
Good.  You're a good soldier.
So tell me.  Where's Z?
I...I have no idea, sir.
That's correct, sir!
Not that one.  Or that one.
Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
May I cut in?
What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
All these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>.
Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
Why are we so successful?
We declared war again?  Are you scared?
Hey, did you hear what he said?!
I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
I can't think of any.
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
Wear this.
You're a real buddy.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now <u>dig</u>!
My mother.
This the place?
I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
Not there.  Under the mat.
So this is your mother's apartment?
Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?
I've been here twice as long as you have --
Shall we say -- a dollar?
Morning, Mr. Baxter.
Say, you got a lulu.
Yeah.  I better not get too close.
You should have stayed in bed this morning.
Good night.
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
No.
Would you like to?
You mean tonight?
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
I forgive you.
One more?
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
Three.
You all right? What's the matter?
This is a bad day for me.
What is it?
Don't you remember? We were at the office party together --
I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --
I just want to go brush my teeth --
Here. How about some breakfast?
No -- I don't want anything.
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
Who?
Someone from the office.
And where are you now?
In his apartment.
His apartment?
I mean -- her apartment.
What's your friend's name?
What's her first name?
When are you coming home?
Something wrong with your legs?
No -- it's my stomach.
Your stomach?
He doesn't give a damn about me.
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
I am. Let me get the cards.
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
I don't want it.
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
I'm sure that's the explanation.
You really think so?
No doubt about it.
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Sure.
Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
Who'd care?
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
There's a call for you --
For me?
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
Are you supposed to?
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
I guess so.
I know so. He's a taker.
Where?
Here.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
Are we dressing for dinner?
No -- just come as you are.
Shall I light the candles?
I see you bought some napkins.
The dishes?
I mean, after that?
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
Fine. How's your eye?
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
Oh.
That's very wise.
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Are you sure? How's your knee?
I'm fine all over.
Mind if I come in?
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
I don't know.
The Vice Squad?
I'm not through with you yet.
Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
Relax, Baxter.
You know how people talk.
Oh, you don't have to worry --
Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
Well -- I guess so.
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
Put me down for Thursday again.
Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
You like?  It's all yours.
Now I'll have to borrow your key.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
How's that again?
I dig.
Now you're being bright?
Baxter?
All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
No, no -- just had a little accident.
You?
Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
Hi, Baxter.
What do you want?
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
I sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, I'm very sorry --
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
Good evening, Baxter.
She going to be all right, Doc?
What's her name?
Hello, Miss Kubelik.
Any of that coffee left?
How do you spell her last name?
How's the patient?
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
Well, I have things to do --
You like Castro?  I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?
Who is Mickey?
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
No.
Family?
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
No.
Not so rough, honey.
Good night.
Good night?
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
Who?
No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
I see.  What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
That guy really must've belted him.
Doctor.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Dreyfuss.
Tell me again -- what's my name?
Dr. Dreyfuss.
And what happened to you?
I took sleeping pills.
No.
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?
You fool -- you damn fool.
Come on, Fran.
Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
Still afraid somebody may see us together?
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
How long has it been -- a month?
Six weeks. But who's counting?
I missed you, Fran.
It's been hell.
How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
Remember what we talked about?
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
You're not being funny.
Handle what?
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
You know I do.
I have that date -- remember?
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
Okay.  I just thought as long as it was paid for --
Stop that, Fran.
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
I told you -- with my mother.
Where does she live?
A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Go where?
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
Did you have a nice Christmas?
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
See if they'll what?
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
Yeah --
What's it matter? Get to the point.
Look -- you know the girls -- Thta's Terri -- she was playmate of --
I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
I like all of them --
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
My men --
You're out of your skull --
No -- absolutely not --
One for all -- all for one --
Get out --
Who the hell are you?
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
How about a drink ?
Winning the war by yourself.
Part.
Which part is that ?
Delta ?
North ?
Yeah. Way north.
None.
Rangers, eh?
Were you Longe Range Recon --
Tracks ?
Yeah.
Fat. That's real fat.
We do.
How long were you up there ?
Chef.
Yes, sir --
Why they call you that?
What are you doing out here?
Cook school -- that did it.
What do you see?
Probably is.
Whatdoya think it thinks.
That's a light down there --
Charlie?
Looks that way.
Who's he?
He killed that guy without feeling anything.
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
Can I go get those mangos now?
Smoke !
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em.
We could go in tomorrow at dawn -- there's always off-shore wind in the morning.
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge.
What're you trying to say, Captain --
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
What the hell is it?
They're not Cong.
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.
When'd you do it?
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
Signs?
Listen.
What is it?
Which way? Right or left?
Who knows? Right.
Anybody see some smoke ?
Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
I only met Kurtz once.
You didn't like him.
Our Recon flight ?
Ours.
Terminate ?
Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?
Yeah, it still runs.
Do me a favor buddy, please.
Spooky.
What -- happened here.
How did they know?
Yeah.
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
No, sir.
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
I thought he was a lame.
Well, he's killing now.
A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.
Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.
What's your name, sailor ?
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
Where've you been riding, Lance?
Good swell.
They far enough?
Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !
Boss left.
How big it is?
Change.
It's still pretty hairy, sir.
Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels Four -- bring it in on along tree line and huts.
Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees.
Haiphong.
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
No. Walked.
What'd you do for supplies?
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
When did you hear?
I met him.
You'll find enough Cong up there.
Who?
It's gonna blow this place out. It's gonna ruin it ...
Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
Do you know me?
Do you?
Yeah, I like it...
You can't have water after morphine.
How's the pain?
How's yours?
Gimme water.
I think think a lie stinks.
Go away -- hide yourself.
What are you doing?
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
I had immense plans.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Yes...
Did you know him very well?
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
Maybe he'll get tubed.
No -- no, Captain.
This one , Lance?
When?
You think?
The other one --
Captain Willard?
Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.
This boat's a mess.
Why did they attack us?
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
Who are you?
I'm sorry to hear that.
I should be checking on the boat.
What's a big question?
Yes.
I know.
Are you warm, Captain?
What if I say no.
Right now -- I am.
This -- Bob Hope or the like --
That's 27, sir.
You came right to it, son of a bitch --
Where's your chief supply officer?
Beverly Hills --
23   CONTINUED:
102  CONTINUED:
Avalanche season is coming.
Let's go.
184  CONTINUED:
212  CONTINUED:
A certain sonofabitch bastard -more-
39   CONTINUED:
Had?
She's dead.
You should know something.
What happened here?
The radio's on the fritz.
Where'd you say Eric is?
Stay here.
I call it 'the Turtle,' as in carrying your home on your back.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
That's not what I meant.
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
Let's go.
Be careful, okay?
What's going on?
I'll tell you everything later.
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
Had no choice...  ...Given the situation.
Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
You got two counts against you -- trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
Desmond.
New to the country, kid?
Does he have people?
I'm not gonna carry you out of here.
We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.
Be my guest.
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
There's a cabin, maybe twenty miles south of here.
Have to get these wet things off.
Told you I'm fine!
How many do you see?
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
You don't feel cold?
It was blown up with the plane.
I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
Don't bet on it.
I already have.
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
You broke the radio, remember?
Shut up!
Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.
Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
You wouldn't shoot anyone...
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
I need to rent a cabin.
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
Alleged killer.
Bet you're right.  But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
What'd you say they call these spaceships?
Hey, Sam, look over there.  Black and white smoke.
I'm too old for this shit.
That's what we should've done in the first place.
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
Get the fuck out of here.
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
I ain't gonna leave a seven- hundred-dollar Remington behind.
Thought that door was open last night...
You hear me?  Ben?
Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
...Ben never sent a signal.
Meaning he'll need a plane.
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
Huh?
What is it you want? What?
Call me as soon as you're settled.
I'm sorry.
Don't be silly. How bad?
Hi...  Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
He's good...  And I'm an expert on doctors.
Do you love me?
Emergency room only.
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
I'm starving.
I know. He's just the best.
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
His name?
Spencer.
Okay.
So what are you doing with a dog?
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Sorry.
How do you know about my mother?
Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
Uh, Udall?
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
Note. Put it in the note.
I'm not kidding.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
Nice of you... thank you.
The stiff one eye?
Two days.
I can't. I work.
My son.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
What's that got to do with it?
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Hello?
Are you still coming?
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
I was going to do that for you.
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
And mean it...
Fries.
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
Never.
I'll never forget you said it.
I don't want to hear that music right now.
I don't.
I'll take a bus.
Hello.
Yeah... Well...
How you doing?
I can trust my brain.
Okay to say something now?
Go ahead.
I should've danced with you.
Okay. Good-bye.
Were you asleep?
What job?
Were you asleep?
I wasn't asleep!!
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
I had to see you...
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
Yes. I really would.
Uh-huh...
Why? What have you been thinking about?
Good night.
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
Stop staring. Do a vase.
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
But what about...
One night with me!
I love you...  Let him take you home.
What the heck are those for?
What are you trying to do to me?
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
You changed the room around...
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
Hey -- you called me... I...
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
Good evening.
Actually, I don't think so.
Shall I get her for you?
No. Please, don't force him.
Just move on. No one here killed him.
Oh, is he dead?
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
Yeeeess!!!
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
Did you... do something to him?
That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.
It smells like shit in here?
Go away.
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Please, just leave.
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
I carry bacon in my pocket.
Oh, my gosh.
Come on, sweetheart...
Would you leave now, please?
That's very thoughtful.
You consider your life easy.
Another place where?
I think you gotta camp it here...
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
Picking on me won't help.
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
But you know where you're lucky?
What's wrong?
How do you write women so well?
Wait -- I want to see the painting.
Is there a problem?
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a waiter.
Where?
What?
What restaurant?
Uh, Fontella's
What is this?
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
What are you doing?
You're right.  Talking too much again.
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
What?  You think I'm running you up?
Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.
No fucking way.
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
Bain.  Michael Bain.
How long have you been freelance?
So what happens now?
We go around once.
Okay.
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
Five million dollars?
Game over, bitch!
I'm on the scent.
Such language in front of a lady.
How in the fuck do you know that?
No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.
Where have you been, Robert?
Sick.  The flu.
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.
What?
How did he know?
I don't know what the fuck you are.
Hello, Robert.
The contract?
I know what happened.
I bet you fucking know!
Is this how it went, Nick?
Um, five.
Get on the expressway.
Nikita?  She helped me find you.
What?  How did you know I had a cat?
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
I work for the government.
Bullshit.
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
Ten million --
Now what?
Okay.  How did you find me?
'Them'?
An assassin?
Until a minute ago.
Who is that other guy?
Another contractor.
So this is something between you and him?
Because he is trying to retire me.
He wants to kill you?
Yes.
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
Yes.
Forget it!
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
Listen -- I don't even know your name.
Rath.  Robert Rath.
Electra.
Just Electra?
Yeah.
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
No.
Why?
With computers.
It's not the same, is it?
I killed him.
The C.I.A.?
More or less.
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
You were like a boy genius?
Why not?
I was just different.
But you knew what they were training you for?
Women?  No... not really.
Why?
Tell me about the first time.
My first take?
Yes.
Why?
Are they usually like that?
No.  Just the first one.
After that?
They become complicated... messy.
Did it ever bother you?
Did it ever bother James Bond?
You said you didn't trust it.
Do you have a passport?
Several.
Good.
Where is it?
Hey, where are you?
Thinking.
About?
I don't know.
That's where he'll be.
No.
Oh.  What do you think about?
No.
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
Do you think he's here?
Here?
In Costa Blanca.
What do you think he's doing?
Okay.
You should knock.
Sorry.
How was the beach?
Where did you learn it?
Two way?
They saw you coming a mile away.  If I had known we'd be using --
Okay.  Then what?
Sounds pretty well figured out.
Except --
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
For Nicholai?
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
Yes.
Ten years later, here you are again.
Do you have ulcers?
I think I got one today.
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
Did you think they were newlyweds?
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
How do you know they're not?
Jesus, if someone had --
No.
And you were drilling these holes...?
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
What are you doing?
What?
That's a ridiculous move.
Why?
Can I ask you something?
I'm sure you will.
Yes.
Are you attracted to me?
Yes.
Why?
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
Attraction is a complication?
It can be.
Yes.
Who was she?
What happened to her?
She was taken.
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
Is this becoming complicated?
No.
When did it start?
Honestly?
Why?
That doesn't sound normal.
Martin.
Four minutes.
What?
I waited another four minutes.
Right.
I'm taking off my mike.
Okay.
Electra --
What?
Was nice.
He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!
Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
Hi.  Did you call --
I prefer it like this.
Would you like a drink?
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
For what?
Do you ever regret things you've done?
Do you ever think about starting over?
All the time.
Then, I'll sail alone.
Is that all you want?
Thank you.
I think I've heard of you.
It's possible.
You're pretty famous aren't you?
Average.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
Can I ask you something?
Go ahead.
Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.
Anything.
Why didn't you fade?
You mean quit?
That's correct.
How would you like the funds?
American currency.
This will take some time.
Of course, senor.
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.
What are you having?
A coke, if they have it?
He_s the closest we've got to an intellectual.
Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
You guys having a go a me or what?
We're only joking.....It is your round though!
No, just crap. I want some picture frames.
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!
What did the beer cost?
Oh yeah, what's that?
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.
He's not drunk, he's crazy.
He was an electrician?
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel!
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
Tell them we're working for the University.
Thought of everything haven't you.
Yep, except a name for this place.
No, why?
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
No....The Asylum!
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
Can you do the lock on it?
It must be on the other side of this.
I'd love to get in there.
Don't we have enough already?
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
Need any disks?
Destroy the evidence huh.
Have you ever stolen anything?
Like helping a sick kid?
No, for the Asylum.
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
It looks new, they might miss one or two.
We're going to need it all.
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
So why didn't we?
Afternoon!
No, not if you've got better things to do.
Like a hand?
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
Red or white?
Have you cleared all the rubble up?
Get me a couple of beers and a salami.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
My God! What happened?
I fell in love.
And a tram hit you?
No, the boyfriend.
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
She's cool.
A fine specimen for conversion.
Don't tell me you really are in love?
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
Shit no, it'll be twice cost.
Does Jahn's thing have a name?
Tell me some bad news?
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
So I hear.
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
Now you're using that word.
Did you see anything in the files?
And if you're wrong.
Yeah, Dave Walters.
God, I think I need a holiday.
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
No!
You're sure?
Do you know the way?
No, by road?
Yeah, pretty well.
Take this exit.
That one?
Jesus Holly, we got enough time.
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
It's that one isn't it.
There shooting at something.
Doug?
So am I.
Before you go, did you get those bruises here?
Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
I've been around.
Sure. Excellent.
I'd like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here....A weekly thing.
Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
I could pencil you in if you like?
Turned Czech huh?
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?
What? You are crazy!
I don't want to get in trouble.
Let's walk over the bridge, we haven't done that for a while.
Kat, I'm in paradise. I don't ever want to leave.
So, we won't be going to London?
I hope you're going to invite me in?
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
No way Doug, I can't.
Beer please! Do you want another drink?
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
No, I love you, really.
Will it help to get you out?
I don't understand, it's your home?
No, it's not true, you're lying.
Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through here?
Sure, I've done it easily.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
Yep, it's all yours.
Great....How long will it go for?
About forty minutes.
Okay?
It is okay........We will paint the wood black, yes?
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
What for?
Will this thing take long?
No, it should be over soon.
I thought I'd help out.
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
A champion of lost causes huh?
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
We_re not all running away
Is it dry?
What would you like, beer?
No, just a coffee.
I'd better get you to a hospital.
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
I had it coming from someone.
Don't you have a girlfriend?
Uh-huh!
Run into Josh?
Better than you.
Hmm, I still owe him.
Where did you steal the car?
This is your doing?
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
And you broke into that room?
That's right.
You will wish you hadn't.
Why did you break into that particular building?
It was the biggest I could find.
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
Enjoying our hospitality?
I'll need to make a phone call.
Yeah!
Hey Doug, where you been?
No, just a drill.
And a fifty foot extension lead?
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
But I have to finish this....
I decided to help out at the Asylum.
Josh!
I don't want to go.
That's my bag.
Go to hell!
It's more than what you're worth.
Shall I look after the rest?
Honey what a pleasant surprise, sorry to keep you waiting.
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
Will you come home and forget all about him?
Why are there still such headlines?
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
You are responsible...What has happened?
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
So, who is in the building?
All the more reason to eliminate him.
So go dance.
With you.
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
She asleep?
Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --
And I have no idea why.
What if they expel you?
Kelly wouldn't do that.
Why not?
'Bout what?
Your father dropped off an extra check.
I don't want his money.
Out with Belinda?
You look nice. I should have dressed.
You're fine like that, Mom.
To see your father?
A late night or an early morning?
Late night.  You?
Were you with Jamie?
Yeah.
I could take after Dad, too.
You do. You're handsome and charming.
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
He wants to talk to you.
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.
Hypotheticals --
Don't call him a dipshit.
Deranged.
And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan.
Landon!
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
You.
He goes to my father's church. He could've died --
-- This your idea of small talk?
I don't make small talk --
Were?
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
Can't you have a normal conversation?
'I hope your dreams come true.'
'Is it really me?'
You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
I know you don't want help.
Yeah.
Like me.
What the -- ?!
What's with the friggin numbers?
I'll take a chance.
It's private.
I know. Don't say anything.
You think so.
The world of the dead?
What is that?
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
You're really into God, right?
My relationship with God is my own.
You have to believe to have faith.
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
He doesn't trust you.
The play's going to be really good.
Oh. Just not at school...
Or anywhere where people might see us.
Belinda's a very jealous person.
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
He okay?
You were great the other night.
I haven't been nice to you.
People can see.
Maybe you inspire me.
All of it.
It's not.
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
I don't want to be just your friend --
So you're talking to me?
What does that mean?!
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
Like fire.
Why not?
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
Is there a rush?
Your turn.
No.
Before we do this.
Stand right here.
We can measure wind.
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
What do you actually know with religion?
I don't understand...
I might do it wrong.
You make me feel...
Loved?
Assholes. This happen to you?
Come on.
Where?
What would you do up here?
What'd you tell your father?
When did you build this?
Mars.
You planned this --
Are you trying to seduce me?
Can you locate XXI5639I?
From citizen high to citizen low.
That what you do?
One of your secrets.
You're worried about your college applications.
No.
What are you going to -- ?
Pull over.
Jamie --
I'm so sorry. I'm a coward --
Help me live until I die?
Nope.
Anything you want.
Slim Jim? Apple? Yogurt? You like yogurt.
What are you thinking?
I've talked to your father.
You know how to waltz??
How you doing?
How're you doing?
Can I -- go out?
Will you do something for me?
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
The Carter boy. Tell me about him.
I'm supposed to always be alone?
I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.
What's Landon Carter up to?
It was a play.
Boys like him have -- expectations.
No. I want what's best for you.
No you didn't.  But he did change. Just not enough.
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
You're in the play?
I care for her.
This week.
So talk to us about something.
Like what, sir?
We didn't tell him any different for years --
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
Materially or spiritually?
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
Landon. You go on home.
I'm not tired.
You have materials for the side bearings?
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
You know about this stuff?
I helped Jamie with the first one.
You've been well?
Yes. You?
You're marrying again.
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
I'm no dummy.
Now I can do what I want.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
I'd do that --
I'd work backstage or something?
When do I get time for me?
No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
Where did you get -- ?
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
Thank you.
So what did we just make?
Scalene?
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
What do you want, Biff?
This... is the number one single?
This is 1952....?
Morning Dick.
Marty. What's for breakfast?
Hot tip,  Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
What's N.R.C.?
How was school today?
Fine.
Learn anything?
Oh yeah.
You mean you're going to stay up all night?
How old are you?
Here's your jacket!
Hi, Marty.
What time does school start around here?
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
But he didn't ask me.
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
Uh, hi, Eileen.
Dad, you seen the drill?
Fine..
Learn anything?
The sunrise? What for?
Well... yeah...
What is that? A pencil that writes in ink?
'Bike fine point?'
I don't want to hit you in the stomach!
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
I'm going to be at the dance.
And where am I gonna be?
Why?
Maybe if I used my left....
You'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?
Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
You have a name?
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
I'm sorry, there's no answer.
Operator, what's today's date?
March 11th.
What year?
Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
Eight thirty.
AM or PM?
Pro, the sun's out!
Catch you later! 
Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!
Marty, that would alter history.
Professor? Professor Brown?
You answered the door!
An atomic bomb.
Say, where did this guitar come from?
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
Well, it was there.
I know.
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
There's no way of knowing.
What do you call this? 
What theater was I at?
Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.
What? 
I run this place! 
Suzy!
What did you do to your hair?
Hi. where's Cato?
Well, he's gone.
Gone?... Where?
He said not to tell.
What's going on?
Okay.
Catch!
How you doing, Cato?
Where'd you get them antlers?
Yeah, I guess.
That's what he told you, huh?
I'll catch up with you.
Yeah.
What do you feed him?
Does he bite?
I used to throw trash for the City.
You lost that one?
Mmmmm.
You like people?
They're okay.
Well, Kit...
Tom...
Good luck to you.
Thanks.
Sure is pretty.
What'd you come out here for?
Is that right?
Hi.
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
No, you're not either.
Yeah? Why not?
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
Okay.
Jack.
You love him?
Yeah. I can imagine.
Nah, I got me a job.
What?
Can I be honest?
He'll say that?
Nothing.
Hi.
Well, stop the world.
You want to go for a ride?
Well, I got homework.
You're a redhead.
I know.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Why not?
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
Somebody else is going to get it.
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
You know what I think?
But it would hurt.
I came in the front.
How bad off is he?
Are you sure?
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
How you doing?
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
How's he doing?
Think I got 'em?
What'd you put him in there for?
You tired?
I don't want a steak.
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?
No.
Positive?
I'd like to get out of here.
Everybody loves trout.
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
You smoke Pall Mall?
Have you got a better idea?
Hi.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Yes?
Hi, whatcha doing?
You're my friend, aren't you?
Yes.
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
You didn't walk out here.
Okay, friend. Start running.
Just gimme a chance.
Hi.
Think I'll take the juice?
You tossed my hat out the window.
Wanta sue me?
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
There's another one we owe 'em.
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
I'm starving...somebody, help.
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
Then what?
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
You're a welcome sight...
Apache?
We will, old fried, we will.
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
Not really.  This is pretty important.
Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
Let her out. In my custody.
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
Buckaroo--! Sorry--
Dead.  Damnit!
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
What is this thing?  A fighter?
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!
And they got Penny!  Look!
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
Raise your hand...where?
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
Go away.  Let me rot?
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
You.  Like the papers all say.
Was she pretty?
The girl I remind you of.
I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
You keep an eye on it.
She was killed, Penny.
How did she die?  I wanna know.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
Believe in Penny Priddy?
Stay here, I'll be back.
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.
What? A black ship?  Where?  A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
John Whorfin will kill us!
But John Whorfin said kill her.
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
Pick those up, Reno.
It's a spittin' image.
Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.
Any sign of Buckaroo?
So where's Buckaroo?
Is, uh... Is he okay?
I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
How about you? Will you be alright?
I see.
...I know this must look... funny.
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his 
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
...Who is this?
If you could, I'd 
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
Yes, I'm afraid I have.
Well... THIS.
You wrote his scripts for him?
Before what?
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
Barton!
I want to know!
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
How d'ya like your room!
...Who is this?
Chet!
...Hello.
I write.
No, I  I didn't mean to sound 
How long you been up there, Fink?
Yeah, he's funny that way.
...No. I never saw him with anyone else.
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
Well that's what he said.
I beg your pardon?
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?
It's still a little early for me.
Ever act?
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
Think about it, Fink. Writers come and go; we always need Indians.
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started
I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
He's a great writer 
To do what?
...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
...That's fine.
...Barton, is everything okay?
Sound a little what?
Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work 
Can be. Not easy, but 
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
What kind of scribbler are you  newspaperman did you say?
...I don't guess this means much to you.
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself.
Howdy, neighbor.
Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me?  Can't trade my head in for a new one.
My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.
...This must be boring you.
...Yeah, okay.
I hope these are your shoes.
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
And there's hope for you too, Charlie. Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen policies.
...Your room does that too?
What do you mean?
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
...Can I come in?
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
Are you sure 
Barton. Are you all right?
No... Can I come in?
Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out.
...Will you stay with me till they get here?
...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this?  What're we gonna do?
Hold on 
I didn't do this, I did NOT do this
I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
We gotta call the police 
Yeah.
But I didn't do it  don't you believe me?
Jesus... They can tell that...
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
But Charlie  why me? Why 
...Yes, thank you.
...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
I  Mr. Lipnik 
Mr. Lipnik, I 
Fink.
Mr. Lipnik.
Excuse me?
...Okay
Okey-dokey, go ahead.
...Those your only bags?
L.A.P.D.
Is this multiple choice?
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
Got a couple questions to ask ya.
You want my partner to kiss your ass?
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
All of which he's now missin'.
Well, some of his throat was there.
Physician, heal thyself.
Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
...I thought you said you were a writer.
Second one of your friends to end up dead.
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
He teach you to do it?
Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr.  Lipnik.
Where were you tonight?
All night?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was drinking.
When did you start drinking again?
I want you in Dr. Gardner's office at nine o'clock.  You're out of control, Curran.
Take care, you hear?
Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it?
So -- how are things?
How about the coke?
No.
Yes.
You okay?
Yeah.
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
Who?
We were in some of the same classes.
I need a cigarette.
What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?
It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?
Who?
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
What do you want, Nick?
She told you, didn't she?
Did you know Noah Goldstein?
I had him in two classes.
You should do something about this lock.
What are you doing here?
I'm De...
How long were you having sex with him?
About a year and a half.
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
Do you have a cigarette?
I don't smoke.
Yes, you do.
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
I told you -- I quit.
What's your new book about?
How did you feel when he died?
But you didn't hurt --
No.
Because you didn't love him --
Sure.
I passed.
How do you know all this stuff about me?
You know all about me.
Am I... disturbing you?
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
You tell me.
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
She wiped out her whole family.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
I like you.
Don't get too cocky.
Why not?
You can make a mistake.
Fine.
Ice?
What did you pay Nilsen?
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
What if I call you Nicky?
My wife used to call me that.
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?"
Aren't you going to thank me?
Why does he do it?
I'll risk it.
How's your new book?
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
Did you think it was so special?
What did you think?
How about Roxy?  Is she a fuck to the century, too?
Fine.  How's your back?
Are you kidding?  You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
You shouldn't play this game.
You're in over your head.
Did you like her to watch?
It's OK.  It's OK.
I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
No.
You won't believe me.
Do you believe me?
I don't know.
You're not going to tell me what she's doing.  I thought we weren't playing games anymore.
No.
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
Did you miss me?
I have to do some research tomorrow.
No thanks.
What are you researching?
I'm writing a book.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
It won't sell.
Why not?
I finished my book.
How did it end?
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.
Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
How did he die?
I don't really feel like talking anymore.
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
You have the right to an attorney.
You workin' on another book?
It teaches you to lie.
What kind of drugs?
What was the weapon?
.38 revolver.  Never recovered.
Were there ever any suspects?
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
Do you remember his name?
Nilsen?
Was she ever a suspect?
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
What kind of talk?
The usual -- a girlfriend.
I hope I helped you out.
Who was this fuckin' guy?
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
How'd it go, son?
What's goin' down, son?
I got tired of being played with.
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
What is it you got between you?
I don't know.
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
Everybody that she plays with dies.
Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.
I went over last night, too.
You... fucked her!  Goddamn dumb sonofabitch... You fucked her! Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch --
I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS!
You don't like punk rockers?
You feeling better?
I'm not afraid of her.
Why the hell not?
Catherine says you don't like her.
I don't believe it.
Why not?
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
Where the hell you goin'?
Maybe the maid did it.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
You look like dogshit.
Homicide.
Were you with him last night?
Are you kidding me?
So what do we do -- nothing?
What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
Fuck you, Phil.
She killed him.
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
Why do you think he's dead?
Who are you?
Anderson.  Jack W. Donald M.  I'm sorry.  No Lisa.
Did you check all four years?
Yes I did.
Can there be some mistake?
No. Should I have?
Hey  it's the big A.M..
Is this finished yet?
I don't know.
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
Naa..
Of what?
Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
Saddle River, New York!
It's in New Jersey.
New York.
I think it's in New Jersey.
It's in New York.
Ignorant art?
Yeah... Like  stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
Ouch..
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
That was my favorite part!
Who is it?
Annina Nosei.
Is Jean Michel here?
These are great.
Aren't they?
How much for these five?
I'm interested in showing Jean's work.
No.
When?
Tom and Cynthia Kruger.
Jean, your parents are here.
Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!
Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.
That's the same guy who did this painting.
I didn't see you.
Yes. What do they... stand for?
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
Yes, but as a black painter 
What?
I'm not black.
Not what?
Not black.
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
Who said that?
Yeah.
Paint it out.
It's Andy again.
Still not here.
 In this corner?
You want me to put it here?
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve  I mean Shenge.
Blue? Where?
Who am I?
You're shattering all my myths.
About what?
Your people.
Check you later, man.
Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!!
We got beat.
You gonna carry that around all night?
What's the rush, John Henry?
I ain't John Henry.
Good.
I don't really have any problems.
I guess it was a long time ago.
Sit down! You're gonna fall out!
I guess you did.
Guess I just got sick of him.
Can I walk you home?
You do! You definitely do.
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
Party girls? Can I call you?
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
... I'll buy you some new ones.
Do you know what he's saying?
You're back.
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
I'm your family.
Basquiat, don't lie.  This is smack.
I hadn't thought about it.
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee 
It looks done.
... babies.
What's wrong with me?
Hi.
So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.
How is he?
What's that about?
I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
Is that the best quality you have?
Yeah, it's the best one.
I'll take the whole tin.
I really... admire you.
Would you check out my studio some time?
What's your name, man?
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
Hi.
You like your dad's paintings?
Some of them.
See you later.
How can I ever thank you?
Come on.
Wanna Mac?
No, I'd like the scarf.
Have a Mac.
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
So what?
So shut up and keep painting..
What time is it?
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
I'll make you another one.
'Phillips head,' right?
You don't have any!!!
OK! Goodbye!
I just don't think you're being fair.
I need this?
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
It's cold.
It's vichyssoise, sir.
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
I guess this mean we won.
Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
How could you?  I'm a woman...
A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
First you're gonna shut up.  Then you're gonna turn yourself in.
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
We've met.
Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
Didn't I say that?
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
Well that's a ... long story ...
I'm listed.
Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
Nope, I told her everything.
"Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
Photojournalist.
I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
Nor I, on the second.
Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --
Y'mean take off our costumes?
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
No.  No glass on the inside.
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
It does to me.
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Y'mean frame him?
Let's consummate our fiendish union!
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
Son!
She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
Ten, nine...
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
... eight, seven...
Silent night, violent night...
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
No, just give you a splitting headache.
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
And a very, very good one.
Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
You certainly will not.
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
I'm sorry.  I was too late.
Uncle Alfred?
In spirit only, I'm afraid.
He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
I must have dozed off.  My sincerest apologies, sir.
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
But I can't can I?
It's good to see you.
Women.
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
I'm on break from-
Sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.
Please be looking for me.
I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.
Youwsa!  Nothing but air.
This is easy.
Crimefighter's rule number two.
I'm afraid to ask.
What exactly are you doing?
After you have frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.
Nice suit.  And today you are?
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
Watch the first step.
You think Freeze will take the bait?
You don't have two million.  Three million - -
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
Umm-hmmmm.
No beauty...
We gotta get those locks changed.
She knows who we are.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
No sign of the snowman.
If we could relay the sunlight-
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
You're not even listening to me.
Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
Who's Ivy?
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
What happened to his wife?
I need the Wayne Diamonds.
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
I got the diamond.  Quell problemo, Bruce?
Of course.  Alfred still keeps your mother's picture in his room.
He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
Like hell you do.
She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
Make yourself right at home.
You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
How about dangerous curves?
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
I've got to stop him.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
The dreams again, sir?
I think they're getting worse.
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
Scholarly research?
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
No. You said I. I killed them.
Is he all right?
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
He ran away?
Actually, he took the car.
He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
The _Rolls_?
Maybe they're right.
Why do I keep doing this?
Perhaps the fall...
What?
...A bat.
Master, Bruce?
All the answers are numbers.
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
What do maniacs always want?
Letters in the alphabet.
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
How about, MR. E.
Mystery.
And another name for Mystery?
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
How ya doin', Al?
Al?
Up here, Al.
Just checking, young sir.
He's home. I sent the signal.
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
Now black rubber.
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
I haven't had much luck with women...
Help Chase. I'll be back.
Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
Wait. I have a riddle for you.
Mr...?
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
Wait. You can't go.
So glad you could come.
Nostrovia.
La'chiem.
Rinka.
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
What do you know about obsession?
That's usually my line.
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
Excuse me.
I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.
Like normal folks.
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
But...
Well, I met someone...
He sure did.
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
Why do you do that?
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking.
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
I don't want to remember!
I don't-.
What are you talking about?
Okay. I'm outta here.
Edward...
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Can't tell if you don't say please.
I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...
I'll show you it works.
I got family. ...Please.
Please. I swear I won't say noth-
Wait! You said you'd let me go!
Where are you sending Batboy this time?
About what?
Go ahead. You can say it.
A-14.
A hit.
How high up would you say that is?
Yes?
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
Where's the boy?
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
Look! Police!
I know. I called them.
What about the girl?
Can't we --
How much do you weigh?
...Not even a 'thank you'?
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
How do I know you won't keep them all?
Thank you, Vicki.
... How long have I been out?
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
What is this stuff? Kevlar?
Better. It's not on the market yet.
It doesn't protect your head, though.
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host.  Alexander Knox.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
Do you want a drink?
As far as I know.
What did you see?
There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
Maybe we should just kiss.
All street mimes should be executed.
I know it's late. I -- Are you there?
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."
Keep her on the line!
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
Got it!
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
We got 'em!
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
WHAT?
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
MOVE! Can't you do something??
I missed you, Lieutenant.
I'm on top of it.  If there's a problem --
I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
Let's beat it, man.  I don't like it up here.
What are you, scared of heights?
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta --
Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
I've considered that possibility.
That's it?
You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Man, I feel like Robin Leach.  You actually know all these people?
Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
What were you thinking?
Nice snap, huh?  Pulitzer Prize, 1963.
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
Allie, he's not.
Not what?
Scottish.
Ali?  What's wrong?
Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...
Hi,
Sort of half.....
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.
Here, let me do that.
Two dollars please.
Annie, it's me.
Right first time.
Goodnight Annie.
Ah, Mr Bean ...
Better go.  Grierson hates people being late.
Ahm.....
oh dear.
What happened?!!!
Howls he getting on with the family?
He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.
Say that again, son.
No!
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?
Of course.
And a car.
Maybe two cars.
Welsh.
Honey, calm down now... it's okay...
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
You arrange those flowers yourself?
Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.
But is she gonna be okay?
Doctor Jacobson?
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
It is urgent, sir.
Interesting suit.
Why thank you sir.
Nope.
Of course he is.
Dammit, Beavis, I was about to score. Huh huh.
What's gone?
What?
This sucks.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
No it wasn't!
Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't know Anderson had a Camper.
Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
What's your problem Beavis?
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
Wait, I wanted her to do it.
Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
Beavis. This is what it's all about.
Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
Huh huh huh. That chick was talking about doing it.
Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.
Me first!
Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
Me first.
No way butt-hole! I want the window.
Heh heh. We're in Washington!
Damn, huh huh.
So, like, where is she?
This is dumb, let's find that chick.
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Uh... Is this the right bus?
Check it out Butt-Head, porta-potties.
Hey, where'd those chicks go?
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Uh...
Hey Butt-Head, look. A jack. Heh heh.
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
You hear that, Beavis! We're gonna get alcohol, tobacco and guns!
Uh... bye-bye.
Shut up, dill-hole.
Butt-dumpling...
Turd-burglar...
Dill-wad...
Bunghole...
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
Uh... dill, um, face...
Um... ass... head...

You already said that, Butt-Head.
Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
Really? I poop too much.
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
They perk me right up.
Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Uh, we didn't score yet.
Does that say Xanax?
Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
...Two...
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
You see what I see, Bork?
Cavity search...?
Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.
Not on him, Chief.
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
Where are his pants?
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
Whoa, this kicks ass! Huh huh huh.
Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I scored with both of them...
No, Jane.
You'll be rich!
Manchurian Tung oil?  Where did you get it?
Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you.
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
Oh no.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
Wave at the lion.
How's your arm?
You'd better sit down, hon.
Two hours.
Handbook for the recently diseased.
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
I don't think we survived the crash.
God, it's Jane Butterfield!
What's she doing here?
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.
Oh, honey, we may need that.
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
<u>You</u> left me.
That's it?  No number, or instructions?
That little girl saw us.
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.
God, this is so corny.  Have we been reduced to this?  Sheets?
Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
Where are your skulls and bones?
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
Of course I did.
Here's something.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
What happened?
Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
I guess we open it.
She's only fourteen...
Honey.  Let's go.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
Let's see if she can get my model back.
What...?
What time is it?
3:30 I guess.
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
We were trying to scare your mother.
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
What is going on?
We studied all day yesterday. Don't tell me...
You don't have an appointment, do you?
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
<u>Barbara</u>?!!
Are you available?
All right.  Who are you?
We're...
We're very unhappy.
-- Like you used to be?
No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.
Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
Where'd they go?
I want to get in.
You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
Yes.
Three syllables.
I don't know what that signal means.
Beetle!
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?
God, you're anatomically correct!
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
So... You're ready for me now?
You've got to help them.
Can you help <u>me</u>?
W... What is it?

Your qu...?  But you're...
I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
Otho'll know what to do.
What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
Just don't tell Lydia.
Why not?
They're probably guilty about what they did to me.
What do you think, honey?
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
Where is your mother?
What?
Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
Dad.  Do you believe me?
Stepmother's...
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
The attic room is locked --
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
I cannot believe this.
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
Don't you <u>dare</u>.
I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
What do you think?
Viridian?
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
You don't have a key?
Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
Are they still here, Otho?
What's happening to them?
Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?
Hellooo!  How's school?
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
Otho, that's terrible.
They don't want to come down.
Their wedding clothes.
The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
I understand. I've seen it done before.
You were wrong, it did hurt.
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
An attorney?
Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
... And please call me Robert.
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
I would like to walk today.
Will you be leaving now, Robert?
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
Yes. I love Eve very much.
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
No more, Robert... No more needles...
Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
... Do you think we should look for him?
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Do you know Raphael?
No sir, I don't believe I do.
I hope you're comfortable.
Yes. He's a very careful driver.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
Would you care for a drink?
I would like to watch television.
May I ask your name?
My name is Chance.
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
Did you lose something?
No. It won't do that.
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
... Good night, Chauncey.
Chauncey!
Hello, Eve.
Your leg must be getting better.
What is that?
Our greenhouse.
Oh, I like that very much.
Chauncey...
Thank you, Eve.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
... Good night, Chauncey.
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
I like the President. He is a very nice man.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
To watch...? To watch me...?
Yes. I like to watch.
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
Chauncey! Chauncey!
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Yes. It's a very good show.
Can you see well?
Yes, very well, thank you.
Do you like it?
Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
... Are you sure you like it?
Yes, I do, it's very good.
I don't want Robert.
I see.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
Oh, good.
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
Yes, Eve. That would be good.
Yes. I am very hungry.
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
Well, that's good news, my boy.
He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
I want to tell Eve.
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
... Sir?
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
What about money?
Some pictures...?
Yes. Of men and women.
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
Good day, Mr. Chance.
This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...
Let's have a look, do you mind?
Please, sir.
... Yes. You can take me.
How long do we stay in here?
... Hmmm... Elevator.
Good morning, Louise.
Well, ain't that the truth...
Yes. I was there with Ben.
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
How were you paid?
Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
Have you served in the Army?
Those trees were very young when I first arrived.
... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?
What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?
I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
But you won't sign, correct?
Good morning, Mr. President.
Try again.
Sid, it's useless!
Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
... Yes, I am, Ben.
Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
And look who you brought with!
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling.
No, that won't do any good.
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
I can certainly understand that...
It's that gardener!
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
Good night.
Yes? What have you found?
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
This is not what I requested.
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
Yes, I did.
It's that serious, huh?
Take care of yourself, Ben.
You take care too, Bobby.
Yeah.
The one where you're that jewel thief.
Who am I thinking of?
Hello, I'm here about the ad.
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Which one is Elijah again?
The monkey.
Why'd you do it, Craig?
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
Yeah, just an idea I had.
She's very beautiful.
Hi.
I was worried.
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
The ferret?
The iguana.
Yeah. You want a beer?
I want to try.
I'll meet you on the turnpike.
I have to go back.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
I have to go back now.
Why?
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
What are you doing?
You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
No they're not.
You've always hated the animals.
What's that?
What about Maxine?
Fuck Maxine.
Yes.
And he was with her.
We?
Me and John.
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
Suck my dick!
Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
It'll never happen, fuckface.
What's that?
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
It's Elijah.
The iguana?
A better friend.
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Simulates?
Sure, after a fashion.
So how was it?
That... was... no... simulation.
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
Schwartz.
Pardon?
My name is Schwartz.
Mr. Juarez?
Yes?
Yex?
Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid Im in love with somebody else.
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
Dr. Lester...
No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
Is that true?
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
Emily Dickinson.
Who told you?
I'm right?
Just.
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
You married?
What'll you have?
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
You're a fag or a liar.
Yikes.
This is important!
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Tickets to Malkovich?
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
You're late.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
Lotte? Is that you?
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
Hello, Don.
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
No. Don't be an ass.
Can I be anyone I want?
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
But I think I have another plan.
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Forget it.
Thank you, Floris.
Think, Jew florist?
Do you dream often?
Says who?
Says me. Do you dream often?
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
Do we get to wear a crown?
But of course.
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
Oh, be still my heart.
I'm getting divorced.
No you mustn't, my child.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
No, I didn't know that.
No.
No! Don't harm the vessel!
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
I love you, Lotte.
We have to meet.
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
Did you see the reviews?
She's not available.
What's the play?
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
Great then.
Yeah?
Mr. Malkovich?
Can I get you a drink?
Thanks so much for coming over.
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
Do you mind?
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
Come on in.
Lotte called me.
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
You mean with Malkovich?
I'd love to see your work.
That was incredible. You're brilliant!
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
Vegas.
Bad dream, darling?
I've got to leave Malkovich.
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
Yeah what?!
Good-bye, Maxine.
Captain Mertin?
There ain't.
Folks came.
Folks come. Folks go.
I got a delivery around here. Name of Tucker.
Well?
The Word. What you was put here to speak.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
You saying nothing counts?
You punishing Him, ain't you?
Not like He punished me.
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
Was a time I knew what was.
We have to be steady. "These things too will pass". What you looking for? A miracle?
They'll be all right. I'm surprised they lasted here this long.
Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
YOU HURT ME.
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
What do you know about it? I sleep where I want.
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YES.
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
You don't sit with me!!
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
I want somethin' sweet.
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
Don't pay to complain.
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
That girl...You know, Beloved...
Yes?
Well, if you want my opinion...
I don't. I have my own.
You grown.
Yes sir
Well, good luck with the job.
Yes?
May I come in?
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
Oh.
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
Fine. But what would I do at night?
Be here. In case.
I want to work, Miss Lady.
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
No. I mean work work.
Could be that fall you took.
Should I wake her?
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
Morning.
But mama..
Mama let me help you.
No...no...no..
Out where?
Was over to Baby Suggs.
I know Denver.
You sure?
I know what I see.
True.
Better ask Paul D.
Can't locate him.
He's sleeping in the church.
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
He ask, I give him anything.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
I don't know him that well.
It's her, ain't it?
You was friends.
Till she showed herself.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
What run him off? Tell me that!
I run him off.
He knew Baby Suggs?
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
You planning to do anything about it?
You remember your price, Stamp?
Jesus.
It ain't what you think.
Leave off..
Who is she? Where she come from?
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
All he can. All he can.
Sethe?
You shaved.
Yeah. Look bad?
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
You got to get up from here, girl.
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
What, baby?
What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late?
Make it the way I always do.
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Sure Allan, I'll be there.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Fuck.
What do you think?
Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie Treehorn wants to see you.
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
Uh-huh.
Her life is in your hands.
I know my rights.
I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I want Bill Kunstler.
Hey, man, I'm not--
The Gundersons.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Fuck, man!  That's terrible!
Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
Come and get it.
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!
Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.
NUSSING!
Excuse me?
Yeah.
What's this?
That is for the urn.
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
They range up to three thousand.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
Sheesh.
Where you going, Dude?
I'm going home, Donny.
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
Almost five!
What tied the room together, Dude?
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
Yeah Walter, what's your point?
What's a pederast, Walter?
I am the Walrus.
Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!
What the fuck is he talking about?
They posted the next round of the tournament--
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
It's already posted.
I'm shomer shabbas.
Oh yeah, how'd it go?
Who has your undies, Walter?
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
They were Nazis, Dude?
Uh-huh.
Are you gonna split hairs?
No--
Am I wrong?
What have you.  We'll, uh--
Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?
I pull over and kick your ass out, man!
Yes, uh, very impressive.
Please, feel free to inspect them.
Please!  Please!
Nancy's pretty good.
Different mothers, huh?
1972 Pontiac LeBaron.
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
And what do you do, sir?
...Also, my rug was stolen.
No.  Here.
Far from it.
Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
Take it easy, Dude.
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I gotta get back.
Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
What's your drink, Dude?
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!
Hello, gentlemen.  You are the bereaved?
Yeah man.
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
I was talking about my rug.
You're not interested in sex?
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
No it's fine, really, uh--
And please don't call her my mother.
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
From who?
The main guy, Dieter--
Dieter Hauff?
Well--yeah, I guess--
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
Well yeah...I know that.
Delayed after-eff--
Jeffrey.
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
Huh?  He's fucking loaded.
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
Well...no, of course not--
Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
What the fuck are you--
No, but--
Am I wrong!
Yeah, but--
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
State of Israel.  If you will it, Dude, it is no--
Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
You mean--beyond pacifism?
No, you're not wrong--
Well, just take 't easy, man.
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
Anyway.  How much they offer you?
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
Have it your way.  The point is--
It's your roll--
The fucking point is--
What the hell is this?
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
Oh shit.  Walter.
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about that poor woman?  What do we tell--
You don't know, Walter?  You seem to know the answer to everything else!
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
That wasn't her toe.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
They're nihilists.
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Who the fuck is that?
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
Uh-huh.
The bulk of the series.
Not exactly a lightweight.
Is this your homework, Larry?
Look, man, did you--
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
Is the car out front yours?
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
It is a fucking emergency.
Yeah?
Walter, come off it.  You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
What the fuck are you talking about?
Yeah, and you were--
This driveway.
It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
Oh, shit.
He can't walk, Walter!
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.
What's mine is mine.
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
No Dude.
There weren't any shots.
Then what's...
It's a heart attack.
Wha.
Call the medics, Dude.
Walter Sobchak.
Well can we--
We're scattering the fucking ashes!
Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking asshole!
You make everything a fucking travesty!
What about that shit about Vietnam!
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--
Dude here.
Shut the fuck up.  Hello?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Another Caucasian, Gary.
Right, Dude.
Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.
Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
Did I urinate on your rug?
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
Are you employed, sir?
Is this a--what day is this?
Dude.
Huh?
Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!
Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.
Oh, shit.
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
Yeah, but--
I'm not--
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
You happy, you crazy fuck?
Whatta we do about the Mex?
We'll take 'em in the morning.
<i>You'll</i> take him.
He's half yours, partner.
Why?
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
Where to first?
What was that?
I'll heal.
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
Anyone else make it?
Thank you.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
How does it look?
What do you want me to do?
You came back for me.
Did you think I wouldn't?
What do you think?
Sounds like a plan.
I don't like it.
I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
Where were you, Whistler?
Your security's for shit, kid.
Where the hell have you been?
What's your problem, Whistler?
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
What's going on?
He was here.  Watching us.
Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!
Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
From his father, of course.
We're locked in.
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
Any casualties?
An inevitability, I suppose.  Nyssa was not among them, I trust.
Not that I'm in contact with.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Tell me something, Skid --
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
Nope.  Back then we did not.
Going on twenty years now.
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
What about you?  You're not coming?
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
She's been bitten.
You should've killed her, then.
What took you so long?
Beautiful day, isn't it?
You're not going anywhere.
No longer.
Who dies first?
Is something wrong, my friend?
I am tired. Dawn is coming.
But I just got here --
You shouldn't be here.
-- he's a vampire.
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
You used me as bait?!
It worked, didn't it?
But, he could've --
What are you doing?!
You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
There is no cure.
What are you looking at?
What do you see here?
Graffiti --
How can you tell?
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
Like what?
You're hurt --
What am I injecting you with?
It's dark in here.
Just get out of here.
Is he sick?
Any progress?
Some. It's been slow --
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
Are you all right?
I've been better --
How long have we been driving?
It won't work on you.
Get out of here --
I'm not leaving without you.
-- tearing me -- apart.
How's it going, Kam?
You're a week early.
Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
I was afraid that might happen.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
But you -- died --
Deacon brought me back.
How could you be a part of this?
This isn't human blood.
Then what is it?
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
You haven't started in on the internal organs?
That's weird --
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
How do you like that? Right on time.
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
We keep in radio contact.
Whistler!
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
--and if she ever did--
--or incredibly fucking naive.
Why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings--who <u>cares</u>?
I don't...I don't understand them myself.
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
What happened to her, where did she go?
What, are you alright?
Not that I can see.
No.
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??
Please! Please...? I haven't done anything.
Bullshit! Talk!
Domini?
Yes.
What're you doing there?
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
No!
--I'm not staying here!
Let's talk to your husband--
Shit? This is from "Josh's Blair Witch Mix," man!
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
"The Voiiiiices made him do it."
Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
Yeah, so?
--nothing left to play 'em on, honey.
Druid Hill Park.
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
Jesus.
No.
You sure?
That's a sapling--<u>this</u> mother's got to be three hundred years old, minimum.
--do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
You don't want it though.
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
Anna--
What?
You said the name "James."
Baby names?
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
I think we get the gist.
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
--now c'mon!
What can I get you?
Nothing. I dunno--
--you should get back into bed.
Was that you laughing?
Just now?
Just...try and go back to sleep.
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
I can't.
I want to see something!
Are you marked like this??
I know, I know.
Absolutely.
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
The, uh, blur there.
I can't.
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
You want a hand?
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--
How'd you know they were--
I don't know yet.
Hey, <u>chill</u>, man--
Turn the tapes back on.
Does it hurt?
There, what? I didn't see anything.
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
--go!
The witch?
You're a complete fucking idiot, aren't you?
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
I don't believe this.
That's what Josh and Mike said.
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
What movies?
Yeah?
No fucking.
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
We should be so lucky.
What're you, crazy??
--yeah, a hand or something--
--Cotter: shut up.
Get inside quick, they'll stop.
Too busy eating us?
Mi casa y su casa!
Whatta you got, telescopic vision?
Where's Domini?
Fire escape??
She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
Cotter?
Where?
Not the place you want to announce your arrival.
How's she going to know where to--
It's <u>freezing</u>.
What the fuck--??
--I saw what I saw.
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
Be it still alive, James?
I'd strongly advise you to join us--
That's a "j."
Who?
--I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
Hold this.
What?
--Graduate Thesis--
--Cotter--
--a Wiccan--
What're you doing?
This isn't about us.
What?
Okay, but--
They're making "Blair Witch II," too.
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
Let's get inside.
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?
Running a junk yard.
What--
--whatever you want, no problem--
You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?
Just hold on!
What're you nuts--
What?
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
She got <u>paid</u>.
--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.
Oooh. Oooh.
Ah, Domini?
Ripped? They look like they were <u>bit</u> off.
That's almost a year's worth of work!  Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....
Pointless.
What?
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
Women miscarry all the--
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
What'd you see?
Cotter'll kill you.
Still working on it.
Dad...?
Are you alright?
Jesus.
That's why she kills children.
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
What're you afraid's going to happen?
She <u>wasn't</u> a witch.
She's off her fucking rocker--
--I know!
--a <u>lot</u>.
Heather.
Yeah.
Okay. Hypothetically.
Domini's the only logical explanation.
I can't do it!
Gothic rune--the letter "S."
I should check on Anna.
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
She's far from "fine."
No. We <u>all</u> go.
Anna--
"It's why the witch kills children."
Why?
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
--yes--
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
Who <u>is</u> this??
Your mother's pastor.
No, I--
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
...Ray?
What was that?
Where... where you going?
Who was it?
On the phone. Was it for you?
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?
Well... the couch would be all right...
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
You wouldn't be putting me out.
I could've sworn I heard something.
...Well I'll be damned.
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
...Mm-hmm.
When you don't they're usually nice.
...You ever get tired?
Hello?
Abby... you all right?
Ray?... What time is it?
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
...What?
...You called me this morning.
What happened?--Was Meurice there?
...Who?
...What's going on with you two?
...Where is everything?
...You leaving?
...But first I gotta know what happened.
...So?
You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is.
So how long have you know Meurice?
...So what're you doing tonight?
It'll pass.
I own the place.
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
What?
What night is it?
I told you. I like you.
See, I never knew that.
Well now you do.
...You know that car?
No.
...What was that back there?
Sign.
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
Then what'd you come here for?
...You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing.
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
How long did you watch her?
Now that don't make much sense.
...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--
I didn't say that.  Well?
Well what?
What do you think?
Yeah. Is it...
Ya catch any fish?
...What?
Ya catch any fish?
Yeah...
...What kind of fish?
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
Dead, huh?
Of course.
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
...Count it if you want.
Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.
Has Ray come in yet?
How would I know?
What's this?
Red Label.
Right. Sorry.
Pour that back.
What.
Don't throw that out.
What's this?
What.
Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it.
That's not the point.
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
...I thought you were dead. Going home?
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Thanks Meurice.
Tuesday.
Tuesday is ladies' night.
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Jeffrey. you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
Are you Detective Williams?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Come into the study a minute.
Okay.
Anything you can tell me?
The criminals are winning.
What is this? What color is it?
What color is it?
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Is Sandy part of this?
No. not at all.
Who knows you have these?
Only you. and the photo lab.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Hello, baby.
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
Hello, daddy.

Pest control. gotta do your apartment.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.

I wanted to see you.

Well.

Do you like that?
No.
Nothing. Are you alright?
Don?
Thank you. honey.
Yes.
See my nipples?
You can hit me, if you want to.
Do you like me?
Do you know?
You don't?
Hi. can I come in?
Oh shit.
Nice guy.  Who's he?
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Look.
No.
Who is Don?
Don?. Are you in with them?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
No. I should go.
Come in.
It used to make me laugh .but.
Do you like my body?
I'm doing it.
Are you a bad boy?
What do you want?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Does that scare you?
Shut up.
Beeeee careful.
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
I asked first.
I love you Don with all my heart.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
You called me Jeffrey.
I did. are you?
I guess I should go.
I want you to stay with me.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Oh no.
It's okay. it's okay.
They hurt his head.
Who, Dorothy?
Hold me, Don.
Don?. Where is he?
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
No thanks.
No thanks. what does that mean?
Go where?
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Hey? . You like to walk.
What are you lookin' at?
Okay Frank.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
There ya go.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Am I bothering you?
Yes.
How is Central these days?
Terrible. boring.
What else is new?. right?
Yeah. What are you doing now?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
What happened to him?
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Alright.
Are you alright?
So. what's next?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.
That sounds good.
Here's to. an interesting experience.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Oh, okay. can I call?
What's with Mike?
He got a little jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't.
You want a Dairy Queen?
You saw a lot in one night.
. Actually. I've been in twice.
Twice. without her sensing anything?
Yes.
Did you see her undressed?
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Who, me? Why should it?
That's what I thought.
Okay. be careful.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
You better not, Jeffrey.
Okay. okay.
Goodnight.
You were late.
I'm really sorry.
What am I going to do?
Yeah.
You like mysteries that much?
Okay.
What is it?
What was that all about?
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.
It's okay.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
You want to dance?
I can't dance fast.
Let's wait for some slow one.
You want to dance?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Dorothy! ... Dorothy!
Dorothy Vallens?
Probably not. no. Why?
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
I should go with her, Sandy.
Go ahead.
... Sandy?.
Hi Dad.
uh uh.
Are you feeling okay?
Good to see you, son.
How ya doin' Dad?
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
I'm going out for awhile.
Do you want the car?
Can I use the car tonight?
God. you scared me.
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Would you like a piece of cake?
He comes over to study.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
That sounds great!
Sandy? ...Sandy, please.
What are watchin' this junk for?
You can change it if you want to.
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
Greetings, Mr. George.
Where do you guys want to count?
Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.
Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Nothing like this back home.
This is it for me.
You happy, baby?
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Nothing like this back home.
This is it for me.
You happy, baby?
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
Should we buy it?
Are you kidding?
Honey, your nose!
You wanna split?
Yeah, I don't feel so well.
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in front of your parents.
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
Tuna, this is crap.
Tuna, this is crap.
Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
Something about vengance being best served cold.
Not so fast.  I would like to go over the details.
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
What?  Yeah, sure.
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
The coca is my responsibility!
Why are you speaking?
What can I do for you guys?
What the fuck is that?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
What the fuck is that?
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
And I only deal with you?
Nice doing business with you, George.
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.
Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.
You?
For calling you a homo.
Christ almighty, George.  Feed her a cheeseburger or something.  What does she weight, eighty pounds?
No fucking way.
Oh hey, one more thing?
What's that?
Your offense?  Why are you here?
I don't want to talk about it.
Not really, no.
Murder.
What do you got there, Diego?
Nothing.  Just a little project.
What kind of project?
Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
Because I got caught.
No, my brother.
Because they caught me?
Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
What type of planes do you have?
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
Diego Delgado, please?
Allo?
Yeah, I'm out.
Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.
Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
Three million.  I counted it twice.
I'm calling it three.
We're half a million off.
Where do I put this!?
There's no room.
You're a lucky man, Diego.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
Take it easy!  Everything's okay!
Derek Foreal.
You fucked me, Diego.
You went behind my back and you cut me out.
Coke.
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
In how long?  A week?
Surprised to see me?
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
G-d, son.
It's a family heirloom.
I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap.
I want money.
Freedom.
Power?
Yeah, maybe.
Family.
Sure.
Beautiful girls?
Money.
George, you look terrible.
Yeah, well...
Diego?
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
You mad at me?
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
She's angry.  It's all over the news.
You're not going to trial?
No.
Tell Mom, you know...
That was a beautiful message.
How are you doing, George?
What do you guys want?
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
What the fuck?  Is he going to walk?
Figured it out.
George.
Figured it out.
George.
Look what the cat dragged in.
Hello.
Hello.
Do I know you?
I don't think so.
Why are you smiling?
Why are you smiling?
I don't know.  My name is George.
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
She did that before.
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
But this is...
Where are you going?
What are we going to do?!  What are we going to use for money?!
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
Not in front of the kid.
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
Hey, George.  You okay?
Kristina's fine.
Mirtha, how are you doing?
I don't know.
Well, here I am.  See?
Dad.
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
You mean, like a trip?
Where are you going?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
I swear.  On my life.
Swear on my life.
I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.
It's alright, Dad.
I didn't mean to...
I fucked up.
Okay, George.
Because she's visiting me.
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
It's not enough.
Holy shit, Dulli!
No shit, Kevin?
What's the matter, George?  Something wrong?  You look like you just fucked your mother.
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
The strike is a success; but ...
Dien Bien Phu?
In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.
And here?
Sid Ahmed.
Second name.
Which "district" do you belong to?
Second district ...
Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
What "group"?
Third group.
Third group. What's your assignment?
You afraid of these ...?
It's true.
What's happened to you?
What ... What must I decide?
With an unloaded pistol?
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
I don't do that kind of thing.
And how many are we?
Of course. As soon as possible.
Can you read?
Read it.
It's good nobody is following us ...
But it's not even midnight yet!
Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.
Rue de Thbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
A name?
Who is speaking?
How can I give you this statement?
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
Are you ready, colonel?
How you doin' Mister D?
Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.
I've been waiting for you to get back.
You got something on the coke?
Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.
You did a good job, Charlie.
Yeah.
About three hours.
The official cause?
That's what my report will read.
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.
Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
No.
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Like cats and dogs.
Sex.
No -- never.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
No questions.
Objection, Your Honor.
Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
She's innocent.
I've got work to do.
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.
I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
Can I go?
Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
A little after eleven.
Why did you come by?
I had some papers to pick up.
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
Her name?
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
No -- never.
What about Miss Lawson?
How did he look?
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Yes.
Is it Marsh?
Who found him?
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
About a year and half ago.
Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.
We were lovers.
How long were you together?
What kind of condition are you referring to?
What happened next?
I had bypass surgery.
It didn't.
Why not?
Why did she say she was leaving?
She didn't.  She just left.
Why do you think she left you?
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
Yes.
Who was your primary beneficiary?
She was.
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
We stopped seeing each other.
Did you suggest any?
Yes -- Insulin and others.
You'll be sorry?
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
Why does she come to you?
Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
No.
High school?
I heard him say it.
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
Did he make your life miserable?
Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
No.
What about Miss Lawson?
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
He video taped you.
I've been to a few -- yes.
Three fifteen.
A.M -- or P.M.?
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
Hi, Joe.
Yes.
Do you think I did it?
No pain, no gain?
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
Yes.
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
Can we get out of here?
This is your house.
Is it against the law?
What do you think?
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
Oh -- Well, they're different.
That's not an answer.
It's not my taste.
Hi.  It's Frank.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
Sorry.
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
Really?
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
Yes -- it would be nice.
What would?
You and me -- making love.
Is that what you think I was thinking?
There's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, Frank.
She's mistaken.
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?
Alone?
You were brilliant today.
Can I see you later?
Something wrong?
I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
Sugar or honey?
Rebecca -- take these off.
What are you going you doing?
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
I'm dropping the case.
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
Alright, I'll talk to her
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
I love you.
Michael -- get off the phone.
Why?
Because I'm expecting a call.
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
But Your Honor--
Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
The witness will answer the question.
I can back it up.
This is not relaxing.
Really?
If you want me to.
We're supposed to go to the lake.
I know.  What can I do?  He is the boss.
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
She sounds like quite a woman.
Humped
I'll talk to him later.
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
Is that alright, Frank?
Yeah -- what are you doing up?
We have to talk.
Why did you lie to me?
I'm not.
I was thinking that when the trial is over we'd all go skiing for a weekend.
I know.
Please -- not now.
Why didn't you come to me?
It's more involved than that.
Albert's got the stomach flu.
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Yes.
What time did you leave?
Did Marsh use it?
No -- never.
It had to get there somehow.
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
Well, that's a long time.
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
It's a beautiful picture of her.
Well, I can help.
I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
No treasure maps, huh?
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
Mom's orders.
I thought everything WAS arranged.
Well, there's a problem.
Yeah.
Michael.
What?!
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
Don't say that!
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
Bar across the street.
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
I never knew that.
Nobody did.
Oh, yes.
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
They got heat in Michigan.
What do you know about "the changes"?
Roseman Bridge?
Pretty country.
Maybe it's because I live here.
Oh. When did you move back?
After the divorce.
Oh.
How long you been married?
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection.
Want another cigarette?
Francesca.
Lemon?
Mind if I smoke?
Oh. How old?
About a year and a half.
No, your kids.
I doubt that.
He's very... clean.
And clean.
Feeling better?
Is the dizziness gone?
What?
She starts sniffing me.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
Then what happened?
We got engaged.
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
Why did you stop?
My God. How I'd love to see that.
Smells like dirt.
You get used to it.
You want to go back in?
No. I'll do them later.
Francesca?
What?
Are you all right?
Yes.
Francesca?
Woman friends, too?
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
I told you, I love other people.
But no one in particular.
No. But I love them just the same.
My mistake. I apologize.
What made you ask such a question?
Yes! Hi.
Am I interrupting anything?
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
Oh, sure. Great.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
Yeah?
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
Would you like a beer for your bath?
You want to eat something?
Are you hungry?
Take me somewhere.
How about Italy?
Yes.
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Nobody's asking you to.
No. I couldn't.
Why do you say that?
But you don't mind.
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
I had a temper.
I can't do this, honey.
Long day. Go to sleep.
Sleep all right?
WHY?
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
Yes. And I've accepted.
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
Later. Go back to sleep.
Now?!  It's after eleven.
I can't sleep.
I'm positive.
I'm going to miss you.
Franny?
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
Okay.
What's her name?
Betty.
What's she like?
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
Oh my God...!
About an hour ago.
They're not going to find her!
When did she decide this?
Don't feed that dog.
You people really don't like dogs.
We can't go back there.  Are you crazy? You saw --
Hey, watcha doing with that dog?
He yours, sir?
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
Died there?  How?
Hey, kid.
We practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club.
You think that's really him?
...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
Damn.  That is the ugliest building I have ever seen.
Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.
Shit.
No.  Well, yeah.  Maybe just a little.
Where's the others?
Where's the gangsta of love?
You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.
Climb out to where?
Is this Hell?
That's what?
Wh-wh-whooo?
You got a nice crib here.
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
I said, no thanks.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
Where are we, baby?
But.
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
Sorry, my brother.
What it will be.
What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
You know I can't.
Aren't you going to join us?
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
All the more reason I should be here.
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
Are they on the radio?
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
How do you know?
Careful.  That's bad luck.
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
The dead get out?
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
Cinn?
He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
I can't.  Not yet.
Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
I'm here.
Bill!  Bill?!
I can't find you.
We gotta jump!
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
You got the cash?
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.
What are we doing down here?
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
Please...help me...
What the hell do you want?
You certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  Nice lookin'.
I didn't sell it.
Nice rack.  How old is --
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.
I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
Goddamnit!  How many times I told you --
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
Yeah, you heard of him?
You haven't?
I thought you were bringing the Colonel?
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
But the place burned to the ground.
It's not safe down there.  The fire started down there.  The whole thing could collapse.
Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.
Illibent?  Who's club is that?
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.
Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making too much noise.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
You shouldn't have hit me.
You want to get into this now?
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
So Caesar, what did it total out at?
Where is this going, Johnnie?
Just admit it, Caesar.
Know what?
Open the case!
All right!  Where's the key?
How the fuck can I open it?
The same way you did before.
You don't think I'll do it, do you?
I think you're fucking crazy!
Where is it?
Where's what?
Caesar?  What is this?
Sit down, Gino!
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
We're family, Caesar.
Gimme the gun.
I can't.  I can't.
All part of the business.
I didn't expect --
Oh, shit ...
So, you just got out?
Caesar, what happened?
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww goddammit!
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
They were early.
What are you talking about?
They just left, didn't they?
You mean they weren't up here?
No!  They're still on their way.
That doesn't make any sense.
It couldn't have been.
It was him.  I'm positive.
Got to think this through ...
Caesar, maybe we should run --
Tell them!  Tell them!
...  maybe three hours.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!
It's not here, Caesar.
What are you doing?
Where is the money?
Shut up, Violet!
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
What did she do to you?
You betrayed me!
You murdered Gino!
We were in a car accident --
They were in a car accident.
Now that's teamwork.
I should have let him kill you.
You know he would have done you, too.
Not on duty, sorry.
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
You're helping Rajeev?
How many'd you do?
Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers.
I should be going.
Another time.
Lick me.
You can't kill me yet.
Why?
Yeah?
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Okay, sure, Mick.
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
We was worried about you, Cease.
Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
Is that the money?
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
It's Gino!  It's Gino!
You got the key?
Call me as soon as you get him.
Hello?
No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door.
This is a beautiful place.
So this is temporary for you?
I guessed you were straight black.
You're doing everything yourself?
Truck.
'63 Chevy.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
Caesar is your husband?
Thanks.
He said you lost something.
Okay, one drink.
What do you want?
A beer?
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
No.
I had to see you.
...  I needed that.
You have to ask?
How long have you been with him?
Almost five years.
The redistribution of wealth.
I guess I wanted to.
I'm glad you did.
What's wrong?
Shit, here we go.
What are you afraid of?
I'm not afraid of anything.
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
What you heard wasn't sex.
What was it then?
What about that guy this morning?
You mean Shelly?
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.
Yeah.
Then what?  Exactly.
He hung it up.
What?
And where is it now?
It's in a case, on his desk.
Yes.
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
That's his brother.
Yeah.
Yeah, twice.
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
He does it right in front of him.
What time did you say they would be there?
Where will you be?
What if he sees you?
I'm just asking, what if?
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
Not Caesar.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
Jesus, that's beautiful.
It's me.
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
okay, all right.
Oh, thank God.
I'm sorry, Corky ...
Hey.
Hey.
How'd it go?
No.
Unbelievable.  Can you believe that, Violet?
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
I want a second opinion.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
-- he went inside! --
-- if we can get a clean shot --
Forget it.
What do you want to do?
<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
Treadstone?
Paris.  I live in Paris...
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
What do they want me to do?
...they won't let you go...
So it's time to go home.
I don't think so.
We have to go home, Jason.
Jason...  They can't let you go...
I don't know.
You're a U.S. Citizen?
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Right.
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
Sir, you waited on line.
...yes -- oui -- uh...

Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
Bonjour?  Monsieur?  Allo...
You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
Who?  Who came?
It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
Was it the break-in?
I need a ride.
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
It's a little late for that.
I've got a situation here and --
Get the fuck away from my car.
So what's in Paris?
I want to go home.
I said ten thousand.
You have blood on your pants.
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
I won't hurt you.
What if I say no?
I don't know.
What does that mean?
I don't know.  I don't know who I am.
What?  Like amnesia?
That's what I'm saying.
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
What are you talking about?
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
I was shot twice in the back.
Where are we?
We're about an hour away.
You ever think maybe you have a family?
Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...
Looks familiar?
So this is it, right?
I should go.
Okay, so...
Thanks for the ride.
Look, I don't know what's up there.
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
-- no -- Marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that --
-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
You knew he was coming.
No.
I trusted you.
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
But the police --
-- there's no time --
-- we'll explain it --
-- forget it --
Who paid the bill?
I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.
I don't know. 
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
xxxxxx.
Stop where you are.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
Who is it?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
What was I thinking, right?
I can't protect you anymore.
Can I help you?
This your store?
Think I could rent a scooter?
You have ID?
Shit, we didn't sign in.
Is this it? --  -- this is it, right? --
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
Where's the dog?
My husband's out looking for him.
Get in the basement.
Wait a minute --
Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.
xxxxxx...
And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
Sir...
-- let's check that Interpol window again --
What?
Tell him we're busy.
-- and they're sure it's him? --
-- he accessed the account --
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
-- what're you talking about? --
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
What if it doesn't come back?
You drink rum?
...ervices.
...Be back.
... And then some.
You telephone, sir.
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
...ixed itself.
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
I think we'd better have a look.
What have you got there?
Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... Tuttle
Sign here, please.
Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
What? How do you know my name?
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
What do I have to do.
Er ... Thanks ...
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
You don't have to sing it.
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Go away.
Her name is Jill.
I'm waiting for my daddy.
If I can help you ...
Too late? That's for me to say.
Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
Sam!
Jack!
You are late.
Triplets.
Hello, Jack!
Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.
Jack!!
SAM! What a surprise!
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
Ah ...
Layton! Oh shit!
How do you mean?
How much do you know?
Not much.
Enough though, eh?
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
What has Tuttle done?
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
Er ... no.
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
Yes. I'm impressed.
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
And you're mine.
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
Take her off the list.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
Say it was a mistake.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
Do you know what you're doing.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
Jack?... Jack?
Shut up!
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
How could you do this to me?
Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
I want to report a wrongful arrest.
Yes.
Is it stamped?
Where do I get it stamped?
If you say so.
Are you alright?
It's you ... it's you ...
Who are you? Let go!
Ow! That hurt!
No.
Don't litter my cab!
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
You know, smoking's bad for you.
It's my fucking life.
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
Why?
I didn't like it.
Where are you taking me?
What?
Where are you taking me?
It does doesn't it?
OK. What's in the parcel?
It's heavy.
What are you doing in Information Retrieval?
Looking for you.
No, really.
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
We've got both.
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
Why don't you say, no system is perfect.
Well, no system is.
Well, all wars do -
Who is this war against, Sam?
Well, terrorists of course.
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Every day?
Turn around!
What?
They'll be there waiting.
Who will?
Security.
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
I thought you arrested me.
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 
Cut it out, Sam.
Will you please turn back.
Get away!
Turn!
I was right! Step on it!
Let go! We've got to stop!
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!
Oh God! What have we done?
We? Don't blame me!
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
Shit! The house is on fire!
Are you still following me?
Please, Jill ... I love you.
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
I'm going to open it!
Yes.
What happened to you after ...
They're gone.
Are you sure?
Don't you like parties?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Oh my God, a mistake!
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Information Retrieval.
Don't worry.
But if they did promote you
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
Would you really, Sam?
Really.
A cheque.
The refund for Tuttle!
Here. What do I do next?
That's it.
You are good to me Sam.
I delivered it.
Damn! Blast!
I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?
I never signed the form.
I did it for you.
What! Shit!
It's what you wanted isn't it?
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
This is your dream girl, is it?
Sod it, it's broken!
My mother said it would be all right.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
I won't be held responsible.
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
I'm sorry but ...
You remember Samuel, my son.
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
Numero une, crevettes  la mayonaaise. 
What were we saying?
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
Hello ... hello ...
Hello. Mr Lowry?
Put the phone down and your hands up.
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
My I.D. cards.
No need, sir
Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
Are we?
I don't know which numero.
Yes?
I mean it fixed itself.
Now look what you've done to him.
Have you got one or haven't you?
What the - ? How did you - ?
Sign here please.
What?
For God's sake, what's happened?
What is it?
Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service.
Ha!!
Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?
Are you expecting anyone?
What do they want you or?
Thank you very much. How much will it...?
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
I've never fired anyone in my life.
Pregnant.
No, no, that's impossible.
Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
She say she in great pain.
Is she dying?
She's having a baby. Twins.
You can trust me on this one.
You know each other a long time?
Two years. Ever since we left island.
In that time, you ever have sex?
No underwear?
Hey Cy, guess who's here?
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
Frank, take it easy. what happened?
Frank Pierce.
Where is she?
Sleeping in the back.
I guess I'll be going.
Does that hurt?
So, Frank, am I going to live?
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
What about Kanita?
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
Let's do it!  It's Marcus, Love, only for you.
Okay, what happened?
He's going to be all right, right?
No. He's dead.
What's his name?
You're not going to die.
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
Here, you try.
No, I'd better not.
Do you have any music?
Is he going to be alright?
I know him. That's Noel.
Is there any chance?
It's my first cigarette in over a year.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
He's dead, huh?
Yes.
I think this place stinks.
Our Lady of Misery.
Did you see my father?
How is she?
He's better, though, right?
It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.
How long you been doing this?
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
You asked me not to come.
Promise you won't go inside.
I need to sit down a minute.
This is not a good time.
Who is it?
My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy.
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
It's coming.  Hold her down.
What's that, Frank?
Three legs.
That's too many.
Backup?
I'll drink to that.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
You can't believe how much he's improved.
Last show of the night.
No.
How can that be? He was getting better.
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.
These are hard times, Tom.
Where you going?
The brakes are shot.
I've taken that into consideration.
Mr. Oh.
Whadda we bring?
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
Let's get in a fight, then.
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
Frank!
Do it!
Oh no!--I just remembered.
I'm not hungry.
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
Turn it off.
What?
That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
Don't push it, Larry.
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
Well why didn't you say so?
Faster! God!
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
He's crazy.
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
You're in the stomach!
Stomach again.
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
What did I do to you?
Shut up a second...
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.
Yes.
I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.
Wait.
I don't like being handled.
Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
It's not loaded.
No.  No.
You were smokin' toward the end there.
No.  Don't worry about it.
They booted me out of Washington.
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
London.
London.  That's a promotion!
I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --
He excels at gratitude.
It's nice to see you.
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
Yes.
That's your full name?
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
Eventually rising to...
I don't like the word gay.
Which would you prefer?
A half hour in the lobby.
Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
He must have been great-looking, right?
This conversation is not worthy of you.
Nine seconds.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
Okay.  Great line at the end.
Did you shoot their boots?
We can cut back at the end.
I write for you sometimes.
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
Yes.
I didn't know you were going with him.
Did you bring your grey suit?
As good as humanly possible.
No.
Then it went well.
Did it really go well?
Define your terms.
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
Don't say anything about anything.
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
Really?
I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
Oh, you mean use him...That's nice.  Okay.
I saw the smile -- good piece.
Outside?
I don't know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you.
Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
Okay.  I think I'd better be alone for a while.
The cost-efficient reporter.
Just a few questions?
We came from Washington.
How long has it been since you've been home.
Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
Okay.  I just wanted you to know.
What is she shooting?
I was a little nervous there for a minute.
Jane?
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
You don't have time.  Not a chance.
What did he say?
Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.
It's Aaron.
Play back the last line...
He said something about...
Should I...
Do you want him all the way to the car?
Because...
They're not really going to call security are they?
No, I don't think so.
Follow me.
Bad manners.
No...no.
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
Nobody else had it.
Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
Good.  He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.
...good-bye then.
Ernie, they're calling from work.
What?
Bye, sweetie.
Jane -- For God's sake...  Look, it's time for you to go to sleep.
You don't have to finish tonight.
No.  Not even you.
Why so glum?
I don't know.
No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.
Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will you sign it, please?
Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
I had no idea she was this good.
Hi.  I was worried I was early.
But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
Hi.
How's it going?
So he was indicted?
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
Nervous?
You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.
Jane?
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
Why, you need me for the story?
No.  Were you going to you?
Oh, good.
It's incredible who's here.
At least kiss me when you do that.
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.
Hi.  It's me.
No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
Hello?
Yes.
Okay.  Good night.
No.  Did he really?
Then give me a minute...
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
Then you should stay here.
This is very awkward.
You're saying stay away from him.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
Where's the bathroom?
I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
That's enough.  That's enough.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
Don't you work here?
Would you like to do me?
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
Tonight.
What, right now?
It's kind of dark -
That doesn't look like very much clay.
Oh it's enough...
Are you nervous, Walter?
Not even a little bit?
A girl with a body like mine?
What!
Look -  This pose is all wrong!
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
What the hell's going on?
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
What did he do?
See you later -
Don't worry about him...what have you got?
You really like it?
Great!  What is it?
It's a...full length life-size figure!
What's it called?
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
Hi Walter.
Is it murdered man?
You think she's better than Murdered Man?
Where where...
Walter!  Jeez!
Did you hear what he said?
Yes Walter.
It's true, isn't it?
I know what it is to be ignored.
I mean, you look so pretty.
Thank you.
Are you ready?
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
Nice night out...
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
You think I'm creative?
Of course I do!
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy.
Walter...there's...
Walter...stay away from me!
That's word for word.
Here you go, enjoy.
It was.
Walter...I can't believe it.
Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...
Are you trying to be funny?
What's the matter with you?
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
Would you pose for me for free?
Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
Look at that, man.  Big deal.
Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...
Man look at that get up !
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Man this is heavy!
What did he say?
Didn't you hear him?
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
Walter, what are you doing?
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
Well I brought something, I wanted to show you.
What is it, your laundry?
Where'd ya buy that?
You...made that?
Dead Cat!
Dead Cat?
You want to buy it, put it in the club?
I didn't mean to.
Go home.
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
You know what that proves?
Yeah, why?
You might talk too much.
What do you have in the box?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
Well, w-what did you do?
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
How ya doin'?
Hm.
Police officer.
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
Walter shut up and relax!
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
Are you done with these?
I saw your...cat.
And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?
Hi.
After that we go no more!
I won't say good luck, Walter.
I thought you didn't respect money!
I get it Walter.  I get it.
What do you get?
It's like...you've turned on.
You don't have to do anything!
T-tell him that?
If you see him.
Good night Walter...
What's all the noise in here!
I was just straightening up the place.
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!
What's wrong with you!?!
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
I had him in my grasp.
The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
I like it.  Can I be your friend?
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
Nice to feel needed.
Let's move out!
Buffy!  Looking tasty.
Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these guys want?
Booo!
Suck!
Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
It's coffee.
You're the guys from the movie!
Hey!  She wasted my dog!
Would you sleep with them?
Invite me in, Pike.
I'm fine.
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
Get away from here.
I'm hungry.
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Which way did she go?
Excellent.
Oh, my God.  Is that true?
Dying.
Hi, Buffy.
Do you know what time it is?
Buffy, honey?
Maybe.
What's Bobby gonna say?
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
You okay?
Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
What show is this?
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
What'd you dream about?
Nothing.
Come on, what was it?
Hey there.
Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
Buffy, what are you doing here?
I thought we were meeting here.
Didn't you get my message?
You broke up with my machine?
You left me a message?
You're even weaker than the others.
I am a God!  A God!
Will you guys shut up, please?
Hi.
Hi there.
You want some water or something?
Not exactly.
Yeah.
Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
Where are you gonna go?
Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
Things are kind of confusing.
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
Hey, Buffy...
I know.
Thanks.
Who?
I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing?
A dress.
Dress, huh?  What for?
For the dance.
I'm going to the senior dance.
I'm going to the dance.
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
He did what he was supposed to.
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
I crashed your party.
Pretty shallow of you.
That's me.
Good thing one of us was prepared.
Are you okay?
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
It is a pretty crucial subject.
Can't.  History report.  The Normans and the Saxons.
Bogutude.  Blow it off.
Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
) What do you think?
What are we doing?
Why don't we see a movie?
Excuse much!  Not rude or anything.
What did Jeffrey's dad say?
Let's meet tonight, okay?
Where?
I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
Excuse me for having something important to do.
Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
Yeah, whoops I came.
You look way pretty, Kim.
I'm looking for you, actually.
What are you talking about?
Why?
To bring you... your birthright.
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
Time to do what?
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
Just stay away from me, okay?
I was a slave.
How do you know all this?
Cramps?
None of your business.  God.
All right.  What do we do now?
Where's the other one?
Meet me at this address after school.
Why do you keep saying that?
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
What?
But you enjoyed it, yes?
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
Who we gonna beat?
Who we gonna beat?
No -- you don't have to --
Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
I had to test you.
But you threw a knife at my head!
Last night.  You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
They were vampires?
Same one.
What!?!
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
You are such a wet.
Five?
Not if you're careful.
I wish you would.
It isn't important.
As for example, what?
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
I want to die.
Football is my life.
Wait!
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
No THX.
I was just scared is all.
That is so cool.
Thank you very much.
Cassandra's really smart.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
Nicole...
Hi, guys.
I haven't seen him tonight.
What's happening?  What do you want?
So very much.
Really?
The mark of the Coven.
I'm just a girl.
Bessel!  What are you doing here?
Could be.
You think so?
Got that.
Write that down.
Oh, yes!  Yes!
Buffy?
No --
Okay, let's go.
I can't believe they still ate it.
And Spring Fling.
Omniplex?
Buffy!
Cool!
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
They'll kill us!
Oh, God.
God!  Take a chill lozenge.
The homelesses?
Environment.  That's cool with me.
Oh, yeah!
If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
Smell of booze much.
Oh, thank you very much.
Except for Prom.
It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
Ah, you'll be coming back.
I don't think so.
All right.  Take care of yourself.
You mean Nuke.  You said "Crash".
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
Big League pitchers don't use these.
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
The right nostril.  Good.
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
How was that?
Nuke?!
Just till I lose.
Get over here.
No.
No, no, it was great.
How 'bout a back rub?
I'll tuck you in.
You can't seduce me.
That's my leg.
Fundamentals?
No!  You're playing with my mind!
I'm trying to play with your body!
Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
I did.
We lost.
I'd like you to meet my father.
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
It's Skip, for you.
That's great!
Well I guess this is it.
Neither will I.
I think I'm ready for the Show.
Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?
Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.
I'm Crash Davis.
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
Crash, I didn't think you--
Oh my...  Don't leave...
See my hips?
But you were pulling your hips last night.
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
Damn.
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
Damn.
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
Crash...I want you.
He' s confused--
Aren't we all?
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
And now you wanta teach me?
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
It's possible.
I got released.
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
Yeah...you a witch?
Annie---
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
Ninety-five miles an hour.
Oh dear....easy honey...
Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
Ninety-three miles an hour.
Ebby's told me a lot about you.
God bless you.
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
You need a nickname.
Which one of us?
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
The socks?  It's cold in here.
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
Will that work for me?
If you believe in Voodoo.
No, that is not belief.  That is desperation.
I got him on the knee!
Don't bump me.
It was a cocksucking call!
You missed the tag!
You spit on me!
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
You're a cocksucker!
I thought I was--
But he ain't seen my heat--
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
He did know.
How?
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
Party without me.
Can I ask you something?
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.
I'm going to the Show.
I'm trying to thank you.
Settle what?
You fuck!
Good.  Good.  That's terrific...
Sorry about last night.
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.
Nuke--  Good luck.
I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?
I don't know.  I haven't caught anything yet.
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
Step outside, pal.
I don't believe in fighting.
Take the first shot at me.
Don't try me.
She's playing with my mind.
Who you calling a "boy"?
Hi, Jimmy.  Want a ride?
Well tell 'em, honey.
Where's Ebby?
Little high.
He walked eighteen?!
It's a league record.
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.
Patkin was a tribute to baseball...
What the hell's going on out there?
It's a damn convention.
What'you want, kid?
Jim looking for somebody.
Looking for Crash Davis.
Ain't here.
Where does he go?
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
Thank you.
I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.
Look at yours.
...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
You were never my guest?!
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
You were wandering around.
This is a very auspicious occasion.
A powerful man.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
You got it.
...stupid things.
Watch it, partner, watch it!
Oh, good.
Yeah.
Stop -
Wait, hold on a second.
Hey!
Okay.
M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
Hello.
She's not here, Sam.
You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone.
Right away.
Hello? Hello! Ginger.
Amy! Amy, open the door!
I can't! I'm tied!
When did this happen, honey?
I don't know.
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
I'll take Columbia for twenty.
They payin'?
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
Okay, Sammy.
Somethin', huh?
Yeah.
...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...
I'm sorry about this. Really.
All right, Ace?
Okay.
In other words, I'm fucked.
Hello.
Hey, Ace.
No, I don't wanna come -
You should say so.
Just say so.
I'll be honest with you.
You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
Yeah.
You lost your control.
I lost control?
My wife?
Hey, she came to talk...
Please...
...don't do it to me...
It's none of my business?
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
Practice enough this week, you prick?
Yeah.
Meet me at three.
What - what, Caesar's?
No, a...
What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here!
I just told you. She called me.
And what'd she want?
Hello.
Sammy.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
It's me.
Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?
No, I'm not okay.
Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.
Yeah, she's here.
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
Hey, it is my pleasure.
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
No problem.  Sorry.
Okay. You come by the house?
Seven o'clock?
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
You go and put your things away.
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Hello.
Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
You've got to stop her.
No, Ace.
Half of everything is mine.
Ace, listen to me.
Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
Well, sir, I was just...
I...
...position...
We need this guy.
We can't get rid of him?
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
Nice to see you, Senator.
Certainly.  Senator.
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
To Abraham Lincoln.
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
Sam, we got a problem.
Now, he's really pissed.
No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
Okay. Just take it easy.
Right away. Okay?
I-I'll do it.
I'm going to go powder my nose. 
Ginger's mission in life was money.
I'll be right back.
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
She took care of the dealers...
Hey, Mitch.
Thank you.
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
I - I - I...
Yeah.
Why're you crying?
Yeah.
You're with me now.
Yeah.
Right?
Uh-huh.
It's chinchilla.
Oh, it's so soft.
It's nice isn't it?
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
Okay, want to go with Mommy?
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
Why do you need that much?
Yeah, how do I know?
You can't make me stop caring...
Yes, I - yes, I do.
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
What's it...
...under?
Pretty serious.
How serious?
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
It's under...
...twenty-five thousand?
Yeah.
Okay?
So, what'd ya do with it?
With what?
With the money.
He needed some clothes.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
He wanted a watch, too.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Would you knock it off, Sam?
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!
I want you out of here! I want you out of here!
Take your  fuckin' bag and get out of here!
The arrangement is over!
You're lower than a dog!
Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there!
Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
You're not takin' Amy.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.
I threw it away.
I put her to bed.
Oscar wants you to call him.
And where'd you go?
To the Riviera.
What'd you have?
I had a... salad.
What did Jennifer have?
Why do you want to do that?
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
Who were you with?
What if he won't stop?
I mean, it could get us both killed.
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-
Oh, sh-
Listen to me.
Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
You want your jewelry?
Get - get up!
I wouldn't do that...
So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
You get down here!
You come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
You are not threatening me anymore!
Oh, you are...
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
I am calm!
But it was just mine.
...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without...
...Well, I've got a large family.
It won't happen again, Sam.
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
...worst possible time for me.
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
Can't do it with both hands?
Can you do it with your left hand?
So, you're a righty?
Excuse me.
What?
Is this yours? Your pen?
Yeah.
Get out of here.
Yeah?
No, no? You didn't?
Thanks, Nick.
I don't want to go to Europe.
You know where she gets this from!
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
You gotta go back out there.
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
Hey.
Mrs Ro- Mrs Rothstein! Okay, shh!
Fucker!
Can I go in?
That's not a problem, that's not a p-
Can I go in?
Go get a bag, man.
And here. Here.
You just - Just stop him.
Pitch-black?! It -
Come on. I'm sorry.
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Leave me alone!
Here we go!
Is that what you did?
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
It's instinctive, you know.
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
He's comin' over.
Oh.
We're waiting on Carmine.
Carmine left?
He's gone?
He's not here?
Carmine left?
Artie!
Calm down! Calm down!
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
Stay out of the way!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
Hey, Frankie.
How are you?
I'll take care of it, Remo.
I know.
It's in all the papers.
What're you gonna do?
And I mean... that's no good.
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
No. I ain't see anything like that.
I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
I understand.
You got a round figure on it?
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
Yeah.
Hi, Jennifer.
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
Hi, how are you?
Sure.
Am I right?
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
Okay.
Thanks.
Thank you.
You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
What? What?
Yeah?
Let me think about that.
Mm-hm.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
You did. You're right.
I did what you told me to.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
Sure did.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
I do. I need a new sponsor.
Is that what you want?
A sponsor.
It's what you want?
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
Get the fuck out of here.
All right. Be careful.
So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
...same outfit.
Yes!
Thank you. Very nice.
Come on.
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
Get lost?
Get lost?
Well, how 'bout that?
All right.
Okay?
I'm always here for you.
Don't make me come there. Answer me.
No, Lester.
Promise?
...all the luck in the world.
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
It means I got the money.
Lester - he called you here.
Right.
He was just on the phone.
He called you right here.
What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.
No, I'm gonna drive.
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.
Listen...
...they're in Penthouse K.
They check in alone?
They checked in alone.
Are they out now?
Yes, don't worry.
There's more!
Hey, how you doin'? 
Incredible.
Two.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
'Cause it clogs up your heart.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Ace saw Vegas one way.
Smarten up.
Get up.
Come here, come here.
What's takin' so long over there?
She asleep?
I took care of everybody.
You walk past me?
And this is Stacy.
Stacy. 
This is Nick.
Fine. Everything's goin' good.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
They're havin' a good time too.
Sue me, you Jew fuck!
You must have drunk too much.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
Don't know.
Calm down, calm down. Shh!
Get out. Get out! Get out!
Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
Frankie!
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
No more fuckin' dirty work!
Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!
Ch-Charlie M!
Charlie M?
Tony.
How you doin'?
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
You sure?
I'm positive.
Well, I'm a little confused here.
You're a little confused?
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
Hey! Oh!
Oh, sorry -
What's the matter with you?
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
That's enough.
Take it easy, though.
All right, all right. But I - I -
Hi.
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
The crowd bought it.
Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.
You say that like an amnesia victim.
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
Are you sure?
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
She has a real spirit.
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
God, can you hear me!
Wha-at?
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
Yeah, this is better than rape.
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
What a "drag."
Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.
God-damn..
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
Car wash, Captain?
My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
Oh, I wish they wouldn't feed him like that.
I loved you.
I still have one left...
Spooky.
For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
I'm a good mother!
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
What's the name of your child's best friend?
How much?
But of course you are.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Hey, Captain God!
What did--?
Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
Did you try to kill...
What?
You are...
You're late.
I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
I don't know if I can do it alone.
What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for?  Dance with me?
Nice breasts.
Where do you think you're going?
Any place.
I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?
I don't see anybody in there but you.
Was someone in an accident?
I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
Have you got to tell her your life story?
What if they do question the authenticity?
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
Who's on the phone?
What was that for?
I didn't hurt you.
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
Theo wants to talk again.
Then whose is it?
You gotta just look the other way.
Are you guys all right?
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?
Let's have your license, mister.
How do we get back to the freeway?
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.
You switched license plates?
What do you mean tip the cops?  Is the man a lunatic or what?
Just hand up on the bitch!  Fuck you, madam.  And goodbye!
I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
If you know that just back off.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
And stop with the directions.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
Got your badge?
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
I thought you said you could handle him.
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
And what're you whispering for?
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
Who smashed the phone?
I don't believe you.
My name is --
I don't want to know --
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
You won't disconnect.
Oh won't I?
Because you know you'll be killing us.
The cops could trace this call back to you.
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
Please.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.
How much time do you have left on it?
A woman?
What do you do for a living?
Sometimes I paint.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
That makes two of us.
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
Make a right.  You can't miss it.
Lenore, I'm here.  I'm getting out.
Does she wear glasses?
No.
What's happening?
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
The one in Brentwood.
What do you mean?
Don't say that.
Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
To hide it from the I.R.S.
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
Did you jiggle the phone?
No.
Did you hear that click?
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
Or somebody else there is listening in --
Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
No.  I hear them.  They're coming upstairs.  They know!
Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
Lucky for them they didn't.
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
Yes sir.
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
Yes.
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
Rachel -- Oh my God.
Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.
Now I have -- it's a long story.
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
He had a gun.  I have it now.
You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
There isn't any such person.
The guy with the transplant.
Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
I thought it was inspired.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
Who's in back?
L.A.P.D.
Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello.
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
A typical fuck-up.
You were at the Emerald that night?
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
What's Nels' number?
Do you think they'll walk away?
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.
What's really on your wicked little mind?
What's your point?
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
Naturally.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
That's not good enough.
Took preparation.
Know what else is in here?
You won't live to see it.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ...
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
Who is this?
Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
They saw you kill the driver.
Where do we meet?
What time frame have you got in mind?
Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
I'm here.  Where are you?
I don't know what you mean.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
Stop the crying.
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
Count it.
Seems like it.
Who am I talking to?
If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
I thought you'd know me by now.
What does it take to kill you?
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
How far off are you?
Five minutes.
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
We're gonna get there first.
Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
Who were you talking to?
Since when did you guys start changing tires?
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
Who are you?
Let me talk to the lady again.
Can I make a quick call?
Government business?
Undercover.
You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
So can we consider you a regular, sir?
It takes all types.
He's what she should run a mile from.
Then why doesn't she?
She's not a girl, Col --
See that, Col?
See what, Dil?
Yeah?
What you think?
Saw that one.
What would you call it?
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
He agreed that he was.
What do you think his name is?
He's still looking, Col.
Persistent.
Good thing in a man.
An excellent quality.
Maybe he wants something.
He's back, Col
Stop it, Dil --
You see that, Col?
Fuck it, is what I say.
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
You fucking promised.
Did I?
Thank you.
Who the fuck is he?
Jimmy.
It's him, isn't it?
Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
Sure, Dave --
Take your clothes.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Fuck off back to Essex!
Don't chuck my clothes out!
Look, I'm sorry.
Do you mean that?
She's not a tart.
No, of course not, she's a lady.
If I was her I'd consider that an insult.
What's that supposed to mean?
How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
Not in my experience.
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
Someone recommend you?
In a way.
Who?
Guy I work with.
Doesn't the water get to your nails?
What's it to you?
No.
No.
Scottish?
How'd you guess?
The accent, I suppose.
And what's it like?
That should make her happy.
Who's she?
Tell her I'm very happy with it.
Jimmy.
Everybody wants something.
Hi.
What was that?
Yes, thank you.
What was that all about?
Perform?
You know.
You on the game?
He's getting up.
Where?
Give me that look again.
What's that about?
They're jealous.
Why?
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
How special?
Jesus Christ!
Would you like a drink?
Yes, please.
What'll it be?
Someone out there.
Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?
Must be in love to manage that.
He lived here with you?
He was different.
As different as it's possible to be.
Tell me about him.
No.
Shouldn't I go?
Yes...
Are you jealous of him?
Maybe.
Do you miss him?
What do you think?
I think you do.
You say that like a gentleman.
But you can t stay, you know that?
Didn't think I could.
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
Did he come here too?
Maybe.
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
What does that mean?
You mean that?
Drink.
What is this?
Can't leave me now.
The thing is, can you go the distance?
What you thinking of, hon?
I'm thinking of your man.
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
Even now.
Dil --
Tell him it hurt --
Come on, Dil --
Don't call me that.
Sorry, darling.
Give it over, Dil --
You're something else, Dil, you know that?
You could?
Do you care, Jimmy?
Sure I do.
You mean that?
My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
Shut up.
Made me feel all funny inside.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
You think that's wise?
I didn't mean to hit you.
That's a start.
So I'm sorry.
How?
Ask to meet me again.
Will you meet me again?
When?
Do they know?
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Details, baby, details.
So they do know.
Don't.
Probably.
Kind of wish I didn't.
You can always pretend.
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
Are you pretending yet?
There's Dave. He knew too.
A little.
Don't ask me in.
Please, Jimmy.
No. Can't pretend that much.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Should have stayed a girl.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
Happy now?
What?
So I got it wrong, then.
Not at all, honey.
Don't.
Come on.
Why, honey --
Come on.
You gonna tell me why?
Dil, this is Jude.
Shouldn't be, Dil
She own you, Jimmy?
She from Scotland too?
You could say that.
What you doing, Jimmy?
Anything.
You'd do anything for me?
You want another haircut, baby?
You said anything, Dil
Why?
Yes.
And you wouldn't leave me?
No.
You promise?
You're no good at this, Jimmy.
You want to make me look like him...
So it's true, then?
Don't call me that --
Why?
For me.
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
I'm going home!
Told you to stay in the hotel!
Come on...
I was trying to get out of something.
You mean that?
You heard what I said, Dil?
Prescription. For my condition.
Are you supposed to take that many?
Are you all right, Dil?
Good-bye, Dil
Jimmy?
You knew which man?
Your soldier.
You knew my Jody?
Died...
In a manner of speaking.
You killed my Jody
I suppose I tried.
You tried.
Why?
Got to be somewhere.
You like me now, Jimmy?
I like you, DIl
Love me.
Yes.
Tell me you love me.
Whatever you say, Dil.
Then say it.
You do?
Say it again.
And you'll never leave me?
What's Fergus?
It's my name, Dil --
Yes.
Tell me what she wore.
You've got to go now, Dil --
Do I?
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Not if you go.
Will I see you again?
I promise.
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
The Metro.
Meet Col --
As the man said, it's in my nature.
Lucky you.
What was it?
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
So what do you need, Fergus?
Need to go across the water.
Do you now.
Need to lose myself awhile.
See does he want some.
Hey -- what's he like?
Horny bastard.
You don't know that.
Tough work, that.
Leave us, Judie.
I heard.
Eddie and Tinker died.
So you did fuck up.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
No way, Jude. I'm out.
But, then, I don't have a choice.
Och, you do, Fergie.
Of course. I forgot.
And then you'll leave her out of it?
And what if I say no?
You were made for this.
Perfect.
And what if you don't?
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
Yes?
Who's the old geezer?
You a handyman, Fergie?
Give him a cup of tea.
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
Why would you do that?
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
Thanks.
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
So he knows your name?
I told him.
Yes.
You OK about that?
Why do you want to do that for?
Would make me feel better about it.
So it was you all the time.
Who'd you think it was?
I thought it was Dave.
And who's Dave when he's at home?
He's at home.
Should blow you away, you know that?
I understand.
Definitely unusual.
And who is she?
Aye, I do, Peter.
Thank God for that.
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Hope not.
So it's on the street.
Right.
Fuck you.
Eat something, would you?
This is a farce, man.
I seen your fucking face.
Am I?
Thank you, handsome.
How did you know it was her?
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.
No fucking way.
No?
Nope. Not handsome at all.
You trying to hurt my feelings?
Hey --
Do what?
They won't let him die.
You want to bet?
Why can't we?
What do you know about my nature?
I'm talking about your people, not you.
Shut the fuck up, would you?
And you know the funny thing?
No, what's the funny thing?
What?
She'd be anyone's type.
Don't you think of it, fucker.
No?
Absolutely not.
She your wife?
You make a nice couple.
Don't I know it.
So what were you fucking around for, then?
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
What the fuck am I doing here.
What the fuck were you doing here?
You could have said no.
Can't. Once I signed up.
And you play cricket?.
Best game in the world.
Best game in the world.
Never.
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
Now, that was worth waiting for.
Now put it back in.
Shut up, would you?
Fergus?
See? I was right about you.
Don't be so sure.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
Having a pint in the Rock.
My special friend.
We don't look on it like that.
I've often wondered how you do it.
Depends on what you believe in.
What do you believe in?
That you guys shouldn't be here.
It's as simple as that?
I didn't.
She can't help it.
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
Don't know her.
What?
If they kill me --
See if she's all right.
I don't know her.
Don't.
Help me.
Go to sleep now.
What?
A story.
Like the one about the frog?
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
When I was a child...
Nothing.
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
Stop that talk now --
Faster than cricket?
You stupid bastard --
What you say, faster?
I said you bastard -- stop --
Hurling --
What?
What if I did?
You didn't?
And you know what?
Not here.
Who gives a fuck.
I never know nothing.
Come and get me, soldier --
Thought you liked me, bitch.
It was fun while it lasted.
Have you no feelings, woman?
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
I said shut the fuck up --
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
That fucker's dead --
Give me the shooter, Jude --
You're crazy --
All right -- where's the letter?
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
I could eat a horse.
That's right.
Oh, you should see your face.
What about it?
What's the matter?
Adam!
You don't look so bad in this light.
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
What is it?
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
Where's that airlines bag?
Lord, you're stubborn.
Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.
I love you, Adam.
Reggie -- I think I've found --  are you on?
I think it only said where -- but I can't --
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
I know, but this is all we've got left.
It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for.
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
Reggie -- why won't you listen?
But I didn't kill anybody.
Reggie -- please believe me!
Reggie -- listen to me!
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
You didn't have to chase me so hard --
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
I said, tell me to go to the --
I heard you, I heard you.
Then say it.
Reggie -- listen to me --
Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
You mean spies and things like that?
Only we call them agents.
We? You mean you're --?
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Ours.
Oh, I see.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
I believe you.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
Because they're still here.
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
No.
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
Gratine, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
Are you sure there's no mistake?
It's Charles!
He looks so young -- when was this taken?
No.
That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
Then how do I know this is your office?
Starting with his own.
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
What's your first name today?
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
Yes.
But you're -- divorced?
No.
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
You'd lie about anything.
What now?
How long do you intend -- ?
Sorry about that.
Do I knock or something?
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
Then who does?
Me?
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
Good morning, Mr. Dyle.
It's the only name I've got. How about you?
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
Carson Dyle is dead.
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
I left him hanging around the American Express.
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
Would you like to see my passport?
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Alexander.
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
Yes, but we're divorced.
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
You can't.
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Which one are you?
Whitefoot, of course.
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
Why can't you be serious?
There, you said it.
Okay.
Cutting it out.
Who told you to do that?
You did.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
They've got Jean-Louis!
What day is it?
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
Maybe.
Or Tex?
I think Tex did it.
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
I'd love some, thanks.
Hm?
What? Assassinate somebody?
Shut the door!
The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
Fiction or non-fiction?
Why don't you shut up!
Well!
Are you going to listen?
I don't believe it.
Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
How much is it worth?
The money is unimportant.
I'm afraid it is important.
What's its value today?
In money.
I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
And if it is?
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
What do you mean, no?
Mrs. Lampert --
What do you want?
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
You loved him?
Swiss.
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
He didn't have one.
He was a wealthy man?
I don't know. I suppose so.
About how wealthy would you say?
I don't know.
Where did he keep his money?
I don't know.
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
I know.  I'm sorry.
Is it all right?
Is that all? Can I go now?
Of course it is.
I don't understand.
I was, too.
In Mr. Dyle's room?
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voil!
I found it! I found it!
Up there! It is up there!
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?
Why, do you think we're going to?
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
Peter Joshua.
I'm Regina Lampert.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Yes.
Good for you.
Please, not on my account.
No, you see, I don't really love him.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Yes, but we're divorced.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Shakespeare never said that.
How do you know?
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Charles is.
How did you find out?
Where did everything go?
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Do you know what you're going to do?
I don't know where to go.
What's going on?
Don't you understand French?
I'm still having trouble with English.
What was all that?
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
You mean you and me?
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
How do you shave in there?
What was what?
We're here.
On the street where you live.
What?
Nothing. Good night.
Peter -- are you all right?
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
Go on.
That's all.
Yes -- that's right.
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
I believe what he said.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
Words can hurt very much.
Don't put yourself out.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
You know what I want, Miz Lampert...
Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
But why do you want a divorce?
Because I don't love him.
He knows everything.
Do you know him?
I've never seen him before.
He must have known Charles pretty well.
How can you tell?
Who is it from?
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
What's the matter, chrie?
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
Yeah? What's that?
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
I never fucked Rod.
I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
I get all your CDs.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
One more time.
No.
But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
She's my daughter, Tom.
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
It's almost ten o'clock.
Daddy you scared me!
It won't happen again.
Hi honey.
I want you to head right home after school.
What do you mean?
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
A little.
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
No honey.
You are upset.
I'm not.
It was a she.
Are you sure?
You know her?
It can't be.
No I wasn't.
No!
Are you sure?
Is Jody still awake?
Well?
She's still a virgin.
What are you doing?
This will relax her.
Hello?
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
She's not here.
St. Michael's.
Of what?
A bullet to the right cerebellum.
Can you get inside?
Really?
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
Your brother told us.
We just found another body.
But I shouldn't shut it down?
Pay no attention to me.
You fucked me up!
What?
You gave me a 'D'.
I'm sure you should have failed.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
You aren't going to the party?
Of course I'm scared.
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
What do you know about my father?
Go sit next to him.
Who?
Mark Shale.
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
Oh nice save.
I promised I'd go right home after school.
You can't tell your parents.
Especially not your dad.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
Twenty eight years ago.
This place is empty.
Cut it out.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
Are you O.K.?
I'm fine.
I heard you got attacked.
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
Did Sharon say no?
You know I want to go with you.
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
I'll think about it.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Are you coming to the party?
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
That's not why we broke up.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
Jody. Wait.
What are you doing?
Hi mom.
Hi princess.
Mom?
I need to ask you something.
You can ask me anything.
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
What?
That's what he said.
Who is she?
Wait.
And the police did nothing?
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Two men left town right after it happened.
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
Yes.
Yes?
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
On what side of the family?
His mother's side.
You ok?
Just thinking about something.
I got to go.
What?
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
You can have both if you want.
You're so beautiful.
Now don't be nervous.
Ok.
No.
You can't bring it.
Hey! That was a 3k machine.
I said no.
Maybe it won't stay in.
If sheep don't count.
That wasn't me ...
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
Rod!
You're being unfair.
Unfair?!
Stacy?
Okay, okay.
At least somebody likes this shit.


help me get in the truck. 
 Oh...
...shit.
 Oh, shit.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.

Shit!
...that is going to explode...
...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
Come on, Night Shift.
...-ty.
Where do you want this stuff?
Freezer in the back.
Great. 
That's my business.
No argument there.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
Since when does...
Since today.  New policy.
Well, he told me to collect cash.
Andy.  Another fuckin'...
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
Oh.
Why don't I--?
Aw!  Oh, Jesus.
Sorry, man.  He's dead.
I need your truck.
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
Peace.
You want cash?
You want cash?
I got, like, uh....
...doing?!
I need your truck!
Go on.
Would you hurry up, please?
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you 
What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
That dog was mean before I met him.
That dog ain't mean.
I'm gonna stomp your a--
...up.
Are you kiddin'?

Come on!
Damn.
It happens to this piece of shit...
...all the time.
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
 Excuse me...
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?

...town. 
We're clear.
...-er.
I ain't goin' through Missoula!
Am I missing somethin' here?
Yeah, borrowed!
You stole this truck.
You stole this truck!
I did not steal this truck!
That's...
...fine.
I ain't playin' that.

 
God-...
...-damn!


You're nuts, goin' back there!
Shut up.
Take your gun!
Doesn't work.
What?
Doesn't...
...work!  It's not even load-...
Oh, shit.


All right.
    Elvis is on ice again.
Okay.
 Nice job back there.
...gun?!
I was thankin' you, asshole!
Kiss my ass!
...I'm not the psycho.
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
...-cho and a hijack-...
...-er!
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
You wanna hit me?
And I'm a peaceful man, and...
...I believe in live and...
 Yeah...
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.


Holy shit...
...man!
Oh, shit.
Back up!  Back...
...up!
Come on, old...
...Pete!  Come on!  There it...
...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
Fuck! 

Oh, shit.
I think...
Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
Oh, shit.
That's right.  Now,  move!


Oh, shit.
 Okay.

Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.
Oh, shit.
Come on, old Pete.
Come on!
Come on, old Pete.
 Oh...
...easy, easy, easy.
Left, left, left!
Get over!  Get over!
Come on.
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
...Pete!  Come on.
Come on, old Pete.  Oh.
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
...Night Shift, but you might...
Come on, old...

Come on.
Come on.
Come on...
Whoo!
I made it!
You okay?
What the fuck was that?!
Shit.  You gotta pass him. 
Gee, you think so?
Holy--!
 Okay.  That didn't work.
Shut up!

Ho, ho...
 Oh...
...ho!
 ...shit!

 
Hang on!
Hey!


 Shit. 
 Go on.
 Go, go.


Come on.
 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 

Okay.
All right.
Okay.
All right.
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
 Okay.  Okay. 
Yeah...
...yeah.
 Aw, shit  
All right, let's go.

Okay.  All right.  Okay. 
 Listen!  Listen...
...to him!  You don't know who...
...you're dealin' with!
I'm a dangerous man!
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
...man!
He's crazy!
Taking it down the hill.
You're--?  What?!
Then stay...
What?
Come on!

Keep still.
Okay.  Okay.


Oh, shit!
No!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!

 All right.  Hey.




Uh-oh.
Okay.
Worth a try.
...did you?
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
...piece of shit was worth.
It won't even start half the time.
 Yeah.
We were nationally  ranked.
Robert Del Rio?
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
We got two paddles.
To tell you the truth, you didn't.
Not completely, anyway.
I mean, if that gun was...
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
...split.
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...
...miles.

That is loud!  I'm 
 Whoo!
All right, all right.  Hey, hey.
Hey.   Mason.
I think you oughta cut a...
...deal with this asshole.
Even though it is nice to see Andy...
...or my conscience.
A-And you  owe me...
...man.
 

Ow!  


Are you all right?
Listen, Arlo.

They're takin' off.
They're movin'.
Hey, just shut up.
We're gonna die!
Arlo, shut up.
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!
Hey, hey, hey.
What?
Arlo!  Arlo.
Reach into my pocket.

 Come on!
Oh.
 Okay.
Yeah.
 Okay.

Okay. 
 All right.  Okay.

Okay. 

Arlo!

Okay. 

Okay, here we go.

Come here.
Go, go, go! 

 That's why I didn't give it...
...to him. 
What?
Sometimes the prey bites back.
Go!

Stop.
Hang...
...-ful?!
Oh, fuck!
Forty-five seven!
We!
  I've got the real thing!
Here...
...they come!
And Brynner's right on...
...our ass!
Okay...
...here comes the...
...tunnel!
Whoo!
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
What the hell?
What the--?
Stupid.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Shoot me. 
 What's it say? 
Forty-nine point four.
Mason.
What?

All right 
Oh.

Come on.  Come on.
What?
 
What?
It's working.



We got-...
...-ta get outta here!
 Vitelli! Vitelli!
 There's gotta be...
...another way  outta here.    Hey.
Hold this. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Sorry.
Hang on, hang on.
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
They'll meet you at the top.
Look out.
What'd you come back for?!
Why'd you stay behind?!

 Well.

We're the shit.  Bigtime.
Stop limpin' around like that.
You did help a little.
Who drove the ice cream...
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Who had to put a gun to your head?
Who put the big hurt on...
You, Arlo.
Hello.
Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
Patriotism is its own reward.
I think so too.
 Yeah.
Thank you.
...face" crap you've been telling me?
No.
Oh!
Oh, oh!
I feel faint.
 big balls.
Hey.
Hey, be cool.
Be cool.  Be--
We're worried...
...about him.
...within five minutes.
Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
I urge you to be persuasive.
This country trained me to kill...
...without compunction.
Well, well, well.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?

And it won't be pleasant. 
Vaughn.

Well, that just about figures for today.
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
Mason, you have to take this...
...take my sorry old truck.
So you called the damned thing Elvis
I had no idea how powerful it was.
 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
...here.   Mason... 
You got a prob-...
Listen, deputy.
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
What?  Say again...
 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
We've got it...
...owe you.
We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
...including the permanently extreme.



Whoo-hoo! 

They were all wearing hardware.
...to be off the island tonight.
And I changed the schedule.
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
Now, I know.  You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
"I am become Death, the...
...destroyer of worlds."
No!
Is this stool taken?
No, go--
You look good, Richard.
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
...and the government.
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
Went away? 
"Went away."  I like that.
And let me guess.  You failed.

Do you know what'll...
...happen if I drop this?
Brynner.
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
Good to see you again, Leo.
Pleasant surprise.
I can't say it's a surprise.
I checked your release date.  I never liked coincidences.
...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
...-enworth.  I'll have no compunction at all about using this.
I'll do it.
 There's nothing in here, sir.  They got away with it.

...comes up that road.

Radio the bikes.
And so Missoula's prodigal son returns.
Of which we have more than enough.
Hit him again.


There.
It's clean.
Check the immediate area.
This was supposed to be a...
Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready.
Dennis!
Get your links set up!
I wanna patch in from...
What about these two?
I'm on it.
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here.
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
I'm Colonel Brynner, U.S. Special Operations Com-...
...-mand out of Fort Bragg.
We were called in by the Jerome base...
...-ty.
...general store.
Richard Long.
Where's their protective...
...gear?
Mornin'.
Is this your establishment?
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
I assume you want that to go.
Assumptions are always...
...dangerous.
...deer.
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.
I assume you have one.
Doc...
...time to time, yeah.
Not tonight...
...though.
Odd, then, that his car...
...should be right outside.
Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...
I want you to look at one another...
...and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared...
...to die for a country that's...
...on this miserable road to nowhere.
And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.
I don't see my container.
You try anything, it goes in...
...-tainer!
Where's Arlo?
Your fellow hero, untouched...




 







No.
Where's Elvis?!
Dead, last time I...
 ...checked. 







Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?
You'd never understand!

Oh.  Well, I have got to get to the dentist be-...
I can handle it.
Yeah?
Be sure you feed Bosco.
...ready before the morning crowd blows in.
...somehow. 
There's something else too.
Secrets.
Video lock.
You got thirty minutes.
It's after five...
Rangers.
Go.
Geneva just pulled the plug.
Hit it...
...now!
No sign of 'em...
Major, we've gotta seal that tunnel!  Major!
...tight!
Colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy?

What's going on, colonel?
 ...that tunnel.
Is Elvis out?
That little geek is my...
...son.
And where are you going?
Well, I've got Dr. Long's body down at the coroner's office.
...-five.
Who's your suspect?
A man named Tim Ma-...
...-son.
Mason?  No, he's a soda-jerk drifter, a hamburger flipper.
Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?
Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?

Hey, doc.  Might wanna...
...try this one out some-...
...-time. 
Excellent.
...like a fish.
 No, that's not possible, Mason.  The trout... 
...is a perfect hunter.
He's brains without ambition...
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
...back...
...and that power...
...-to a simple thing like...
...fishin'.

Mason.
Shit!  Oh, shit. 
Call an ambulance.
The compound has to be kept cold...
 ...or it'll ignite. 
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
And what if it does?
You're the only one I can trust.
...-m-means, Mason.  
Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
And only then does our noble friend realize...
...that the prey can bite back.
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
Well, your prediction was on the nose.
 I don't know.  Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
 ...miles. 
...you, Mason?
What?  Say again, Ma-...
We've got the real thing!
Where are you now...
...Mason?
...tunnel!
Mason.  Mason!
There's a vent shaft leading straight up.
So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
Do you recognize this young man?
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
...-lem?
...you answer mine.
Got that?
So you don't remember...
...seriously.
...public drunkenness....
Shut your mouth until I tell you...
Let me see your...
...hands!
I said let me see your hands now!
You redneck idiot, do you have...

 Listen, Pappas...
...on the other end of this phone.
...side!
...tunnel now!
Just go check the temperature.
Don't move!
What the hell was that?
The Army, sealin' us in.
  All right.
I'll lead 'em out.
 
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
All right, go.
Okay, doc.
Get in 



Gimme this god-...
...-damn phone.
 Talk to me.


Oh.
Do it now.
It's too late, Mason. I've...
...gotta seal it.
Negative.  Negative.
 There's ammo fire from Brynner's vehicle.
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
Look at that.
'Course you do, Jake.
I'll settle for L.A. County.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
Then these are all new owners?
If that's what it says.
Can I check one of these volumes out?
Well, then, how about a ruler?
Sir?
How did she get that idea?
Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
Tell me. What do the police say?
They're calling it an accident.
Who's the investigating officer?
Oh yes.
Where from?
We worked in Chinatown together.
Very.
None.
That's too bad.
His girlfriend?
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
No. She's probably scared to death.
No.
My daughter.
Avocado groves?
I've got her.
Is she all right?
She's fine.
Where is she?
What does this mean?
How much are you worth?
I have no idea. How much do you want?
You've got her? Where?
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
Of course I do. Where are you?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
What are you talking about?
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
What's that, Curly?
Call me Jake. How is everything?
Sure thing.
In the garage.
Off the alley.
Could you drive me somewhere?
Sure, as soon as we eat.
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
I'll just tell my wife.
Plus what I owe you?
You sure this is okay?
That's just lovely.
Where did you get this material?
The apple core club.
Hello, Jake.
Summer colds are the worst.
Thanks, Lou.
How'd you get past the guards?
You've done well by yourself.
Since when?
Looking for someone.
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
Oh yes.
I'd like to talk to him.
No.
Or her name?
I don't want it anymore.
No?
No. It was an accident.
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
What are you doing here?
Didn't you call?
I don't.
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
What are you talking about?
It's too late.
Too late for what?
I know what he says.
Matter of fact I do.
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
That's it?
Yeah.
Well, let's go.
You never learn, do you, Gittes?
I guess not.
Give you three minutes.
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
A complete surprise?
A private investigator?
Mr. Gittes.
Would you like something to drink?
What are you having?
Iced tea.
What?
Mrs. Mulwray?
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
What do you mean?
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
No. I went riding rather early.
I'll stop by.
Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
...Just a minute...
You left your keys in the ignition.
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
How did you find out?
My husband.
Did you have affairs?
Mr. Gittes.
Is there anything else you want to know?
I can't tell you.
You mean you don't know where you were?
I mean I can't tell you.
K... Cross.
That your maiden name?
Yes... why?
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Another satisfied client?
Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
You sure shout that?
That dam is a con job.
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
We got it. We got it, baby.
I'll stay.
Maid's night off?
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
I gave everybody the night off.
Easy, it's an innocent question.
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
When was the last time?
It was in Chinatown.
What were you doing there?
Working for the District Attorney.
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
You can't always tell what's going on there.
What's wrong?
Your eye.
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
...A flaw...
Where?
Just... I have to.
The Albacore Club.
I know.
I saw him.
You saw my fa... father? When?
This morning.
You didn't tell me.
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
It's possible.
I am not!
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
Aren't you coming back with me?
Did you get some sleep?
Where's the girl?
Upstairs. Why?
What did you do that for?
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
Katherine.
Katherine?... Katherine who?
I said the truth!
I said I want the truth.
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
I have to go home and get my things.
I'll take care of it.
Where can we go?
How do you know?
Let me handle that.
I'm all right.
Walsh here?
But, Mr. Gittes.
Sophie.
Sophie.
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
I think I got something.
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
The obituary column?
You'll find one of those people.
Yeah, Sophie.
A Miss Sessions calling.
Who?
Ida Sessions.
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
There's just one question.
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
And Mulwray isn't?
He never even kids about it.
I'm sorry, I --
I never was.
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
I said, the northwest valley.
Mr. Gittes?
Yes?
Do you know me?
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Have we ever met?
Well, no.
Never?
Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
The water.
What about the water?
When it comes.
Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
That's a long fall.
Yeah.
The L.A. River?
It's bone dry, Morty.
Gittes?... Gittes?
Yeah?... I do?
No, really?
I'm afraid so.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
...Yes of course.
All right, what's your husband's first name?
No problem with me on the Job.
Mr. Mulwray, please.
He's not in, Mr.?
May I ask what this is regarding?
Since lunch.
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
He owned the water department?
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
Apple core?
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.
No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
So he says you sent them?
Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
That right?... She used to be some looker.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
Course, she settled down nicely.
Well, you never know, do you?
That's for sure.
Why'd she run away?
You understand which side the gelatin's on?
Will they really find work in Germany?
Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
Now what can you see?
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult.
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
You weren't expecting me?
You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. .
Did you ever see her again? 
You understand now? You see it clearly?
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
Hi, Elena!
Hi. Why are you running?
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
Father, I have sinned...
We'll talk about that later.
I don't care. I'll wait.
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
My husband...you know him.
No...
Then where's the money?
Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
Mr. Kane -
Go on!
I didn't see that.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
I can't take shorthand.
This is all figured at three cents a copy.
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
Go in and ask him to hurry.
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
Enthusiastic?
Yes, very!  Naturally.
Who else you been to see?
You know why?  She was so -
Sure, sure.
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.
Wasted?
Sixty-two thousand -
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Do you, Mr. Leland?
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.
Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter.
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
My little sanctum is at your disposal. But I don't think I understand -
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
And the notice?
Yes - Mr. Kane.
Is it good?
No, Mr. Kane.
That's Leland, isn't it?
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Has he said when he'll finish?
We haven't heard from him.
Hello, Brad -
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -
Almost two to one -
Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here.
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
It can wait.
What's this all about, Emily?  I've had a very tiring day and -
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
Oh yes, there is.
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
Get out, both of you!
Ow!
What's the matter with you?
Toothache.
Oh!
I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
Where's the soap?
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
Where's the towel?
On the chiffonier.  Here.
No.  But you're close.
How old did you say you were?
Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
I work at Seligman's.
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
Would you sing for me?
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Charlie!  I said, what time is it?
I mean in New York.
Half past eleven.
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
Susan, it seems to me -
Don't tell me you're sorry.
I'm not sorry.
I'm going to leave you.
No, you're not.
I won't let you go.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Get Dr. Corey.
Close the door, Raymond.
Yes, sir. 
Raymond - 
Can't say, sir.
Oh, yes, sir.
Do you know what that is?
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
Tired?
It's been a tough day.
Charlie -
Charlie -
Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
First of all - 
What's wrong, Brad?
I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
All right.
Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
Oh, yes, the bonus.
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
Well, let's hope it's all for the best.
Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid needs is a good thrashing!
What's this?
It's a letter from her lawyers.
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
Rawlston is my boss.
Brief marriage!  Ten years! 
Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
Thompson!
That's the whole works, right up to date.
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
Yes and no.
You can go on asking questions if you want to.
Millions - if anybody wants it.
The banks are out of luck, eh?
Who told you you could sit down here?
I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
How did you meet him?
What did you get?
Right away.  Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
Am I sure?
Are you sure?
Am I sure about what?
Are you serious?
How long have you been smoking?
I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am I right?
You're shittin' me.
Pack of cigarettes.  What's that?
Thanks. Have a good one.
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
I take it she likes the guy.
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
You can hold me down.
Dick.
Exactly.
God, isn't he great?
No, this is great.
Can I use the bathroom?
There's no light back there.
Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
I was here the whole time.
Nobody! I swear!
When did you get back?
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
Train. It took eight hours.
You saw it?
Very dramatic, I thought.
And you said yes?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
Sang? His name is a past tense?
I just told you.
There's more, isn't there?
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
But can we date?
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
You're serious. You want to date again.
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
Let me take you out tonight.
You mean, on a date?
Sang.
Sang.
He's not invited.
So what are you saying?
You're such an asshole.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
I left like an hour ago.
It wasn't me.
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
Stop this. This isn't funny.
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
Are you sure somebody was back there?
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
We did.
Then who operated the store?
Nobody. It was closed.
Yeah.
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
If you can just wait a few more minutes.
I can pass!
Who are you to make assessments?
Are you open?
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
Pack of cigarettes.
Cute cat. What's his name.
You open?
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.
You only brought one ball?!
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
Why are the shutters closed?
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
Bunch of savages in this town.
What time do you have to stay till?
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
What smells like shoe polish?
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
You called Caitlin again?
She called me.
Eight and a half.
She called you Brad?
That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
Oh, my God.
Great story, isn't it?
Your mother.
Allan Harris.
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
I'm talking to myself here.
Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
All four?
You know what I just watched?
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
Empire.
What's that?
All right, Vader's boss...
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
Wait.
Perfect dozen.
Each egg has to be perfect.
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.
Let's hear it.
The milkmaids.
No.
Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
Vermont?
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
FUCK!
Why'd you apologize?
You know what pisses me off the most?
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
I'm going to miss the game.
Don't yell at me, pal.
Sorry.
See? There you go again.
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
At least we're stuck here together.
Design major.
Are you gonna lock the store?
I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
We're not playing in the street.
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
You know what Sanford told me? 
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
Julie Dwyer died.
How? When?
You've had sex with a dead person.
I'm gonna go to her wake.
No, you're not.
Why not?
It's today.
Shit. What about tomorrow?
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
You hate people.
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
If you go, I go.
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
I'm going with you.
She was pretty young, hunhh?
Twenty-two; same as us.
An embolism in a pool.
An embarrassing way to die.
How'd he die?
Broke his neck.
Shut the hell up.
Bible truth.
Stop it.
I swear.
No!
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
His dick was in his mouth?
Balls resting on his lips.
I could never reach.
Reach what?
You know.
I can't fucking believe you!!
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
Let me borrow your car.
I don't want to talk to you.
Fine. Just lend me your car.
Why should I loan you my car?
I want to rent a movie.
What's that for?
Let me borrow your car.
May I be blunt with you?
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
Please, get the hell out of here.
Get to work.
And this is what you rented?
I like to expand my horizons.
No way!
Five hundred dollars.
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
I don't; you did.
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
Then how come you got the fine?
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
Because I'm happy.
You're happy?
I'm happy.
You're happy to get a fine?
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
Now I know you're lying.
I'm not. She just left.
You're kidding.
I'm not.
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Watch the store while I go home and change.
What happened to title dictates behavior?
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
You just fucked a total stranger?
Around three or something.
This life.
This life?
Why do I have this life?
You should shit or get off the pot.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
It's the same thing with Veronica.
Who're you kidding? You can so.
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
Why do you say that?
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
How do you figure?
To talk to you.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
It's not like I'm miles away.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
You need a ride?
Do you work tomorrow?
Helluva day.
Get the fuck outta here already.
Are you open?
Yes.
Just the paper.
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
He's got those love handles.
Do I know you?
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
I'm her sister.
They are not.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
I am not.
How much can you bench?
Did you say Caitlin Bree?
How do you know that?
No, she's getting married.
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
Are there any balls down there?!
I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
We were going to start again, I think.
I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
You calling me a liar?
Be careful.
And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
No, he got hit by a bus.
Oh... Can I help you?
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
At least they weren't lit.
I hate this fucking place.
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
Somebody jammed the locks with gum.
You're kidding.
Bunch of savages in this town.
You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
What were you doing?
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
What? What is that?
You're trusting.
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
Ooh! Can we?!
Really?
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
Typically male point of view.
And I actually date you?
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
How many?
How many what?
How many girls have you slept with?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
What the hell was that for?
You're a pig.
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
Three.
Three?
You've only had sex with three different people?
Who?
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
Shit! Why are we getting up?
He requested this?
He gets off on it.
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Why do you say that?
Like you said-she snowballed him.
Yeah, right.
You sucked that guy's dick?
That's because I never had sex with him!
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
Please calm down.
How many?
How many dicks have you sucked?!
Let it go...
Well...?
Something like thirty-six.
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Um. Thirty-seven.
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
I'm going to class.
No, but you sucked enough dick!
I feel sick.
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
Thank you for being rational.
Thank you for the lasagne.
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
Veronica, I love you...
You hold the counter and I'll pull.
I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
You open?
Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
Can I have your name please?
Here you go.
What's this?
I didn't do that!
You said you were here all day?
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
He's your cousin?
No way!
What did he say?
That doesn't sound metal.
I do about three-fifty, four.
No way!
Feel that.
Sure. How about the beach?
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
No, I wasn't.
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
You'll be missed.
That's the price, my brother.
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
How long you gonna be here?
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
You're gonna be at John K's party?
I'm not sad.
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
I know. I've been here since eleven.
Which one?
Twenty bucks?
Twenty bucks.
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
I will. Take it easy.
Gabe!  Hey, man!  Gabe!  It's Gabe!
Work!  Don't say that word, man.
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
That woulda been cool.
Answer the man.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
Jessie, Hal, come in...please report.  Over.
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.
So, what do you see?
Surprise me.
What usually eats a banana?
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
Copy.  Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
Where are you, Walker?
The money!
Glad you could drop in.
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
What the hell are you doing here?!
There wasn't time for anything else.
We'll never know, will we?
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
What are we going to do?
I'm going with you.
Not on that leg.
Room service...Hi, Sarah.
She's tough.
There you go.
Four...five...
Nice and easy...
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
Help me!  I don't want to die!
Patience my love, patience.
Gabe?  Gabe, where are you?
I know...
I don't expect you to understand.
I don't understand?
Why are you yelling?
Excuse me?
Why are you yelling?
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
Which could maybe what?
Maybe lead to a flare up...
A flare up...
Listen to you...  The old "mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation routine, huh?
From one professional to another, of course.
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
Gabe!?
You got to go back now!
I can't believe you just said that.
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
Remember the first time we came up here?
Of course I do.
It was great.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
Gabe...your arm?
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
We have to get through to the other side.  You up for it?
A simple yes or no would have done.
Want me to lead?
Nice view, huh?
Gabe!  Are you alright?
Can you see light?
No luck?
She's a lyin' bitch!!
Pull it apart!
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
Never
Never, what?!
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Frank!  No, Frank!  Frank!
Don't let me fall!
We were going together before I ever let go of you.
Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
We don't have time to argue about it!
Take the rope.
I won't do it.  No way.
Wrap it around that rock twice.
What about you?!
There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
Never could save a thing.
Where's the helicopter?
Talk.  No tricks, no codes, no messages.  You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
It's up there, on the Tower.
He never hurt anybody.
Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
Yeah...
What's your names?
Tucker and Walker.
On top of the peak.
Then where the fuck is!
Go after her.
Who's going with you?
You're looking at him.
Oh, my God!
Right.
What the hell are you doing--
Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
Why?  What are you going to do?!
Don't use my name!
Ask the questions.
Where's the third one, Travers?
I don't trust him.
Bring down the money or your friend's dead!
Man against nature, right Travers.
This way.
This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
You got what we need?
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
Rich...
I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
Been punished, yeah?
Good evening, sir.
Of course. Food alright?
Great, sir. Great.
Won't you join me, sir?
No, my health doesn't allow it.
Thank you, sir.
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
Phoned some friends, sir?
Help you.
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
So this is the young man?
How do you do, sir?
Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
Much better, thank you, sir.
What would you like to know, sir?
Well, shall we get down to it?
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I swear it.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
Who said that?
What crime did you commit.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
Good evening, my boy.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
Keeping fit then?
Fine, fine.
Well, how are you then?
Well - I'm back.
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
No, brother. What d'you want?
I'm gonna be sick.
I wanna be sick.
You wanna be sick?
Alexander de Large, sir.
Crime?
C of E, sir.
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
Brown hair, is it?
Fair hair, sir.
Blue eyes?
Are you an Epileptic?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Crabs?
No, sir.
Lice?
No, sir.
Through there for a bath.
You're absolutely right, sir.
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
How're you feeling this morning?
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
You mean like going to the pictures?
Yes!!!
You've heard Beethoven before?
How are you feeling today?
Fine. Fine.
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
I haven't seen you before.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
Yes.
I was quite enjoying that.
Good. I'm glad
And when do I get out of here then?
You're keen on music?
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
Father, I have tried, have I not?
You have, my son.
Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
One pair of trousers - blue pinstriped.
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Carry on, Chief.
Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?
Hullo, son, how are you?
How many to a cell?
Shall we go to my office?
What?
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
But Bowery's fine, if that's what you want.
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
The ride is free.
No.  I got lucky with the lights.
Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
Like what?
Big case?
Most of the time.
You need a vacation.
How often you go?
Annie...it's Max.
Max...
Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...
...he's two floors below you.
In my office?
Where are you, what floor?
Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
This your current address?
You dizzy?  You want to sit down?
I'm...fine.  Fine.
You're kidding me.
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.
No.
Oh, my, yes.
You know Dmitri?
How do I know you'll keep your word?
It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
I'm sorry.
Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?
I picked up a tail.
Vincent.  Do not cross me.
What are you gonna do?
You guys been holding hands?
So?  It was a random thing.
I never bought that.
Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.
What if they're wrong?
Not our call, Phil.
...if they're wrong?!
Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.
Quite an achievement...
What's your name?
Try?
Hi, Ma.
I've been calling and calling.
What am I gonna do with flowers?
What's he sayin'?
I'm standing right here.
I came to see you, you look fine.  We gotta go.
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!
He's not paying you one cent!
I was just tryin' to...to...
You hassling my driver again?
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
He'll keep calling.
Hello?
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
You on some kind of work plan?
You mean like benefits?
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
It's not that kind of job.
Me, specifically?
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
Max.
You cool, Max?  Say "I'm cool."
You're cool.
Good.  Help me out here.
I don't think I can do this.
Got it?
His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
Max.
You listening to me?
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
What about that?
I tried it.
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
Try some deep breathing.
What are you doing?
It's a mess.
58th and Central.  You know it?
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
Are you breathing?
Music.
I didn't throw him, he fell.
What'd he do to you?
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
Get rid of 'em.
I can't believe this.
I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them.
That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant...
Who's that?
It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
So what?
I need the job.
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
Another collateral.
What?
Collateral damage.
Vincent?
Yes, Max?
I'm...what?  Sorry?
Jazz.  Music.
Let him go, Vincent.
Let's go.
No.
What you mean, no?
Max?  What are you doing?
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
Show up for what?
She's in the hospital.
You go every night?
Mom, Vincent's not interested.
You take one more step, I'll kill her.
What the fuck was <u>that?</u>
Limos, huh?
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
What, no insurance?
Doesn't cover everything.
The man who hired me for this contract.
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
Why?
In case he asks.
You get benefits?
No.
Washington and Holt.  Dance club called "Fever." Know it?
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
Would you have called her?
You had to kill Heller?!
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
No, not just that.
Yeah, that.
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
Some living.
Head towards Union Station.
One more.
And you believe me...?
Then what are you?
What happened to you?
Slow down!
Well.  That was brilliant.
Max?
They said send you downstairs.
The sound of love.
I never told her.
Why the hell not?
Are you crazy?!
The guy came right at us!
I was only going one way.
Drop me off here!
Look, I'm sorry --
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
Mississippi?
Saved you last night's, too.
Do you still ride?
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
You going to warn him?
I can't promise you anything.
You think I'm crazy.
I bit the bastard's nose off.
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
What's the charge?
Just relax.
Switch the charts.
What is?
People do have heart attacks.
For what?
You saved my life.
He says a dog bit his nose.
Arf... You gotta help me.
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Them who?
Flat, wraparound headlights?
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
That's it?
You okay?
If my universe had a hub...
I've been reading up on it.
Pretty scary, huh?
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
What are you doing?
Uh huh.
Has this happened to you before?
Never, but I've been practicing.
So what's the question?
Is this your dad?
That was him.
Is he dead?
Please put it down.
How'd he die?
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
Murdered?
Okay, I will.
If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
You look great.
We're going to Queens?
Now what?
Where are we going, Jerry?
Connecticut.
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
Liza?
Did you kill him?
Is that what they told you?
He gave it to me.
I don't understand.
Where were you the day he died?
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
I believe you.
They'll trace it.
Blue moon... Blue moon...
Blue moon...
Without a song in my heart.
Liza?
Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?
They changed Franklin's portrait.
I love you, too.
Do I know you?
I'm a very patient man.
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
Liza Sutton is dead.
Thank you.
I'm not sure what you mean.
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
You made your decision yet?
I'll do it.  On one condition.  I want to make sure she's okay.
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
I don't know...
A dog bit it.
And you have no idea where he lives?
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
And what did I say?
<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
I'm still listening.
Where'd you get it?
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
It's okay.  I'm game.
So, you doing anything tonight?
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
Working.
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
Liza, settle a bet for us.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
Go ahead, Miss Sutton.
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
Which way did he go?
Agent Lowry.
Wasn't my idea.
Can I talk to you a second?
Do you believe me?
Yeah, I do.
I want to believe you, too.
Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
Where do you think Jerry is?
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
What do you suggest?
That you come with me.
There's no plug to pull.
Yes, sir.
He died...  ... in 1972.
Dr. Arroway --
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
What in the hell...?
Now I remember why I went into theoretical work.  Kent.
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
Pepsi?  Tequila?
Peter sends his regards.
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
No doubt.
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
Throw a gray scale on it; standard interpolation.
What is it?  What's happened?
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
David --
Ellie.
Do you have a minute -- ?
Actually I'm running late --
You aren't staying?
This... seemed best.
What would you have me say, David?
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
There's no way of knowing.  Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never.
And?
No primer.
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
That can't be right; it's only twenty-six light years away.
Here, right around Centaurus A.
Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up the starfield signal origin.
Can't we get rid of them?
-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
And a hundred mile airspace.
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
Please answer the question, Doctor.
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Talk to him.
But what do I say?
Could we hear to the moon?
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
You're not real.  None of this is.
Can you show me?
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years.
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
Am I one... or many?
So.  What happens now?
Now... you go home.
It's time to go home now.
A page-break signal.  A period.
It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.
You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
Hokkaido Island.
The systems integration site.
Ellie.  Arroway.
Sounds like a Russian general.
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
Actually --
We could be together again --
-- I'm moving to Washington.
Ellie --
Ellie.
It's good to see you, Ellie.
Someone tell me this is really happening.
It's really happening.
That you, Valerian?
Like it or not.
Ellie -- are you okay?
Wait -- hold on a minute --
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
What day?
Champagne please.
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
Did you love him?
Yes.  Very much.
So.  Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
Some of my best friends are scientists.
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
Maybe you're creating a monster.
I don't think so.
It's getting late...
So.  The final countdown.
The final countdown.
What...?
I'm sorry.
Ellie, what is it?
I'm sorry -- I can't --
What?
I can't do this --
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
Hi.
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
I'm not sure it's come to that.
They don't believe me.
Oh my God...
Git your shovel and git to work.
Git movin', I said.
But I made this arrangement --
You don't take another man's place, boy.
Yeah, well, Arletta, you done your best. What I done with myself is my problem.
Yeah.
What are you doin' here?
Here, Mom.
What went wrong?
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
I'm leavin' the place to John.
Gotta go, Arletta.
A salesman! Cool Hand Luke a salesman?
Comin' out here, Boss?
Then how come it ain't done yet?
I don't know, Boss.
What's all this dirt in the yard?
Please! Please!
You got your mind right, Luke?
Go git it, Luke.
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Borrowin' or payin' back?
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
So then you just call him.
But there's still daylight left.
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
What happened? How far did you get?
Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...
Lemme see it!
Dragline, lemme look at the picture.
That's my baby.
Somebody say somethin'?
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Well, whatta we got here?
Whatta you so happy about?
Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard road finally got to Mister Lucas War Hero.
Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
Whatta you mean, forget it?
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
Where'd the road go?
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
Sure do... that's why we didn't bet with the Navy.
But, Luke...
Take it easy, Drag.
Luke. Where you goin?
Like I always do?
Dragline gives out the names here. You'll get yours when he figures you out.
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
You just said he could eat anything.
Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
Oh Lord!
That fool. That damn fool.
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
Man, it's so hot.
Cuter again.
Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
Kick a buck.
Back a buck.
Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.
You think you've been working hard. This muther'll break your back.
He'll never make it.
He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.
No. No chains either.
I hate this...
Now look what you did.
It's good medicine.
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
Oh God.  I'm really crazy.
When was the last time you washed your hair?
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
The moon is up, my night to howl. Will you be okay?
You bastard!
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
What pattern was that?
What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
The door was already open...
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
She's supposed to have it.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
Who is this?
I think this is number three...
Is he out?
If he's not out, why are they here?
Because of your phone calls.
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
Is it an ongoing case?
How do you know that?
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
We've got another one.
That's no surprise.
But it's a different m.o.
I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
That computer's wired into INTERNET.
I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest of it?
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
Are you always so bold?
Tell me what to do!
Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!
The lock...
It's a woman shot in a car?
Yes.  I have to go...
Don't hang up!
Is there a phone booth there?
They all have one...
Open the door.  Please.
He was in my apartment!
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
Who came in after you?
What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
Because it's your job, that's all.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
Working late.  You're a damn fool.
It's none of my business anymore...
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
Well, you outranked <u>me</u>, Nikko.
I heard. Good police work.
Just horseshit luck.
Snotty neurotic bitch...
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
Honest to God, Ruben!
You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...
Absolutely.
What about her arms?
Look at her legs.
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...
I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
You messed with the scene.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
How about I put Nikko on it?
Sergeant?
What the hell you need her for?
You got a suspect...
How'd you get in on the deal?
Give me Ruben back...
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
There, that's better.
And her husband? What was he?
Where's the car?
Outside in the visitors, car park.
It's about time.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
It does.
Do you find him attractive?
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
No. But when he's in that car...
I thought that was you, up there.
One of your suitors?
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
I'd like to go back. James...
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
You haven't told me where we're going.
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
So - why the airport?
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
Can you drive?
What does he want from you?
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
I did this already.
I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
Patient.
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
The question, Letty, is how are you feeling?
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
It was just a little going-away gesture.
What's up with you?
Just go ahead and tell us.
She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
And the party?
Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
What do you think of this one?
Things have been kind of stressful lately.
Yeah, everything's under control.
What about the engagement party?
What about this one?
You look beautiful.
Really?
Fuck me.
What's all the dreck?
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
Do we have to talk wedding details?
What's his name, Letty?
You did the right thing.
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Will you get time off to do that?
Are you sure, Dear?
My goodness. A wedding.      My goodness.
Tell us every detail.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
Yes.
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
I'll see you soon.
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
I haven't had a crush since I was
I'm only looking out for you.
Must you walk so quickly?
Honestly, Letty.
Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?
Don't be fresh.
Letty, you should be in bed.
Green spot.
To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
You can only do what feels best to you now.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
Chair, cup and ball.
By color.
A while, I guess.
Hey there. They're showing "Groundhog Day" if you...
You took bets on my diagnosis?
It's no big deal.   We all compare.
Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
What are you looking to read?
But you're checking it out.
John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
He asked me to marry him.
Very romantic setting.
Guess which hand.
Enough with the abracadabra.
Guess.
Really, this isn't funny.
For a price.
Good God.
We're supposed to be asleep.
We'll get caught.
Don't be ridiculous.
A daisy for the lady.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
Thanks.    Where've you been all day?
I'm not allowed to see you anymore.
Wow.    I'm bad news.
Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.
I wish I could have seen that.
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
Tell the doctor.
Then it's over.
It's a good thing my family loves you.
Do you?
I do.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
Well?
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
So there were no problems?
Not a one.
Yeah.
I better make a list.
Wow.
You've got to see the kitchen first.
I love your apartment.
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
Hey.
Michael.
Not yet.
Good luck.
This must be Beast.
Sounds grim.
Who ever said sanity was fun?
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
I think I should go home.
Are you OK?
Four interviews. Four no-gos.
The restaurant, too?
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
How may I help you?
Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
What is it? Are you OK?
Always the drugs.
I saw you talking to my Mom.
Silly?   Silly am I?
Michael, take it easy.
Silly, silly, silly.
Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.
I guess we need to talk.
I guess so.
I sure know what that feels like.
And all the plans we have.
Well then why'd it happen?
I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
What are we going to do?
I love you so much.
Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
I guess I should go now.
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
Can I put these here for tonight?
Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter.
My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
You don't have a fever.
I don't feel like going to work today.
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
Sure. Why?
I'm going to the store.
It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
Are you all right?
That's a big question.
I hope it wasn't something I did.
Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?
No.
Especially this last year.
Especially now.
I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
No, you've done a perfect job.
No, no.
So will you?
What's so urgent?   You've got me worried.
I've met someone else.
Who?
It doesn't matter who.
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
Getting back.
I heard about your friend.
I think I've heard this speech before.
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
What does that mean?
How's it look?
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa.
Agent Hadley.
Do you know who this is?
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Zero.   That's all I know.
Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
Too many people know about my involvement in this.
Not today.   Where are your friends?
They left about a half hour ago.
Where did they go?
Hey man, you can't do that!
Hello?
It's Elvis...
Who?
It's me...
You're there now?
My number's going to show up on his bill!
You've already robbed the safe?
Hello?
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
Good.   I'm good.
-- Super what?
Okay.   How much?
I'm not here to negotiate.
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
They're gonna be what?
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
I guess we're going to find out.
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
Half the tapes.
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
Thank you.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
Yeah.   We just go home.
Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
Because you're the closest.
Why is everything an argument with you?
Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
Hopefully no one.
I just want you there in case there's trouble.
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
I'm going to kill him myself!
Turn on the flashlight.
Do they come with batteries?
You didn't buy batteries?
I thought they came with batteries.
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
No.
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
Good idea.
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
All right, knock it off.
Hadley --
It's not your fault, Daniel.
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
Anybody hungry?
What'd you get?
I will.
Did you have to use that much explosive?
What do you want now?
Guns.   Can you get them?
Man, I can get anything.
Why haven't you turned us in?
How much?
A thousand dollars?
Yeah?
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
They were all French guys.
Yeah, French guys from France.
Everything.
Everything.
Just find them!
What hotel?
I don't know.     I didn't look.
I was told to take what we have and go.
They don't have a wine list.
What about transportation?
No, I didn't.
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
They don't serve wine here.
This kind.
We've got to get out of here.
Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
I'll drive.
I knew I should have driven.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
I'm not going to leave you.
What the hell is he talking about?
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
No.   How much?
Today's your lucky day, Sami.
You lived there. You know the city.
-- I want to be Elvis.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
Mr. Taylor?
It's good.
No.
Give it to me, Sami.
Get in the car.
What happened?
Anybody know about that car outside?
Yeah.   It's mine.
Fuck you, grease-ball!
Mr. Zammito?
I don't know what you're talking about.
How?
I am Raymond.     Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
How are we going to do that?
He speaks about himself in the third person?
I think we went the wrong way.
Holy shit.
The money isn't here.
Glenmorangie.
Algeria.
I can't even hear myself think.
What does arresting us get them?
And how do we do that?
When do we go?
You ever hear of jet lag?
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
Did she break your heart?
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
Can't sleep?
Who are you waiting for?
Why?
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
What's this?
Okay.    Okay.
You're back!
How's the arm?  Still sore?
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
She's crazy.  You should have killed her.
I didn't have the heart.
Who are you?
I don't care about your sword.
Yes.
Where's your master?
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
On guard!
Why do you want to teach me?
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
I'm just playing around.
Tell me, who is your master?
I'll never live as a thief!
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
I owe you nothing.
Hello.  What is your name?
Don't bother.
You don't seem to understand.
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
Put them down.
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
This spells trouble.
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
You're too young to understand.
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
I've missed you.
How so?
You're doing calligraphy?
You write gracefully.  Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
Here you must be in proper attire.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
Come and get it if you can.
Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.
Not another lecture!  On guard!
Let's end this here.
What do you want?
Give it back!
Lo?
Let's stop a moment.
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
Give me back my comb.
I don't take orders from anyone.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
Let them look.
Go.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Mu Bai...It's been too long.
Good.  And how are you?
I left the training early.
Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
The Green Destiny Sword?  You're giving it to Sir Te?
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu.
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
Have you questioned him yet?
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
Then, why did you come?
I knew she would intrigue you.
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
What about you?
Shu Lien...
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
They're gone.
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
And you're gonna tell me who.
Talent. Hi.
Care for a hot dog?
You buying?
No onions though, okay?
No onions?
Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file?
Well, hello there...chocolate,
Don't thank me.
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
My name.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
Thank you.  For giving a damn.
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
It's only a flesh wound.
They couldn't do anything for me.
How 'bout the morgue?
Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to --  Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?
At least it finally stopped raining.
Fun -- look at that guy...
Who?
Mister Funboy.
I can pick out a tune now and again.
Do you feel okay.
You gotta go now, I bet.
What's going on...?
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
In a better place.  I hope.
I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
What's goin' on, Elly?
I went to see a friend of mine.
Well, how's your friend?
Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
Mom tried to cook.
I don't know you.
Holy shit... you're dead, man...
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
Do you know what you destroyed?
Cute nickname, don't you think?
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
Top Dollar.
I wish to possess what you have now.
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
What the hell are you?
Shelly?
Get it?
Glad to see you're finally with the program.
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Shut up.
Don't waste my time.
Blow yourself, bigmouth.
Coupla more rings... 24k.
18k.  Crap.
...necklace... pearls...
Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
We've got company.
No shooting.
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
Have we met?
Did you know Sebastian well?
Are you okay?
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
Excuse me?
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
I have his journal.
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
You promise not to say anything?
On my mother's life.
Junior.
Got a boyfriend back home?
No.
You a lesbo?
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
The Fountainhead.
Great book.
Romantic? He rapes her.
That's a matter of opinion.
Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
I sincerely doubt it.
How's the water?
I never said that.
Why not?
Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
You're naked.
Need a lift?
No thank you.
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
You don't even know me.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
Who?
That's none of your business.
How about tonight?
I'm busy.
Doing what?
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
How was your date?
Wait, don't hang up.
Okay?
What are you doing?
What are you reading?
Of Human Bondage.
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
Alone again.  What are you up to today?
I'm doing some volunteer work.
Need any company?
Oh please.
"I actually feel good about myself?"
I do not.
No.
Am I bothering you?
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
You know what? I don't take it back.
Because I'm in love with you.
That's not fair.
You really want to know?
I just came to say goodbye.
I think that's for the best.
Hi.
Hi.
Would you like a tour?
This isn't working out for me anymore.
What are you saying?
Why aren't you understanding?
But you knew this was important to me.
Ben Schwarz.
Schwarz. Jewish?
German.
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
Greg McConnell.
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
I don't think that bothered him.
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
Oh, I suck. I suck.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Where did you find those?
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
Are you for real?
Okay.
What are you saying?
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
No.
Well do you like him?
Okay.
Who is it?
Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.
Something awful happened last night.
What do you mean?!
I... I don't think you want to know.
Cecile, you have to tell me.
No.
What do I do then?
Cecile, you had an orgasm.
But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it?
It's like a secret society.
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
What year are you in?
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
But I thought high school is only four years.
Excellent.
You think he'll like it?
What are you doing?
Just taking your photo.
I'm sorry that was out of line.
I was just kidding.
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
And then I can go home?
Just a kiss, right?
Want to join me?
Am I suppose to be this sore?
Is it me?
Where are you going?
I'm taking a shower.
Need any company?
No.
Want a blow job?
Good night Cecile.
I do.
It works a little.
My daughter, Rachel.
Good luck, Sebastian.
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Hi, mom.
Who told you?
Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
Nudie pictures, what do you think?
Oh baby... oh baby...
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
And you think she bought it?
I'm pretty sure she did.
Pretty sure or sure sure?
She bought it.
Is she with you?
Who is this?
No.
Pleased to meet you.
Hello.
Ronald?
Yeah?
Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
Care to make a wager on that?
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
Be more specific.
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
You can put it anywhere.
Fuck her yet?
I'm working on it.
Loser.
Call me later.
You would not believe what--
I'm at your service.
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
Moving along quite well.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Who are you calling?
Yippy.
Who are you spying on?
That her?
Shut up.
What's your problem?
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
Morning!
So? How'd it go last night?
She shot you down.
Bad time?
You didn't?
Tell me all the details.
It was... Fantastic.
Excuse me?
I'm not in the mood.
And that's why you're leaving?
It clearly is why.
I want to fuck.
Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
Why so nervous?
I've never done this before.
How have you dumped girls in the past?
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
I thought we should celebrate.
Well done.
In any event, you still owe me my reward.
Get off me!
Will you calm down?
Get out? We had an arrangement.
I think you have your answer.
I got your message and came as quick as I could.
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
Not at all. What's wrong?
It's Cecile.
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
I can't thank you enough.
Let me get that for you.
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
It's desperate that I talk to her.
I've already told you, she's not home.
What do you want?
I need to talk to Annette.
She's not here.
Do you know where she is?
Do you know when she'll be back?
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
I'll do that.
It's really important.
Yes, you already did.
Right after we played backgammon.
We played backgammon?
I did?
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
I said, do you want some water?
What time is it?
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
Did she show up?
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
You're a lucky guy.
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
Where the hell do you come off hitting women?
What are you talking about?
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
Did you hit her?
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
Ronald, I'm sorry.
That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
Does she go up to the Farren's often?
What are saying, darling?
Yes, darling.
Did you ever make a wish?
Oh, lots of times.
But where did you get it, Amy?
Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
On the back street  a green house
The Farren house
I got my wish anyway.
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
But it's already come true.
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
She was very pretty.
What's her name?
Irena.
Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
I think I should.  3000W?
Something's haywire,
I'm never unfair.
What is it, Alice?
Ollie.
What?
I haven't had my breakfast.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
I live right here.
Yes, daddy.
Did you mail then?
Where did you mail them?
But wishes don't come true.
What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
They ran away.
Now Amy
And who did the voice belong to?
These are all from me.
Just you wait!
Daddy!
In the garden? Would she be there now?
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
But there's no one here, darling.
Daddy?
What'd you get for Christmas?
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
Who are you?
You called me by my name.
Irena. But who are you?
I'm your friend.
I've wanted a friend.
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
But where is that?
I can not tell you.
Will you be friend for always?
For as long as you'll let me.
Can't you get it, darling?
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
But you must!
Your children?
All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
Merry Christmas, Irena.  I brought you a present.
Merry Christmas.
So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
It's you...Irena...my friend!
You mustn't be afraid.
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
Yes, Amy.
Look at my ring.
That's a fine-looking ring.
About time for you to come home, Amy.
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
Bad luck to see death in the snow.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
Because it can't. It's dead.
But I only came to give back the ring.
Mommy read it to ne.
The Headless Horseman --
What?
Who's Herne the Huntsman?
Hurry, hurry.
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
Mother! You called me by name!
Good night, mother, good night.
Let the child stay.
There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am.
What is it, ma'am?
It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
And Amy mailed them?
I like to see her happy.
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
Waiter! She needs more water.
Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
No.
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
What?
Wow your body's really hot.
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
There was a sale.
I mean where on your body?
A dog at Victoria's Secret?
How's the rest of your health?
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
Nearly four.
Jennifer?
No it's mom.
We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Translation: a total geek.
Anything's better than Mark.
He hasn't said one word to me.
Do you really need these?
Only to see.
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
Or if there's a full moon.
Where are all the mediums?
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
And he was ripped limb from limb?
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
So did you do it?
No, did you fuck him?
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
At least your PMS is over.
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
Rule one: always wear make-up.
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
Give him the tampon test.
What did he say?
Charming Carlton.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
So where's this infamous arm now?
I put it down the garbage disposal.
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
I've been here. What day is it?
Tuesday. Are you okay?
Shit, I guess I missed work.
Frida, Carlton's dead.
Oh no.
Get rid of him!
Holy shit, I don't know.
He's been here all night?
DON'T call the police.
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
Why the fuck would you do that?
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
You expecting someone?
No.
I think I just got my period.
Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
What choice do we have?
So what do I do?
Fall in love.
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
I think George knows.
About Mark? Carlton?
Did I kill a guy named Benito?
Hello?
I know.
You hungry?
Well, whattdaya think?
Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
They say sex is great for cramps.
What?
I really gotta pee.
You should have gone at the restaurant.
I didn't have to pee then.
Oh come on. Knock it off.
Knock what off?
Uh huh. So pee.
What, you got a date or somethin'?
You look different. I mean you look good.
Look what you did!
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
Frida, you know you're it for me.
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
Mark.
The Nielson's?
On your desk.
Script coverage?
On your desk.
Coffee and...
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
Did you change your hair?
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
No.
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
You busted me.
I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
You wanna get some coffee?
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
So what book did you buy?
It's stupid.
My mom used to get PMS too.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
Yeah. Maybe.
Goodnight.
Was there anything in that washer?
Everything okay?
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
No, I got it. It's okay.
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
You didn't say it.
Your breasts feel larger.
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
Go away. I might hurt you.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
Peter I love you too but...
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
I ate a guy last night.
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
You got a dog?
No, I have a cat.
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
It's for you. Frida.
Take some allergy medicine.
Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
How the hell is that your business?
You want her sheets?
See he was cheating from the get go.
I told you she was innocent.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
He means the last that we know of.
Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
And that was 28 days ago today.
I need something to keep me awake.
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Thanks.  Just some pills.
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
Maybe ten minutes...  Thats strange.
What's he doing here?
The other one?
His wife.
Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
They don't speak English...
How will we interrogate them?
Police.  Nobody move.
He tried to kill me!
Doctor!  What brings you here?
Just visiting my patient.
You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Was that for real down there?
Good evening, sir.
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
Its extremely important to my investigation...
Dammit!
Im your new assistant.
I didnt requisition a secretary.
You typed this report?
It seems fine.
How can I submit this?
Why, yes.
Where are we going?
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
People...  after me.
Why are they after you?
Don't know that either.
They didn't have faces.
Can't let you in...  sorry.
They've taken my mind, my memories...
Look!  This is a good one!
What is that door?
Such a joker!  Like your father.
You see it?
Yes.
A book of delusions.  Anything else?
But I...
I see.  The verdict, yes...
I didn't realise...
No.  I, ah...
Then we must call the police.
I see.  Then who is after you?  What sins have you committed?
Dont kill me!
Shut up!
You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
Your name is John White.
Bad dreams?
Yes.
If you like.
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
Known me for long?
I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
I'm nothing then.
You're a liar!
What are you hiding?
What happened to you?
What is it?
How do I get there?  Tell me.
You understand what you'll be doing?
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
Don't say a .
Uh --Mr. Alexander?
Is this dangerous or anything?
No more than the usual.
They barely talk anymore.
Now, remember -- keep it simple.
What's with her?
And we're going away for a holiday.
For a month.
A month.
Right and don't embellish.
I'm not certain about...
Mr. President...
What the hell is this?
The Washington Post.
.. Nothing.
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
Oh... I'm fired?
You're fired.
Fine?
Don't call the Vice President!
... What?
Just don't call him, Alan!
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
I don't give a shit.
Till what?
TilT we figure something out.
Up and around?  Soon?
A condition...
We think so.
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
What about the wife?
Clean.
Nobody's got clean kids.
Uh, let me get back to you...
It's a homeless shelter.
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
No!...  WE didn't anything...
Do we have anything on the budget today?
What are you gonna do?
I'm going to kill him.
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
Don't do this.
What do you mean by that?
Just what you think I mean.
Are you threatening me?
So you want to go swimming?
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
I was gonna do something with Joan.
It's fine.
They could put you in jail.
I don't think so
This is undeclared income.
And who's gonna find out?
The government
I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
That'd be great.
Extend things?
No.
I'm afraid so.
In the car?
In the car.
A teleprompter.
I don't think so.
I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
Fine.
Gimme a quarter.
What?
President vetoes works bill?
Let's call it a night.   I can't take any more.
What do you mean you made it all up?
This is wrong, Alan!
Wrong...
`Dave'?
And it's proving quite effective...
Does it make the cars any better?
What are they?
Fertility beads.
They re not my attack dogs.
What do you mean?
Oh... Hi.
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
... Sometimes they do.
What?
You're not?
Your government needs your help.
Really?
We'd like to hire you.
You got a gun?
You ever use it?
Call Bob and Reed.  Tell them I need them immediately.
I was waiting for that jack.
You mean with you and everything?
`Bleed for your king.'
You're kidding.
Didn't mean to bum you out.
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
Who?
Well...
You sure you don't want a lift back home?
Don't you have anything to say to me?
I care about the homeless.
What's wrong with a magic trick?
Oh... Yeah.
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
Where are you going?
Just souvenirs.  Towels and stuff.
How were you gonna get home?
What?
Are you hungry?
That's a secret.
You have a lot of secrets.
So what do you do the rest of the time?
Yes.
You know, secretaries and stiff.
You find people jobs?
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
It was okay?
Well I guess...
What?
I can't.
Yeah.   He's a good man.
Hi.
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
I never thought I'd...
I know.
I missed...
So this is it?
It could be fun.
The Monroe?
We're all set,  sir.
Who's this priest I'm thanking?
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
All set.
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or what?
What is it?
You'd hold us back. We have to go on.
Miss Henried, I think you better...
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
Sir. It's quite clear that...
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.
Datura.
Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes.
What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You tell him we was rebels?
We got a boat.
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
What you wanna do?
He is dying. He knows it.
TONY....TONY....
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to...
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
My..."detail", sir. We're going to bury the heads.
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
Step up here, Tyler.
You fired that shot, didn't you?
No, sir.
It's been fired.
Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
What'dya get?
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
Tricks...Jesus...
So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
Sounds boring to me.
You know how many demerits we're talking?
Do they go to Henley Hall?
I don't think they're in school.
Charlie Dalton.
Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
Thigh man?  Mr. "K" was a hell raiser.
I don't know.  I don't get it.
It will?  How do you figure?
Women swoon!
At Chet Danburry's house.
Well?
What do you mean you don't know?
Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
All right.  I'll try anything once.
Yaa, I'm a dead poet!
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
Well...
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
Damn it, Nuwanda.  You idiot.
I told you, that's a secret.
Welcome. back, Mr. Dalton.  How's your father?
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
Hey, he's your roommate.
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying
Who's in?
Charlie...
It's Nuwanda.
Nuwanda, what is going on?
You what?!  How did you do that?
No.
What are you going to do? - Charlie?
Why don't you talk to Mr. Keating about it?
This is stupid.
It's all right, Chet.
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
It does?  What?
Don't stop.
Stop what?
What are you doing?!
You fucked up little prick!
Pleased to meet you.
So, uh, where are you in school?
That's your sister school, right?
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
carpe breastum.  Seize the breast.
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
Then come with me.
Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
Dead Poets honor.
What is that?
I have to go home. Chet might call.
We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
Carpe Diem... seize the day.
Very good, Mr._?
Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
Courtyard?
A yawp?
Good god, boy! Yell!
Yawp!
Again!  Louder!
YAWP!
LOUDER!
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
Come on boys, don't be shy.
Gosh, they don't give you much room around here, do they?
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
Isn't there an easier way?
Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!
All right!  What'd she say?
All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
Where are you going?
Any group pictures in the annual?
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
But father, I'm assistant editor.
I'm sorry, Neil.
But father, it's not fair.
You know me, always taking on too much.
Weird.
I say we go tonight.  Everybody in?
Where is this cave he's talking about?
What is this, a midnight study group?
Look at this.
What is it?
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
My brother went here.
So what do you think of my father?
I'll take him over mine.
What?
Want to come to the study group?
What is it then?
Yes.  But
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
I don't want to read.
I've found it.
A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?
I know that.  What's it got to do with you?
Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
Come on, that's impossible.
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
Er  No.
From you?
From my father and Nolan.
Neil, you're not gonna...
Todd, what's the matter?
It's my birthday.
This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
Oh..
Here, villain, draw and ready. where art thou?
I will be with thee straight.
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
Yea, art thou there?
Put more into it!
Visit from my father.
Do you have to quit the play?
How do we get out of here?
Who are you?
He's the owner...
What the hell are you talking about?
Right here...middle of nowhere...
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
And no questions asked.
Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
How soon can we get up and running?
We were talking about my schedule...
Not an option.
Where are my men?
Hanover, listen...
Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
Did you clear this?
Who gives a shit about aft?
I'm not staying here!
Now look what you did!
What other bunch?
The thieves.
I'm not a thief.
Then who are you?
Unless you collected on the insurance...
What are you people talking about?
Noooo!
Jesus Christ lady...
What are those things?
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
You people...rich people...
I'm not rich people.
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
That's what I do.
Seen a lot of islands?
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
I don't know where it is!
Yeah you did...
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
The "come back" kind.
How do you know that?
Like cattle...
You're saying they can think?
What's the matter?
What is it?
A meat locker.
Looking good...
It's not them...it's it...
Finnegan...
You want ME to go up there?
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
I don't mean to drop in unannounced ...you ready...
You don't take orders very well, do you?
I don't take orders at all.
Where's you friend?
Let's just keep going.
Hanover!! Hanover!!
Shut up! You hear me!!
Can we use our indoor voice please...
Here's what I think...I think these mokes below are a hit sqaud.
...Jagger was here...I was here...
Finnegan, what the hell was that?
Joey... Which way's aft?
Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here?
And what have you come up with?
Man, don't go up there...
Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
Or maybe not.
I mean...where is everbody?
Where are you going?
What the hell does that mean?
Maybe plans changed...
What was that?
Nothing.
Someone's back there.
Check it out!
What is it man?
Maybe it's the wrong ship.
She fucked you?
She fucked me.
She fucked us both.
Yeah.
Fucking women, man...
Fuel up. Need fuel.
Those are mine!
You want 'em?
That's mustard!
I'll get the boots.
Get the boots.
Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!
Yes, Albert?
Who's going?
We're all going.
Nick's going?
Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
Here's to huntin'.
Ammo! Get the ammo!
It is not!
You're full of shit.
Who's full of shit?
You're full of shit!
I'm telling you, they changed it!
They did not!
They did too!
Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
It's Nick!
Tell him, Vince!
Let's go!!!
I know! I fuckin' know!
You don't!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
That's new, isn't it?
Whee-uu!
Married?
He's serious. Vince is fuckin' serious!
Fucking A.
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
Sure. Why not.
You talk to him?
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
I have to go.
But you must come in.
No, I --
But I insist.
I have to go.
I came to see Merle.
You are his friend.
Everybody love Linda.
That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
Wait! First I give you special fuck!
She's in back.
How was huntin'?
Oh. Fine.
No.
You know a guy named Merle?
Yeah?
Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!
Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
Not so good.
Sal.
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
Kind of. You didn't know?
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
Nick, she won't say why.
Biederman! Where's Biederman!
Here.
You Biederman?
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
Linda, what's the matter?
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
Linda, Linda...!
What?
Will you marry me?
Okay.
I don't know what we've been waiting for!
What kind of beer would you like?
I don't know.
How are you?
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
Nick?
What are you doing?
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
You're going hunting?
What?
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
I don't know.
I'm just so lonely.
You seem... disturbed.
Playing?
We... Three bullets.
Who the hell is he?
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
Merle?
Sal!  Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you know anything?
I know.
That way it sets.
I just wait. You know?
So do I.
You do?
You think about it?
The shot?
Yeah... I guess.
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
Nick, he just came back.
What'd he say?
Pow.
Pow.
Is he from here?
Hell no!
From Nam?
Merle --
Promise! You gotta promise!
It's ahead, by the tree.
Hey, Nick?
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
What are you, God?
What are you, hoping?
What else?
I thought you might be praying.
I'm doing that too.
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
Forget Sal.
We gotta play with more bullets.
How many bullets?
Three bullets -- minimum.
When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
Merle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you?
Nick!... I thought you went home.
I like it, Nick.
Bullshit! That's bullshit!
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
Here, here! This is it!
Watch it, shithead!
Then lemme have 'em.
No.
No.
What do you mean, no???
That's it. No. No way.
You're one fuckin' bastard, Merle. You know that? You're one fucking bastard!
Where's Vince?
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
Great. That's great.
Nick. Hey. How's things?
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
What's that noise?
What?
What's that noise?
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
I'm gonna stay here, Nick.
Sal, we need you. We need you.
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
Did you go hunting.
Yeah.
Did you get one?
No.
Where?
Merle gave me this?
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
Well, who'd you get married to?
Cynthia! Sure.
What the hell's that for?
No.
No!
Never one.
You're full of shit!
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
The fuck I did!!!
Up.
Down.
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
Yeah?
Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
What did you say?
Who is it?
I want to ask you a few questions.
Funny guy.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
I'm not on the force anymore.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
I want to see my wife and kid.
Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
Hello Wade.
What is it?  I'm about to go on.
That wasn't your plan, was it?
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
Sir, your transmission's fading.
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
You okay?
How do I look?
Need help?
I got it.  I got it.
You sure?  I can help you.
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
Not the 'T' word.
Are you a cop?
I'm ready.
I have to go home, Sanchez.
See those guys?
They're going to rob that bank.
How do you know?
There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
You can't turn him off.  He's the Commissioner.
Wanna come?
Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.
Hey, buddy...
Why?
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
She's pretty.
You need anything else?
Good night, Wade.
I'll have a cup of coffee?
No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
Yes, sir.
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
You're not pregnant, are you?
What else did he get?
Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
Rip Van Winkle.
How ya feeling?
How do I look?
What's this?
Sanchez...?
I'm here.
You treat her nice.
...Have you been drinking?
You okay?
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
You be careful.
No.  I want to be with you.
You should be in hospital.
This is the guy that killed my partner.
Demolition Man.
What's it mean?
You never want to find out.
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
But he was such a good cop.
You all right?
Yeah.
Seat's too high.
Yes.
What's your name?
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
Bye.  Thanks.
Hi.
Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?
This little thing says I can't.
You could always take it off.
Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A-1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.
Belle Dee. I'm from over the mountain.
I'll take it.
Let's dance together -- Belle.
We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
The people, Jabez -- the people.
Belle --
I didn't.
Lying to you -- Why should I?
Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?
Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
Gee -- that Fair --
Guess there will, if it says so.
Young man -- you got me there.
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
And what about Daniel Webster?
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
But I like the new one better.
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
You're not -- Dorothy.
Never mind. What's your name?
Belle.
No, Stone!
Mornin', Jabez ...
No, you're not.
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
What's the matter with you?
You are afraid!
Afraid ... of what?
But what becomes of our souls?
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
Don't say that -- I know it is --
All right -- so it's buried with you!
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
You know darn well it is.
Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
Coming along, Jabez?
Why -- good morning, Squire.
Oh!
But -- I was just lucky.
Well, Jabez -- I'm a little pressed for time. You wanted to discuss something -- some business --
Why of course --
You are not so sure that he'll come.
Why not -- ?
How much?
Jabez -- help!
I think his leg is broken.
Oh, Jabez.
Well -- what are we going to do?
We can still use my butter money.
Your butter money?
Do you think I'm grudging it?
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
Mary--
Jabez ...
Jabez!
What do you think of that, Jabez?
We must go on home, Jabez.
Tired?
There is nothing to worry about now.
Mary --
I'll get it, Jabez.
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
Mary --
What happened.... Where are you taking him?
I am going to lock him up.
But Jabez, I never said that!
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
Jabez!
Jabez -- Jabez!
You know that, son.
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
Helps sometimes to say it.
What's ailing that dog?
I dunno.
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
It don't matter!
What's that you say, Son?
Ma -- is she? --
My son ... what's the matter?
Let him try it.
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
It seems such an obvious candidature to us all.
Mary -- Jabez --
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!
She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me, right away!
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!
Hullooo!
It's only a short drive, Mr. Webster.
Say, that's pretty good, young man.
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
I want someone to talk to ...
Why don't you?
The past six months.
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
It's okay, it's okay.
But meant her moving here.
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
How 'bout some Christmas music?
It's corny, but I could live with it.
Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
One of yours?
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying?
-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
Bad for your health anyway.
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --
I'm a cop from New York.
Hans.  Your Hans.
I'm going to count to three...
Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
Three down, four to go --
I...have a request.
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
Oh...Where does he live?
I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --
Excuse me, I'm looking for --
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
Safe and sound, thanks to you. What the fuck was that?
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
Al?  Al, you there?
Yeah?  What's the odds?
They way you drive, I can see why.
Hey, you couldn't know.
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
What's going on?
Is that him?
Gene -- you smilin'?
No.  I never smile any more.
They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
These seats come out?
Jesus, you're the man!
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes.
Hey, don't take the car!
Yeah.  A lot of guns.
Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
I'll kiss the baby for you.
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
Hello.  Hello, Leon.
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
Well.... huh ...
Ooohh....
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
Yeah.  It was terrible.
So... that sure is something.
You're crazy.
That's it.
You're really crazy.
I know!
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
What am I supposed to do?
Denmark?  Sweden?
So!  Sal is with you?
Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
I know I am.  I know!
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
Look... who's on the phone?
They won't talk to you.
Are they on the phone still?
That's good then.  You've found something.
Yeah... yeah.
Well, then...
Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.
Right.  See you sometime.
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
What are you doin' in there?
What a fuckin' comedy!  WNEW plays all the hits.
Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now?
They're okay.
You alone, or you got confederates?
I'm not alone.
How many you got in there?
I got Sal.
Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?
Call me Sonny-boy.
One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
I frisk you?
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
Okay, give us the women.
You got these cops outta here. They're comin' in too close.
Calm down, you're not ...
He wanted to kill me!
Okay, what do you give me?
What do you want?
What the hell you doin' back there?
What the fuck do you want?
They were ...
You tryin' to fuck me?
I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
What else?
Yeah?
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
He's all doped up.
Here comes the FBI.  You men lookin' for protection?  We got all the police right here.
Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup!
Hey... let him out!
What's the matter with you?
Howard, give him the keys...
The gun's right on your back...
For God's sake, will you please go now?  We gave you every nickel we got.
Now, you -- what's your name?
Don't ask me questions.  I got connections.  You find out who I am, you're cold meat.
What if I take you with me?
Special to me, too.
You like me?
Would I hire you?
Yeah.
Why not?
Mister Mulvaney?
Yeah?
Are you a lawyer?
No.  I had some legal training, but...
You got Bank Americard?
Everything's all right?  You okay?
Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
Thanks again, Sam.
I'm glad it's okay.
It's up to you ladies.
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
I didn't eat any pizza.
Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?
You were terrific, too!
How did you know your son was involved?
It was on the TV.
Did you know he was a homosexual?
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
I used to, but I stopped.
You stopped?  Why?
Pure?
My body?  What for?
You gonna smoke the cigarette?
Ah, Jesus...
He's gone?
Where's the money?
It's the cops.  Shit!
You mean that?
What?
... The bodies out the door.
I want him to think that.
I want him to think that.
But I want to know what you think.
He wants one.
Dead or alive?
To show that we're negotiating.
We'd kill ourselves.
Does that still go?
Sonny -
They're trying to come through the door!
It's the FBI.  He wants to come in.
Sal?
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
Hey, Sal ... How you doin'?
Okay, Sonny.
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
First off, get the lights back on and the air conditioning.
No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
I want them all.
Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.
Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
Sonny!  Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please?
I don't want him.
Okay - you got your one.
I ain't eaten all day.  I just realized it.
I am.
What are you trying to pull?
I forgot she's in here.
He's got diabetes.  He's not a well person.
My kids ... Kimmy and Jimmy.
Hey, let's get ready!
Here's your document, Sonny.
Fuck!  We did it!
What do you want here, Ma?  You could of watched it on TV.
Oh my God, mother!
Not now, Mom, please.
No!
Why are you doing this?
Doing what?
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
How much?
Morning.
Who the hell is that?
What is it, Choco?
Jesus Christ! What's that smell?
Fella could get used to a life this ordinary.
What about your toe?
Did it hurt?
Hello?
<i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
<i>I'm calling from the Kappa Epsilon Gamma house at California University.</i>
<i>What happened to them?</i>
<i>Remove... ... the... right arm.</i>
I've already formulated a plan.
<i>Did you get all four?</i>
Where is the money?
That's the rumor on the street.
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
HE'S STILL ALIVE, EDNA!
LOCUS! BABY... I'M HERE!
Is that the decoder?
Cunt.
Stop it.
Cunt.
So who is this <i>Choko?</i> Is he your new boyfriend?
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
God help us. God help us all.
You can save that Pretty Woman shit. The name is Domino.
Really? Did you play in a band?
I... <i>love...</i> Pat Benatar.
Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.
Everyone... please give Domino her space. Step back, please!
Where are the bond certificates for the First Ladies?
There are no bond certificates.
What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?
No. What's the big deal?
What did he say about the arm?
Uhhh... I have no idea what you just said.
Many times.
Do you know where Danang is?
Fast and or furious.
This girl is going to be a star. She just tells it like it is.
Where is Domino?
You were good.
How you be?
I be.  I'm living large.
You don't like Public Enemy?  It's the dope shit.
I like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.
Ya back is got.
My brother.
Yo!
What do you want to live in a Black neighborhood for?  Motherfuck gentrification.
So, in other words, you are not down.
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
Extra cheese is two dollars. Y'know dat.

Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa?
Mookie.
Buggin' Out, I gotta work here.

Fifty cents.

Do me a favor.  Go to work.
Jade.
How come you're not at Sal's?
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
Hurry up and get dressed.
I'm coming.
No.
Yo, I'm gone.
I'll see you out.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
He's just being nice.
Nice!
He's completely innocent.
You are too crude.
I'm getting paid...
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
Twenty "D" Duracells.
Twenty "C" Duracells.
How many you say?
Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!
That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
WAKE UP!
You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts.
I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough.
Motherfucker wasn't saying shit.
It's a fucking shame.
Sweet Dick Willie.
That's my name.
Let it be broke.
Can ya dig it?
ML?
What?
Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?
I didn't say nobody, I said you.
Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now you know how I got that name.
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
Mookie, if your friends can't behave, they're not welcome.
Mookie!  How is anybody gonna call in?
Depends.
I would like to get paid now.
Sal, I don't care if you fire me this exact minute, leave my sister alone.
Yeah, do you know 'em?
C'mon, Sal.
Quit bullshitting.
Ya just got paid, so leave me the fuck alone.
Keep it.
It's supposed to be even hotter today.
You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
No.  What are you gonna do?
Gotta go.
Doctor, this is Sal talkin'.
I work too, but I still make time.
When?
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Hot.  Hot.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
Shit!  I forgot.
Your memory is really getting bad.
And I really wanted some ice cream too.
I can run out and get it.
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
I can't be staying long anyway.
You a blue-moon fool.
Then we'll do something else.
What else?
It's cold.
It's 'pose to be cold.
Later for you.
Meda.  Meda.
Where are you going?
Tina, I'll be right back.
Be a man.
Just coolin'.
Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
Smack him back.

You deaf or what?
Who's your favorite basketball player?
It's e-vit-able.
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
Ya like him, huh?
That's what you think?
That's what I think.
I'll do that.
Pino, no joke.  C'mon, answer.
I was going to buy a slice.
I'm listening.
I understand.
Get the broom.
Sez who?
Fuck you and stay off the phone.

I love you.
I'm listening.
Good.  I want you to listen.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
Mookie's OK.
How do you know this?
I know.
I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
I like Mookie a lot.
Pino, get a broom and sweep out front.
Pino, relax, will ya.
I should have Vito go with you all the time.
C'mere.  Don't get too friendly with da Mook.
Too many pizzerias already there.
Then we could try something else.
The both of youse, shaddup.
Pop asked you.
How ya doin', Mookie?
Take it easy, Pop.
Pop, I'm gonna go with Mookie.
Yeah, we're closed. So go away.
Oh my god, are you alright?
Ting tao kuun jahn leeka leeka powww.
She's saying... a beautiful swan...
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah oh che.
CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?
Depends how you define 'new'...
You're the kid who was home schooled.
Hey guys.
Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, Jethica?
Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
Excuse me?
Come over around seven.
O'clock?
Yeah...
Ooh gross.
Would you like something to drink?
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.
Just down the hall.
HARRY? Are you okay?
Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
Okay.
Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready.
The name's Walter.
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
Wow just like Marco Polo.
I don't follow.
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.
Is it okay if he spends the night?
Then a sleep-over is okay by me. Okay boys, eat up.
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
You could've saved that for the tooth fairy!
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
Probably because we've never met.
I haven't seen you around here before.
Home school. Til today.
Home school? What's that?
I think it's just over there.
Is that what I think it is?
No, it's a treasure map.
Don't we want them to talk to us?
No no no no no.
Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!
You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day.
God, she's beautiful. My wiener's all tingly.
The principal.
H A R R Y...
The second R is silent.
One day they'll find a cure.
Got any crazy eights?
Who's Captain Rob?
Peg leg?
Whoa. What was that?
Your mom made a move on me.
You're not my real dad.
You take that back!
Shut Up! Buttlick!
Where did you learn that word?
That would be me, sir. The wife made stew last night.
Collins is a great man!
...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
I didn't know that.
Welcome to public school, my friend.
You're it.
Owww.
According to the map, we're just about at school.
What?
Our own special bus.
Nope. I was right.
Sucks for you.
Who's your partner?
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
Sure I do. On one condition.
Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
Just wanted to see how your doing.
I kinda screwed things up.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
I don't think so.
HARRY, can you hear me?
You have beautiful eyes.
Hey, where did you come from?
Do you want me to pet your head?
I bet you want your head scratched.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
LLOYD, what are you doing? That's JESSICA and... my mom.
But-
HARRY! I found the treasure!
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
Captain Rob came back?
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny?
No one knows?
Me, me, me!
A raft.
A blimp.
George Washington!
Who?
Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
If you have to ask, you don't know.
Yeah, that's why I asked.
You certainly did.
You're it.
Am not.
Are, too.
Hey, it's Jessica.
Hey, look. Ice cream.
But my mom gave me the map.
I lugged it all over town!
I made the polar bear pants.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
I... found that rock.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of your mix tapes.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
Start the tape, Lloyd.
Hey there goes Principal Collins!
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women.
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
The one on the left.
Damn! What are the odds?
What?
She's one of a kind.
Try one in a million!
Sorry, Charlie.
That's gross.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
So can I come along?
Are you wearing a coconut bra?
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
I don't know what you're talking about.
My parents are going to wonder where I am.
TURK, leave him alone.
TURK, what are you doing here?
Special Needs class.
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in!
HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.
Well I was born in St. Louis.
What are you doing here?
So could you get us into the principal's office?
So, when can we do it?
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
I'm so close I can feel it.
Me too. I'm almost there.
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.
... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Do I know you?
Duh. I'm in your class at school.
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
How much homework is there?
Okay.
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
He passed away three years ago.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
Hey you two. Lights out.
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
Have you got what I want?
You know I do!
What are you crazy kids doing in my tool shed?
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself.
Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus.  Lose her!
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
I'm not sure if I can do this.
Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.
I am strong!
I can turn on all the faucets in my house.  Even the hose.
God, I've missed you.
We start our own class?
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
And...?
And, take some more pictures.
Wow, you are smart.
Knock knock.
Who's there?
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
What?
Everything?
Oh, just like the President.
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
JESSICA. Are you sure?
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
My Lord!
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Ecologist?
I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
Yes, my Lord.
We have just folded space from Ix...
Yes?... How was your journey?
Basically...
No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
I'm sorry Gurney.
Paul!!  Paul!!
Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
It could only be one thing....  It's a crysknife.
Remove her gag!
A million deaths are not enough for Yueh...
Run!
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
Man-carved steps.
You've worn a stillsuit before?
Always?
Always.
We call that one Muad'dib.
The Water of Life.
My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well?
We surprised a band of smugglers.
Long live the fighters!
What's in the box?
It burns.
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
Did they try and fail?
What can be done has been done.
... Many men have tried.
Did they try and fail?
Those sounds could be imitated.
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
Greetings.  I am the Count.
Say, that's a funny place to sleep.
So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!
Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
No.  I don't work here.
Why were you buying a coffin?
Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
Are you sure this is okay?
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
Ah!  This is very exciting.
Bela, what happened?!
I didn't feel well...
Let me take you to the hospital.
"Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
Goodbye!  Goodbye!
So how'd we do?
Bela, are you ready?
Mmph?  Where am I?
Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
Eddie, you screwed up.
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Goddamn, it's cold!
Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.
Don't let me slow you down.
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
Why are you here??
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
What are you doing?
I was thinking about killing myself.
Don't worry.
I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
And, cut...
Eddie, how was I?
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
So guess where I'm going next weekend?
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
You mean a Tesla coil?
PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
And, CUT!  PRINT IT!  LET'S MOVE ON!
Rolling.
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
What happened?!  Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
What do you think you're doin'?!
This is kind of a stream--
And who may you be?
Edward Wood, Sir.
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
H-how'd you know?!
I guessed.
I don't understand.
Bravo!  Bravo!  Magnifico!
Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
Will he be okay?
Dolores, give me your shoes.
Ed, it was only one review.
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
Better than not getting a job?
Boris Karloff!?
Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
It takes me comfortable.
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
I'm no good.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
But there's plenty of other parts.
Like <u>what</u>?!
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
I'm going to my mother's.
That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
I'm tired of living on the fringe.
Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
I understand you just moved here?
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
Mr. Ward, it's a delight to meet you.
So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans.
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
But Bela Lugosi's in it!
Mr. Wood?!
Hmm, so you're in the picture business?
Would that work?
Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
Mr. Reynolds!
Glad you could fit me in your schedule.
Could we moovf to table?
So, Mr. Johnson --
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
What is happening?
Is there a script?
Lugosi?
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
Hello.  You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
I got married last night.
Oh.  Congratulations.
The marriage already ended.
Oh, it's you again.
Oh, hi.
You look beat.
I am.  How's your father?
Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.
I just picked them up on the way over...
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
No! I love sex with girls.
Stop!
What was that?
I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...
You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!
No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
Who's Dr. Tom?
I can't get it to go up.
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
Let's get married.
<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph?
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
What's uncanny?
Yes!
You're <u>sure</u>???
What octopus motor?
Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside.
Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.
Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
This is our choir director.  He's gonna play the young hero.
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
Isn't that the same thing?
What if--you're vomiting?
What if I'm vomiting?
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
Yeah, so... ?
How's your mother?
You thought it was me?
I'm moving out.
Did you see that?
This is real, Bananahead!
You think she really likes him?
She doesn't give a shit about him.
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
Great line.
What if Shari's the dream?
Thank you. Can I see her?
Mm...  Oh, man...
Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
Who?
You said that.
You know who we are?
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about this?
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!
Right.
So he killed himself.
Eddie? ...
Are the TV people with you?
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
Hey, he cheated on her.
How's Marcia? She all right?
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
Oh my God!
I mean, that worked out.
I can't believe you're taking his side.
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
Both.
He had girlfriends!
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
She could've been a nurse.
Could've been a nurse?
Eddie...
Mom?
I'm at the hospital.
Oh God. What hospital?
The doctor said you were having sex.
To you? In front of him?  With the...
Oh my god! On TV!
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
Hi. Is Shari here?
No.
What is she, at work?
She won't.
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.
They're gonna mock our foibles.
Our what?
Are you asking me?
Um, yeah, I was gonna ...
I batted!
Hey, Lou.
Dynamite.
So maybe this is my dynamite.
Ha!
Really?
Oh my God.
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Leave. Go.
Can't we just --
What are you doing?
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
Um...
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
I know, I ...
Shari, I really like you...
I really like you too...
... yeah, then, but...
Shari...
Everybody hates me!
No. Who?
There's a list.
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
I'm sorry.
Come on, let's go.
I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
I need to talk.
It's not their fault.
What is?!
Show business.
You're in show business?
Thumbsucker!
I'm making a tape.
I got your message. Way to go!
I'm doing all right.
All right.
Yeah?!
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
Hi.
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God!
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
Why me?
You brought the cameras here!
You brought the girl!
... Ray?
I know.
Look, we gotta talk.
Hi, Shari.
Who's Shari?
No -- keep it.
Hello.
You don't recognize me.
What...
Check forging.
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
What...
Do you still have it?
That girl's an idiot.
Hi.
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
Are you busy tomorrow night?
Can I help with anything?
Mm.
Good?
Ohhh...
Ohh... do you own a cat?
Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
Yo --
pierdo.
Tu
pierdes.
El/ella -
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --
Anything wrong?
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
Yeah, just --
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
Dick... Dick,..
Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --
Okay.  Yeah.  We know
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
Larry?
But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
Well, good luck there, Tracy
Tracy.
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
Hey, that's super
Looks good to me.
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
Thanks for everything.
I can't wait to start campaigning.
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
What do you mean?
Hello, Mr. M.
So what brings you here?
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Yeah.
Plenty of pep, too.
So Tracy?
Why are you doing this?
Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.
What's this?
I want you to do something for me.
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
What a surprise.
You'll be fine.
I hope so
Jim, where the hell have you been?
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Uh, Jim?
Hmm?
Walt needs to see you.
Okay, Jim. I understand.
Just wait outside. Tammy.
Okay.  But is this about the posters?
I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
I did it.
This weekend.
Exactly when?
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
Door was open.
I don't believe you.
Here?
More this way.
Should we get a what?
points at the motel.
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
No, I... uh, didn't know that
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Still clear?
Yep.
Three twenty-five.
What do you want, Jim?
You're there.
Yeah.  I'm here.
Sherry... I love you.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
A mistake?  That was no mistake.
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
Okay, let's say
And 290 "disregards," right?
Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
Where 're you going?
Are you crazy?
What?
People can see this.
But other people can see them too.
I don't care.
Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
We can't both run, can we?  We're brother and sister.  Can we?
For what?
We still have some extra ones, don't we?  Maybe we can just --
It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
Who put you up to this?
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Yeah.
Hell, good luck!
Paul, will you sign my yearbook?
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
That obvious, huh?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
Tell me about Patchett.
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
You say 'fuck' a lot.
Yeah.
Do you enjoy it?
When they deserve it.
Did they deserve it today?
I'm not sure.
Look.  I want to see you again.
So you saved her.
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
Come in out of the rain, Bud.
We talked.
So tell me about it.
In the morning.
Captain, what do you want?
Call me Dudley.
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
Will you work for me?
Of course... But how?
How what, Wendell?
Give me one minute.
Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
Let my daughter rest in peace.
Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.
Stens?  Was it Stens?
Maybe.  I don't know.
What's through here?
Was it... a rat?
One in six.  Where's the girl?
How's it going to look on your report?
It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
Lynn.
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
Let's just kill them.
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
Ellis Loew.
You wanted to meet here?
You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
She's fine.
Richard Stensland.
I don't know him.  Mr...
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
Thanks, but no thanks.
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
Wendell White, how's tricks, <u>paesano</u>?
Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
What do you want to know?
Whose shoe?
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
Clean?
More or less.
Anything?
Where are the police academy files?
I don't have time.  I have --
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
I never truck with no sissies!
I heard you like to shoot dogs.
Dogs got no reason to live.
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
Man, what're you saying?
Ray, we got the shotguns.
I don't own no shotguns.
What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
But you were business associates?
And?
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
Dudley, we've been over this.
Answer yes or no.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.
Ed, I want confessions.
Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.
No... Where'd the tip come from?
I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
<u>No</u>.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
No.
You're the key witness?
<u>Throwing me</u>?
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
L.A.P.D.
Damnit...
What?
Glasses.
I need to speak to you.
I want you to follow Bud White.
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
You make a mistake?
Listen, I think I made a mistake, too.
What?
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
She is Lana Turner.
What?
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
I get the idea.  You got a description?
The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering you about the case?
A vulgar term, but yes.
What's her name?
Lynn Bracken.
Why's she seeing Bud White?
Why do men and women usually see each other?
I'm curious about you.
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
You sound like you mean it.
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
Right now, before I back down.
Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
It seems like my Susan, but...
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
Officer White?
A sweet man.
My daughter was a virgin!
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
Jack!  It's Christmas!
You're back, boychick.
Sid, how are they hanging?
What's he doing here, Sid?
Where'd you hear that?
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
Shut up!
What's wrong, Trash?
No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
Have we met before?
And no one'll know about this?
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
Oh?  Anyplace else?
DePinto's dead.
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
Yes.
What'd he say to you?
Nothing.
What'd he give to you?
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
It's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator.
Listen to me--
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Clear as day.
No one. But I'm a little nervous.
When can you get it here?
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
I'll come straight there.
Tell us about Rachel Banks.
What kind of a question is that?
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
Really?
You knew the deal. No contact.
Who are they?
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
What do they have to do with this?
That's who they are.
Yes.
What <u>is</u> that?
It's a SAT-tracker.
They're spooks.
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
And you won't. Now move--
I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
Did you call anyone?
What do you mean?
I mean did you call anyone.
Look, my wife is understandably--
Jesus!
I called my wife!
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?
I called from a payphone!
What'd I tell you?
How do you know so much?
None of your business.
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
I intercepted phone calls.
What do you think?
Looks like Detroit.
That is one ugly sunrise.
It really is.  Did you find anything?
Yeah.
The NSA killed him.
What's going on?
They're here.
Who?
Them.
Where?
Here?
What the fuck?!
You sure?
You're driving.
Think we let out enough air?
That wasn't so hard.
These guys are incredibly persistent.
Drive.
We're not gonna hurt you.
No he won't.
What about newspapers and magazines?
Same thing?
What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
What if--
Reynolds.
No.
You wanna get caught spying on Albert?
Baudmore Consultants.
The thing is...it really can't wait.
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
Law enforcement?
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Hi, Mr. Dean.
Is it okay?
Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
Do you see anything you like?
I'm married.
Yes. I have her permission.
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
Can you help me?
How 'bout Christian Dior?
It's a little late for that.
I'll say.
What size?
Pardon?
What size?
Eight.  Size eight.
I'll be right back.
Thanks.
Remain calm.
I think she'll like this very much.
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
That's my point.
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
Your stuff?
A report?
A police report.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
About what?
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
What kind of trouble.
You tell me.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
I'm not his attorney.
Than why can't you tell me.
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
Somebody took my blender.
Did he give you anything?
No.
Was he with anyone?
Not that I could see.
No.
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
To buy lingerie.
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
Uh-oh.
Right.
Something bad happened tonight.
What?
I saw a man die.
Bobby?
What do you mean?
Who did you work with to get the--
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
No.
Sorry.
Well, you know--
How could you let me find out like this?
Robert--
I see her for business.
It's not real...  That's not me.
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
Stacy--
Stacy, don't hang up.
I know, but listen--
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
Is Eric in school?
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
Does that hurt?
Well...yeah.
Good.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
You opened the thing?
The lingerie.
That was for Christmas.
...who root through...uh...presents, and...
What is it?
Are you sure you're safe?
They're saying you killed that policeman.
Is it over?
It's really over?
Albert's gonna get me my job back.
I'm sorry about Rachel.
I'm sorry, sir, this card's been declined.
It's a brand new card.
Maybe it's not connected yet.
My suitcase--
Sir?
That ain't me.
It's not?
You don't know who the fuck--
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
Actually, that's not true.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
How's the trout?
It tastes like fish.
Do you like fish?
DePinto?
Brill.
That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
"Soon". Or at least sooner than never.
It's how he works.
Brill?
Yes.
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
Other than Brill.
Other than me.
You're not.
How can I be sure.
Thank you.
Good. You're just what I need right now.
Who's doing this?
You being audited?
For the last four years.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
That's temporary.
Bullshit.
Rachel--
We're screwed.
I'm gonna fix it.
How?
You have to.
I've never met him?
I'm sorry about that.
What makes you think it's you?
It's not me?
Who <u>are</u> you people?
We believe he did.
We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
We'd rather not--
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
We'd rather not--
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
Your shoe.
My shoe?
Seat 74.
What's his name?
Who would do that?
A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
Robert--
She doesn't want to talk to you.
What are you talking--
You're learning a cruel lesson.
Some of 'em.
Can I open 'em up?
Sure, go ahead.
Really?
In your dreams.
Dad!
He's kidding.
Where's mom?
Dad!
Do I know you?
How long can you stay?
Alright!
Did they take your clothes?
No.
Usually they take clothes.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
I love my blender.
They didn't take the silverware?
What?
They only took electrical appliances.
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
He's heard that it's escalated.
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
Jerry--
Christ!
Ssh!
Calm down.
They killed Rachel.
Rachel's dead?
Yes.
Bobby--
They're framing me.
Why would they--
I don't know. I mean--
Why would the NSA--
I don't know!
You're tired.
Jerry--
Listen to me.
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
Go to 'em, Jerry.
I have a family.
I'm sorry, man.
Bobby? Piece of advice?
Yeah?
Turn yourself in.
Jerry?
Yeah?
Bobby--
It's been a few years.
I need help.
Tell me about it.
How can I reach you?
Are you okay?
Are you still in Crystal City?
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
Was Zavitz in trouble?
You think there was a connection to--
You would?
Yes. But we can't.
Yes sir.
What the hell does it mean?
What?
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
What about the tapes?
The originals?
There was a transfer.
We'd have to--
He had help.
He's clever. He had help.
We believe?
Lyle?!
You're kidding me.
No sir.
Dean's with Lyle.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
So they know everything.
If they've looked at the video.
Oh, let's assume that they have.
What about--
We don't know.
Yes?
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
How'd you get in the building?
You have any idea what kind of position this--
Yes?
Puffed cheese?
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
No.
Then let's assume I don't.
How much did you pay?
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
Which stall?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
I don't care to bargain.
Why did you follow me yesterday?
You felt obliged to.
He said - be careful.
Actually, you sing.
Pardon?
You sing.  All the time.
We took several photographs, there's no need.
There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
You should come into the shelter.
What am I looking at?
See what's happening to them - the stars.
No.
Shall we be all right?
And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
Do they know them?
Will you not come in?
No.
Will you please come in?
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
I'm impressed you can sew.
Good.
When were you most happy?
Now.
When were you least happy?
What do you hate most?
A lie.  What do you hate most?
Say you're sick.
I can still taste you.
This is - what is this?
It's a folk song.
Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
Dance with me.
Katharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?
Why did he bring you?
Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
We've got to get you out of here.
It hurts too much.
Why did you hate me?
Yes.  Absolutely.
And a good read.  Don't waste it.
I'm sorry, Katharine.
A broken car?
Safe journey.
Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
Have you seen Katharine?
What?
It's Geoffrey under this.
Could I trouble you for some water?
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
Count Laszlo de Almsy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
Her hands and feet were tied.
And where are the Expedition Maps?
Look, either shut up, or go home.
When's Clifton picking you up?
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
How are you?
Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
David Caravaggio.
Is this you?
It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
Don't cut me.
Or was it Toronto?
Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.
Buon' Giorno! Hana turns, startled and suspicious.
Are you Hana?
You were in Africa?
Yeah, for a while.
Where've you been?
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
Who are his ghosts?
What if I told you he did this to me?
Where did you find that?
I liberated it.
She can take you as far as Florence.
Thief, I think, is more accurate.
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
Irving Berlin.
For?
Have a drink.
What did you say?
The team is in mourning, darling.
I'm fine.  I got hot.
Lady H said she thought you might be -
Right.
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
Apprentices.
Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
Candaules
Candaulesyou're laughing at me.
Are you asleep?
I can already see.
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
I can see my wife in that view.
Are you remembering more?
Could I have a cigarette?
Why?  Can he lay eggs?
He needn't disturb you.
Excuse me -
Well then - yes.  Of course.
This is Captain McGann.
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
I'll probably marry him.
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
Good morning.  Did you know that?  You're always singing?
I've been told that before.
You like him, don't you?  Your voice changes.
Hey! -
I'm still here.
Why don't you go?  You should sleep.
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
I've met you before.
For my hair?
So I follow the wires?
You get Hardy.
Why would anyone do this?
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
Kip - come and dance with me
I try not to expect you.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
This is hot!
Will you come with me?
Of course.  When?
I mean home.  India.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
I'll always go back to that church.
It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
And what if he really is a spy?
He's gone, hasn't he?
No.  He's - no.
Hello.
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
Only we have to go to work.
Does he have to go?
Whoa - give me a chance!
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
You've got a mustache.
A bit of one.
I was looking forward to this evening.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
Go away.
Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women.
Darling, Peter says I could stay
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
This is wonderful!
This was your garden?
Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.
You didn't answer the beeper either.
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
So he popped the pane?
You ordering chop suey again?
You got a better idea?
We've got to catch him in the act.
Why didn't I think of that?
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
We're getting close.
How close?
I don't know, but close.
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
Where are you at least?
Gin? Where the hell are you?
He's on to something bigger.
I have a question...
Who am I?
Why are we speaking Chinese?
No you can't.
I can't?
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
Then don't.
You have a car?
Uh, yes.
Seems I am.
I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
I've got something...
You're not taking me seriously.
So what?
You're shaking. Are you nervous?
I've got something for you.
And I thought we were getting on so well.
But Roki said--
You can't.
We going somewhere?
Maybe I should drive this time.
Very nice.
You want me to pick up a painting?
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
It's a test.
It's a fake.
Give him the card.
He says they turned the card down.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
Motorcycle.
It's one way.
We're going to die, aren't we...
What about your bags?
Those are my clothes.
You stole my luggage? You--
I'm a thief. Sue me.
I don't believe this.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
You're late.
Good morning.
I know it well.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
That's because I wanted them to!
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
On what? Another job?
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
So you're testing <u>me</u> now?
Why don't we take oxygen?
Let's do it again.
Did I hear a car?
Our equipment has arrived.
I didn't mean to get personal.
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
A dozen times.
Got it.
That's it. We're ready.
I trust it's your size.
Thank you.
No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village.
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
Aren't we early?
To us. To the Mask.
You were afraid of heights?
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
Camera in the--
Bookshelf. Sensors--
Popup, on floorboards. And--
We're working.
It's a party.
One, two, three...
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
Ready?
Can you see the other PIRs?
They moved it.
Careful...careful.
We did it.
Okay, you're a thief.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
It's your mistake.
The big job.
What?
Your share.
We're living history here.
I like banks.  That's where the money is.
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
You've got everything planned.
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?
What about the rules?
Well...What are we doing?
The eight billion. From them to us.
Peoples China Bank.
The oscilloscope's already programmed.
That's where the Mask comes in.
So how long till we do this?
There's always a surprise.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
How do I look?
Pulse detectors.
Charged.
Parachute.
No way to take another day or two?
You shouldn't have.
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
You have something in mind?
That was a lifetime ago.
It was wrong to deceive you.
But would you--would you--
Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.
Oh, I don't care about the money.
Four billion dollars.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
Not for me.
The sign of our partnership.
And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about...
China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
Relax, don't jam it...
The disc is still in there.
The door's the only way out!
Jesus.
Come on.
No way.
Hang on.
I cannot get rid of you.
Put this on!
--You're a cop.
You gave them the eight billion.
A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
In the van.
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
This is big enough.
Right.
I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.
Oh, it is.
I said a masked ball, not a costume party.
It's too soon.
The early bird gets the damn worm.
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
Remind me why.
You two make quite a couple.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
Suspicious, after all these years?
You damn well thought wrong.
Tonight your league night?
This is just show and tell.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
She's calling the shots now.
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
You know where my loyalties lie.
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
Call it an expression of trust.
Probably not.
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
What the hell is this doing here?
What's she doing here?
Fax these to this number, okay?
All of 'em?
Which one?
There's more than one?
What?  Hey -- <u>he</u> hit <u>me</u>.
Hi.  Donna Irving?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
This is a real nice place you got here.
I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...
Wow.  Why would they do that?
Cause of the chromium.
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
The judge came up with a number.
I can put them in a good school.
Any school you want.
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
I never lied.  I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
Where's Anna?
You do know how to do that, don't you?
You're a girl.
Course I did.
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
And you can't?
Then I don't get anything either.
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
It's not about working hard --
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
How many families we talking about here?
You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.
Is that what I think it is?
You wanna talk about --
No shit.
Oh, they knew.  They had to know.
I like this case.
You didn't care about my case?
If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.
D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
Someone's following me.
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
Whoa.  No shit.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
Because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>!
Not in my world.
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.
Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
Look, this is serious now.  They're talking serious money --
How dare you take that away from me.
Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
Uh-huh.
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
Fuck Kurt.
Morning!
I don't know what to say.
Say you were wrong.
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
You see your office?
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
Here what comes?
The extortion, the threats ...
What is that?
When'd they file the demur?
Corey.
Did he say why?
Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
You come to the right place.
Pattee?  That your middle name?
Nope.  Maiden.
What kind of chromium is it?
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
Have you been to the water board?
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
Mommy, can I get a flower?
What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?
I don't know.
What's going on in there?
Some meeting.  With PG&E people.
Hey, Ros, where are they?
Can I play roller hockey?
You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
How come her own mom isn't helping her?
Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no holes in my research.
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Annabelle Daniels.
Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here --
I do.
Which number do you want, George?
C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
What're you doing?
What are you doing here?
Great.
It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
That's Ed.
Lock the door.
That is not what I'm --
Thinking.
About this.
More than you need me.
You already packed up your stuff?
Thank you.
And I miss you.
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.
I'm embarrassed.
Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
Yes.  It's called accountability.
Where's my paycheck?
Have you been logging on?
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
There's something else, too.
Dr. Paulsen?
It was .... the Emperor ....
My lord.
Soon, Lord Vader.
He will learn patience.
Much anger in him, like in his father.
Will he finish what he begins?
The boy is our last hope.
I can't ...
You must survive, Luke.
Ben ... Ben ...
... Luke, you must not go.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
Barks a blue streak.
Three patrol ships are heading our way.
Well, it's been awhile.
Barks his concern.
Barks at his master.
... the power?
Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
Give me that!
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
... I told you, I'm not hungry.
Because of my father, I guess.
Yes sir!
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
The temperature is dropping too fast.
What is thy bidding, My Master?
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
Sir, I was wondering ...
Sit down, and shut up!
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
Han, we need you here.
Yes.
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
An Imperial probe droid.
I don't know what he's talking about.
Would it help if I got out and pushed?
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
I take it back.
Why, Princess, this is so sudden.
You don't look angry.
How do I look?
Well, I hope you don't expect more.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
That was no earthquake.
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
Stop that.
You mean a man you can control.
There's something out there!
Where?
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
I see it Chewie, hang on.
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
That depends.  Where are we?
You keep logs?  My, how organized.
Who's staring?
You look silly.
You look great.
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
Thanks to you.
I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
Are you kidding?
All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.
Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
What'd you say?
Luke!
No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
The deflector shields are gone.
The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
Closer?!
What??
Rather touchy, aren't they.
Where are you going?
I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about Han.
Leia!
This hyperdrive had better work.
I have followed my feelings.
I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
I don't believe it.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
Four this time!  The Force you feel.
What's in there?
Free your mind and return he will.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
I'll die first.
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
It won't get through the blockade.
My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
Nobody's going to believe it.
Believe what?
Zira, are you mad?
To a lot of psychiatric small talk --
And we can watch ...
What are they doing here?
Go easy, Stevie.
They look pretty docile.
We shall want a full autopsy ...
Humans?
May I say something personal?
Please
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
He doesn't look like his picture.  I bet he's fake.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
You told me he was dead.
Oh Cuervo...
Where's Plissken?
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
I need a favor.
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
Don't lie to me.
All right, so I made another deal.
I'm already dead.
Dream on, blue eye.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
See you in hell, Snake.
She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
Shut up, Plissken.
What's the little black box do?
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
Not you?
No.
She's in the green.
Lock fuel rods.
Locked.
Plissken...?
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
Getting ready to invade.
Does he know how to activate it?
Stop the damn car.
No way.
Where is it?
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
Me too?
Aw, come on, Snake.
I don't know about this thing.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
What're you doing in here?
Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
No screamin' shit.
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
Don't follow me.
You need help.
This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!
How do we get out of here?
What the hell is this?
What are you gonna do in Venice?
Find Cuervo Jones.
Run, Snake...They're coming.
I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
Where's the anti-toxin...?
Hey, what's going down, Snake?
I'm looking for somebody.
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
All of us?
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
Yield. I have the advantage.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
But your life and lands are far from here.
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
He can be no other.
Who is Merlin?
You saved me from the arrow...
But not from your destiny.
I want to thank you.
Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--
It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--
How? Where?
In the great book.
What?!
A king must marry, after all.
Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then.
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives.
Father...
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
I left it in the tent, sir.
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here.
Who does it serve?
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
There is one.
Who?!
Yes. I would swear my love to you.
The law forbids it.
There are things about love--
Why didn't he kill us?
Just a man. A knight in the King's service.
Very well. Climb up.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
I showed you all my conjuring tricks...
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
They do.
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.
I swear it. By Excalibur and the holy--
The oath. You didn't say--
It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child.
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
Well why are they tearing the building down?
What honey?
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
What's he doing there? Teaching?
No, he's working on another book.
Hello?
Hi
Here.
Oh great, anything else?
And you got an invitation.
Just five or six people.
Maybe the circuit is busy?
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
What didn't he tell you?
Didn't who tell me?
What did the doctor say?
Oh Burke! Poor Burke!
Where do you want this?
What is it?
Phonograph.
I'm gonna miss you.
Me too.
It's serious?
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
May I ask...?
No. Not at all,
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
Not that I know of.
Want to ask him?
When she's well enough, I'll ask.
Oh, she'd love it.
Thank you.
Rats?
But it's clean?
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
Bastard! I will kill you.
Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
Excuse me Miss?
What!
A man to see you.
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
How are you today?
Fine thank you.
Is it coming out Willie?
Why the math?
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
What is it? A tranquilizer?
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
You're kidding! Like what?
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
Hey, come on, I'm grown-up. What'd she say? I mean specifically, Doctor.
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
Do you keep any drugs in your house?
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
Chris MacNeil?
Please go away.
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
Where?
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
Yes am.
Pretty close?
Sure did.
About my daughter?
No I didn't know you had one.
He didn't mention?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
He didn't mention her.
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
That depends.
On what?
I didn't get you?
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Why, I don't understand?
No, you don't understand. Your daughter-
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
Did you know my mother died recently?
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
No, is Regan aware of it?
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
Please.
No it's alright I'll take it straight.
Are you sure?
Where's Regan's father?
In Europe.
No
She...killed Burke Dennings.
Yes. He's already here.
Is she gonna die?
What did you do today?
Um........Stuff.
We'll see when we get home okay.
When can I have one?
Oh look at that.
You like it?
Hey, where'd this come from?
I found it.
Where?
You've been playing with it?
Yeah.
You know how?
Wait a minute you need two.
No you don't. I do it all the time.
You really don't want me to play huh?
Captain who?
Captain Howdy.
Oh, Captain Howdy....
He's nice.
Oh I bet he is.
Regan, why are you reading that?
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
Mr. Dennings?
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
Well I heard differently.
Oh you did. What did you hear?
I don't know, I just thought.
Well your thinking's not so good.
People get tired.
Why does God let us get tired?
What are you doing here?
Oh my God!
So something please Doctor, Help her!
Honey this is Father Dyer.
Damien Karras.
Hi Chris. Great party.
She doesn't remeber a thing.
Goodbye Father. I call you.
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal? The poor box?
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
Where'd you get it then?
I stole it.
Think you can sleep?
Goodnight Dims.
I came to say goodbye.
You just missed them.
Do you like films?
What's playing.
Withering Heights.
I've seen it.
Another one. Had your lunch?
You might loosen the straps then.
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
Where's Regan?
You'd like that?
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
It would bring us together.
You and Regan?
Do it again.
In time.
Ego te abslovo.
Quod nomen mihi est?
Quod nomen mihi est?
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
What's that?
Uoy era ohw.
I'm all right.
Oh really, when?
Dimmy, you worry for something?
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
Let the enemy have no power over her.
And let my cry come unto thee.
The Lord be with you.
Amen
Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The reponse please Damien!
And let my cry come unto thee.
The Lord be with you.
Amen.
What is it?
Her heart.
You're not my mother!!!
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.
Really?
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
It's possible. Possible however
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
I don't know anyone who fits the description.
Is that a threat?
Hey, Father? You like movies?
Come on!
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
MERRIN!!!!!!!
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
Fuck him!!!

Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!
Miss?
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Do you have an appointment?
Yes
Are you comfortable Regan?
Yes.
How old are you?
Twelve.
Is there someone inside you?
Who is it?
I don't know.
Is it Captain Howdy?
No.
Why not?
Give me the keys.
You're not going to drive.
Give me the keys!
You're not going to drive!
It's my goddamn car!
It's our goddamn car!
Give me the keys.
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Yeah, come on in.
Little slow tonight.
What's this?
Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.
Take it now.
What about tomorrow?
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
Trunks?
Swimming trunks.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
We have some lotion.
Just the same.
Well, look at this.
Beasley.
Baker.
What's our friend's problem?
Teeth.
What's wrong with them?
They gotta go.
No bones?
Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
You the magician?
Piano.
Two at a time?
Oh.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!
How's the birthday girl?
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
Oh my God ...
Out.
What's the gig?
How we doing?
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
Am I late?
That's not the point.
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
Jack.
Frank.
Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Don't make trouble, all right?
I mean it, Jack.  Behave.
Huh?
Count it.
Jack...
Fuck him.
I hate your kids, Frank.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
What d'ya got?,
Bosen black.  Flat.
What d'ya got?
What do you think?
You look awful.
Thanks.
Really.  You sleeping?
Only on odd days.
Seeing anyone in particular?
I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
Funny.  Strike a bell?
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
No, I mean it.
So do I.
This time you gotta go.
I don't gotta go.
You gotta go.
Says who?
So what'd we get her?
I made her nervous.
What do you mean?
What's with Charlie?
Yeah?
It's me.
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
It's not family.  It's business.
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
We don't get a gig.
So you'll come out, right?
Jack.
Nice, huh?
What?
The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
I don't know what you mean.
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
It wasn't like that.
No?
No.
Yeah, and what put him up there?
That's what we agreed.
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
Jack.
Let's get it over with.
You're getting cold feet about this.
I'll drop the eighths.
Where the hell is she?
Get out of here.
Come on, stand still.
Get out of here!
It's not gonna hurt you.
All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
No.
See anything?
Something, huh?  All those bids.
Yeah.  Something.
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
You all right?
Hey, Frank.
You recognized me.
Just a lucky guess.
So what do you think?
November.  '71.
First night?
Day.  Wednesday.
She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
He's drunk.
Have some more wine, Frank.
Right.
Unless you want the right.
You leaving that on?
Yeah.
All night?
Yeah.  You mind?
Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean.
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
Right.  I love you, Frank.
How dare you say you love me.
How's it coming?
They stopped serving two hours ago.
Two hours ago!
You haven't seen Susie, have you?
Funny, huh?
What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
You saw wrong.
He's with the hotel.  I called him.
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
What're you doing down here?
Celebrating.  Join me?
Couple years.
February?
He was just having fun.
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
The tenth's out.
I can't make the tenth.
What're you doing?
Just until we find another girl.
We're not getting paid then.
No.
What's it for?
I don't know. Some disease.
What disease?
I don't know.
What channels it on?
We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
Jack, you're on television.
Jack!
I didn't hear you come in.
Go ahead.
I'll take the Mallory.
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
Charlie called.
Five years ago.  November.
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
Spur of the moment.
So what'd you think?
Thrilling.  Both of you.
No, no.  You boys are tired.
You sure?
Your limo's ready, Ma.
Sick?  How sick?
The flu.
So she's got a few sniffles.
You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
Actually, that's my stage name.
And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
Uh... he knows it.
Yes, it is.
This where the auditions are?
This is where the auditions were.
What do you mean?
We're finished.
My watch is broken, too.
Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
Don't take it personally.
How should I take it?
We ran long.
So run a little longer.
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.
I sing now?
So?
When?
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
What I mean is --
We're a team.  We work together.
Where's my name?
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
Changed?
Where's your dress?
Do I look like I'm naked?
That!  You can't wear that!
What's wrong with it?
It's orange!
Come on.
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
I wear a seven.
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Nine.
Nine?
Nine!
Uh... good.
Shoes?
They're tight.
They're nines.
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
The switch.  Hit the switch.
I said I was sorry.
Give me that.
Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
You two could play checkers.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
You play all these places?
Virgins.
Go ahead.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Hey, we're connected.
Great.
Great?
You're kidding me.
As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
Peggy Lee?
Hey, will you look at that?
They must've bought the same map we did.
What do you say we send a bottle over?
Huh?
Got another song for us?
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
Huh?
I can't sing it anymore.
That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
Yes, well, they are.
Is that important?
Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.
Whatcha doin' over there?
Gotta go.
How come?
Funny hours.
Funny job.
Barker.  Jock Barker?
Baker.  Jack Baker.
Right.  Bring him back.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
Baker.
Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
Yeah.
All right.  Hold on.
The name's Baker --
Save it.  What's he look like?
Frank works hard.
And you don't?
He leads, I follow.
Is that the way it is?
You miss him, don't you?
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
Where's egghead?
Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir.
Forget it.
Every year.
Aren't the kids asleep?
Every year.
So why's he do it?
It's okay.  Last one.
Can't sleep?
It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
How's egghead?
Like a baby. You?
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
Relax.  We'll drop the song.
Guess I got a little scattered.
I can keep the beat.
What's the matter?
What'd I say?
Nothing.
You're upset.
I'm not upset.
All I said was you were good.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
You were good.
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
You were good.
Nina?
Who's Nina?
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
Must've been a cheap date.
Soap convention.
History.
The both of them?  In there?
He called her.
Long story.
He had a mind that escalated things.
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
Frank said ---
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Coffee?
Yeah... No.
Look, if you want to leave...
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
You can always get another girl.
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
So ... ?
You don't pick your brother.
So how's the cat food business?
What kind?
Huh?
Let me get the light.
Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Another five years, huh?
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
Did you break a cup, Jack?
Guess they're up.
Is that what you used to do?
What are they?
Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
How do you know?
Oh?
I guess it's getting serious.
Ivory.
Looks old.
What's a prom?
Okay.  How'd yours go?
Jack.
Merry Christmas, Jack.
John.  It's good to see you.
So. How are you?
Big piece or little?
Huh? Oh, no.
None?
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
What did he do?
Fine work, Jon.
Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
Jesus Christ, Castor.
Where am I?
Perfect fit.
Nice-looking kid.
Pollux ...
You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
A few blanks?  Like what?
After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me.
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
That's not the worst part.
Thanks, Pollux.
For what?
For being one helluva guy.
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
We need to talk.
I'm late for surgery.
... I was dreaming ...
Must've been after we got engaged.
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
Whoever you are, don't call again.
I took it from my fake husband.
Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
What more proof do you need?
Would it?
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.
-- Castor?
Not anymore.
What -- what are you doing?
Jamie ...
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
SFPD?  Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
Clarissa left those here.
I won't tell mom if you don't.
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
Kim?
That's your name, isn't it?
You've got someone in your office.
What happened?
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
I'm just having some fun.
Eight pocket stingers ... seven piper uzis ... six cobra carbines ...  five - net - launch-ers ...
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
You're the only person in this place who can see right through me.
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
What happened to your big "assignment"?
What do you know about it?
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
What is with you tonight?
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
I'm not going anywhere.
You're wearing your suit --
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Oh, that Karl.
What are you doing?
Back then -- who wasn't?
Oh, and Oxxford called...
Her assistant?
So you left her?  Just like that?
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
You have kids, Jack?
Thats right. And auto supply...
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
And I know people.
Take you, for instance...
Good for you. Why shouldnt you protect whats yours.
But I think I like you better this way...
Rise...and...shine...!
Mom, dont you think we need to open the presents?
Fightings a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
Wheres my real dad?
They did a pretty good job.
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
Do you like kids?
On a case by case basis...
You know how to make chocolate milk?
Got it.  Good tip.
Where do I go now?
Big Eds?  Big Eds Tires?  Why...?
One year he had a solar system named after her...
Very nice. What is it?
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
What are you doing?
Im having kind of a bad day.
Is it...?
Trouble at work?
I dont think so.
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
She said that?
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
Im telling you, those rules dont apply to me, Arn.
So Jack, its your wifes birthday, got anything to say to her?
Hey, you cant park that thing here.
Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
Yes, thats it...yes, we went to high school together.
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
Wheres my car?!  Wheres my Ferrari!?
What the hell are you talking about?  Whats he talking about?
DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
No.
Like I said, it's a business deal...
How'd you know my name was Jack?
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
Yeah?  What do you need?
You just said everyone needs something.
You still think this is about me, don't you?
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
Its a glimpse, Jacko.
Whats this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?
Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.
What!?  Look at the ticket...!
You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!
Like the dress...?
Something like that.
Need a nurse?
Are we...?
Are we what, Jack?
Are we finally being honest?
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
No, I didnt...thats great.
Here we are, mag wheels...  Hey Jack, are you sure youre okay?
Kates on two, Jack.  Nice ride...
If youre into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.
You mean dont go at all? What about my internship?
Go. Im sorry, you should just go...
No, youre right.  What are we doing?
I can't seem to let go of you...
Are you okay?
What kind of man does that!?
I was in the city.
The city?  New York City?  Why?
Because thats where I live.
Party?  Oh no, I cant go to a party...
Why not?
Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?
Here you go...
Youre kidding me...
Shes your dog, Jack.
Hello!
...my feet are hurtin...
Uh...that babys crying...
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
Wait a second.  You want me, dont you?
No, Im serious...youre really stunning...
$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?
I think it worked out okay, dont you?
Sure.  I really like Annie.
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didnt we?
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
Our life in a nutshell...
You want the cake!?
Thank you...
Say it, Jack...
Cmon, you know what I like to hear...
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Nice, Jack.  Youre sweeping me off my feet.
You really are incredible...
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
And now...?
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
Good things...
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
Im out of the doghouse?
My god, all this time...I never stopped loving you...
Pretty incredible, isnt it?
Think bigger.
This place is a perk, Kate.
Im talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
Its been interesting, thats for sure.
But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
I promise, Jack...
Promise me again...
You look great.
I'm sorry...
To Paris. Paris, France.
So youre not at a non- profit firm?
Not with what they pay me...
Youre not married, are you?
You cant go!
Jesus, Jack...
Dont do this, Jack... But he continues...
Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
I need you, tiger..
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Peter Lassiter...
...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
He certainly has your number, Alan.
For one thing, you like expensive things.
Can I help you?
Damn...damn...damn...
Hey, are you okay?
No...Im not...
Of course I did.
I want to see you again.
I'd like that, too.
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
Don't you have anywhere to go?
Thats totally see through...
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
I wouldn't know anything about that.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
How'd you know it was me?
I'm not really dressed for a party.
Relax, it's casual.
We're going to have to work on your touch.
I can't take this.
He <u>knew</u> about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down --
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
They crashed it into a wall.  A flight <i>simulator</i>.
Five times.
I had it at four.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --
He's smart, powerful, successful --
What the --!
Ben.  Are you okay?
We had a tough year.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
We're working as hard as we can --
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
'Course not.  Strictly business.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Reed? ... Sue?
The machine works.  And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
Deb... It's me.  I need you to step out front.
What did you wish for, honey?
What are <u>you</u> doing here?
Ben, come in.
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
You look like an eighties rock band.
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
He didn't.
Oh, he did.
He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
<u>Where is Reed</u>?
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
He's not responsive --
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
This is wrong in so many ways.
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
Back it down, Johnny!
What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.
But all these people...
You're hot!
So are you!
Me like-y.
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
I though we went over this.
Not this again --
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Apparently I can disappear.
Stop it.
What is that <i>thing</i>?
Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
You're really cramping my style here.
I'm driving.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
They're ready for you, sir.
Leonard, how's the feed?
Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Come on, Ben, come on...
Ben did this.
Didn't go as <u>planned</u>?  It was a <u>catastrophe</u>.  You ruined the lives of four people --
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Feeling better?
Yes, thanks.
Which was?
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
And reverse the mutations --
But <u>we're</u> the focus, right Reed? <u>Reed</u>...?
And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
I can...make it work.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
I found a broken gasket, from space --
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
What are you doing?
Raising the shields.
What's going on?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
He's working round the clock.  But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
Please don't make this personal --
Oh, I think you already have.
Where do we stand?
Okay to proceed.
They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
The less time, the better.
That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
I told you to cut down on the sugar.
I'd hold that off awhile.
Benes... What the devil happened?
The Other Side got to him.
How bad off is he?
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
His technician okay? In addition to the Looks Department?
<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
And take a little trip with them...
You mean <I'm> going along?
As part of the Crew.
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]
Listen...the Heart.
We must!
Doctor...
Yes, Cora.
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
A long time, with one man.
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
-- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock.
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
Then how come it worked loose?
No, it requires such absolute precision --
Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
Open it! Open it before they get here!
No need to get up --
Thank you for saving my life.
That's what they pay me for.
Such as?
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
I've done all I could with the laser.
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
You left something out.
What's that?
You mean Inner Space is endless?
I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway...
Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
We'll never get there in time, at this rate.
You said there was a quick way out!
What about Dr. Michaels?
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
Tell them to take us out.
If there's any chance --
Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --
All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
Grant -- wait a minute -- you're not going to dismantle the wireless?
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
You have no right to blame Duval --
You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
Two in a row?
Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.
They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution.
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
I can't tell you.
May I?
What'd you do that for?
I'm married.
Sort of.
Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
'Prepare for Miniaturization'...
Any reserve air?
What happened?
Come on -- it's no use!
How's it look?
I'll never find my way through that.
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
Then don't drift down further.
Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
...What do you mean, you decided not to park here?
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Drop that fucking money!
No Jean, no money!
...Is this a fucking joke?
This is a new car, then, sir?
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
Or your fucking wife, you know.
Where is Pancakes Hause?
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
She started shrieking, you know.
...So I guess that's it, then.  Here's the keys -
No, that's not it, Jerry.
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
Personal matters.
...Who's Jean?
...Blood has been shed.
Three people. In Brainerd.
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
...The heck d'ya mean?
GOT IT?
End a April.
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
Oh, yah, I know that!
Oh, now he's adorable.
Yah, he -
Oh, don't be silly.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
How ya doin'?
Mr. Mohra?
Yah.
Officer Olson.
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
Uh-huh - in what way?
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
Yah, got a front movin' in.
Hiya, Norm. How ya doin', Margie? How's the fricassee?
Uh-huh... A what?
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
Uh-huh.
Where you girls from?
In what way?
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.
Uh-huh.
A subconscious-type thing.
I'm talkin' about your potential.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
Yah.
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
...Mr. Lundegaard?
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
but do you know that for sure without -
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
Sir? Right now?
...If it's so damned important to ya!
Hon? Got the growshries.
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Yah, real good.
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
Okay.
Well... yah.
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
Yah!
Jerome Lundegaard?
Yah.
Good day, sir.
...Dad?
It's okay, Scotty.
We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.

Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
No kiddin'?
Yah.
Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -
Stan and I're okay.
Yah.
We're good to loan in.

...There's a million dollars here!
Put you in touch with Grimsrud.
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Well, I don't vouch for him.
Well, that's okay, I just -
Where is everybody?
Ya see something down there, Chief?
Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
Geez, you okay, Margie?
...Well, that passed.
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
There's two of 'em, Lou!
Yah, woulda been cold out here.
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
You don't think he's mixed up in -
Yah, that's a good one.
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
Gotta go?
I'll fix ya some eggs.
That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
...I'll fix ya some eggs.
Yah, yah, course I remember.  How are ya? What time is it?
Yah, that's me.
Well, how the heck are ya?
Okay, ya know. Okay.

Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -
I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
Yep.
Anyone else residing there?
Hello?
Yah, is this Marge?
Margie Olmstead?
...Hello?
No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd.
His wife?
Linda.
No.
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
The day of our homicides.
And this guy is...
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
Gustafson's accountant.
- looking.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Still missing. We're looking.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Copy.
We've got a -
Whose car?
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
...Chief Gunderson?
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
Hon?
Yah?
Yah.
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Oh, fine.
Not on your feet too much?
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
They announced it?
...So?
Your mallard?
Yah.
It's just the three cent.
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
Yah, I guess.
I love you, Margie.
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
This is do-able.
I'm tellin' ya.
That wouldn't interest you.
Where's Tyler?
The first rule of Project --
I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?
You are a moron.
Cornelius!  How are you?
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
Better than I've ever been in my life.
No.  I found something new.
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
You are?!
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.
Have you finished those reports?
Is that your blood?
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
No, I wasn't aware...
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
The dynamite...
What does that mean?
It means it was homemade.
Who do you think could've done this?
No, you can't die of insomnia.
You need to lighten up.
Can't you give me something?
We need to talk.
And I saw you practicing this...
I'll expose you.
Why are you doing this?
It becomes an addiction.
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
You're kidding.
I want that.
You can't have the whole brain!
So far, you have four and I only have two!
That's your favorite, too?  Tried to slip it by me, eh?
That's the idea -- we split them.
You haven't been going to yours.
I found a new one.
It's for men.
Like testicular cancer?
This could go on for hours.
What are you doing here?
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
It's time for you to leave.
No, thanks.
Where?  Here?
Here.
There?
Here.
Here.
Make sure.
Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
You feel nothing?
Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.
I think everything's okay here.
I could check your prostate.
Uh ... nah.
You... don't have to... leave.
Chloe's dead.
When?
Do you care?
You hear that?
Hear what?
What is this?  Who did this?
... A person.
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Why would you get bent if I asked?
Let go of me...  Leave me alone.
The Paper Street Soap Company.
Can I come in?
He's not here.
Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we ever had sex?
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Is this a trick?
We did make love?
Is that what you're calling it?
We've just lost cabin pressure.
What did you say... ?
What is wrong with you?
Say my name.
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
You are an insane person.
Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to see you again!
I'm not paying this back.  I consider it "asshole tax."
What happened... ?
My God, you're shot...
Who did this to you?
Hello?
Who's this?
Tyler?
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
... and you come home to this.
How have you been?
... You know me?
Yes... it's a test.
Who do you think I am?
You're the one who did this to me. You're Mr. Durden, sir.  Tyler Durden.
This is how I met --
What do you do, Tyler?
What do you want me to do?
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
Thank you.
What?
Being clever.
I guess so.
And, now it's gone.
But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.
Delivered from Swedish furniture.
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
Well, I have to file a claim...
Don't I?
Do what you like.
A hotel?
Would that be a problem?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Can I stay at your place?
Yes, you can.
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.
He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
Go ahead.  Say it.
This is crazy.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.
How do you feel?
Strange.
But a good strange.
Call what off?
The fight.
My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?
Where's your car?
Hum.
What are you reading?
If you could fight any celebrity?
Alive or dead?
Doesn't matter.
Hemingway.  You?
Any historical figure.
Okay... Ghandi.
Good answer.
You're sure?
You're okay with this?
She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay away from that one.
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
Okay.
Promise you won't.
Yes, I promise.
Promise?
I said I promise!
You want to finish her off?
What is this place?
Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it.
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
It isn't... ?
We don't need him...
No thanks, I quit.
You quit?
Yeah.  Where you headed?
What... ?
Six months advance pay.  Six months!
Fucking sweet.
There's fight club in Delaware City.
Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
What are we doing?
I asked you what you studied.
I feel sick.
Hey.
Something on your mind?
Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"
You know what I mean.
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
What are you talking about?
This conversation...
You're too young.  Sorry.
Four in Milwaukee.
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
Why do people think I'm you?
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
Why did you do that?
Answer me, Tyler.
Why do people think anything?
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
Oh, yeah.  I didn't really know my Dad...
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
What... what are you saying?
No!  This isn't true.  We... we were around other people, together, both of us...
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
What about them?  They're lunatics.
You took me to the house.
The house is rented in your name.
You have jobs.
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
What about Marla?
What about Marla?
What a ridiculous thing to say.
I'm going to...
...stop me?
I'm not going...
...to let this happen!
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
If I'm wrong, we're both dead..
I'm pulling the green wire.
Fuck you.
Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
You want out?
Tyler...
What?
Ask me nicely.
Defuse the bomb, please.
Defuse the bomb?
Can't you call it off... ?
What the fuck -- ?
Paraffin.
Not exactly according to plan.
NO...
Why... why... why... ?
Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
I swear on my life, I won't...
What are you doing?
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
Do something for me.
What?
What?
What?
Who is this?
Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid.
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
You told me you'd say that.
Abort the plan.
You told me you'd say that, too.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name...
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
His name is Robert Paulson!
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
There is no money.
Really?
It's free to all.
Ain't that something?
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
Did you hear what I just said?!
What are you doing?!
Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me!
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
Biology, mostly.
Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
Would you rather be dead?
Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
The second one just dies.  A 16 year old kid.
You have to tell us now.
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
Speed up.
No!  It can't be.
Should we knock?
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
Calm down, Kimmy.  It's not drugs, just weed.
A Trans Am.  That shit went out with New Kids on the Block.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again.  Did you?
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
Please.  It's not going to wait.
I've got to stop and help those people.
Are you Jorge Cruz?
Maybe.  What's this about?
May we come in?
What was the fight about?
Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.
We have to tell her she's in danger!
This is cheery.
Whoa, nine months?
Guys, let's not panic.  Isabella's safe.
Are you okay?  You just face planted!
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
Want me to drive?
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
And you're gonna die after me, right?
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
Kimberly?  It's Dad.
I mean it.  Take care of it.
What feeling?
I'm sorry.  I'm just so happy that you're safe.
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
What on Earth are they doing?
Mom?
This place?!
Thirty-nine.
No.
Remember the departure time?
4:25.
Most kids do, I guess.
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
Stop the car!
Can't you open the door?!
Carter, get out!
You know what to do.
I'll remove him.
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
We're losing our favorite teacher.
Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
I'm sorry we broke in.
And don't pass on the right.
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
It broke!
What are you doing?
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
Get control of yourself!
Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
Gettin' old, huh?
Show me how it operates.
You read me, Brewer?
Batteries not included.
I've seen worse places.
This place is a trip.
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
No cigarettes.
What's this stuff on the rice?
What's she saying?
What's that?
How you doing, Brewer?
Roundeye.
That guy's not going to make it.
You never been in one of those things.
You better take off.
Yes.
Gawd, you look awful.
Can you handle the door gun?
You're gonna love it.
I'm Rambo.  This is Brewer.  Her name is Co.
Where did you find this clown?
Spooks?
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
I do?
You think you are... .
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
I know.  I go with you.
Yes you can.
John.  My name is John.
Stay on your heading, Captain.
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
That's an order.
I don't work with spooks.  Not after that op in Cambodia.
Where?
Not yet.
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.
All this is for us?
What?
How long have you been setting up?
About 22 hours on site.
How long before you're fully on line?
It's not necessary.
I know...
Who're you?
American.  Come to get you out.
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
Hello, John.
Colonel.
I hear you're not enjoying it here.
This your stuff?
Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever trained.
Those men are all dead.
Congressional Medal of Honor.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
We left some people behind there, John... POWs.
But now it's free, right?
Well did you or didn't you?
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
I like your nails.  Where did you get them done?
Well, there's nobody special!
I never really...went through a... dating period.
Really?
Oh, no..I have to get home...
Most men are.
Yep! Right on it!
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?
It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
I was attacked.
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
No, I'm fine... really...
... So... where did you sleep last night?
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
Can I have my desk please.
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
He's not a moron.
I... You're not going to understand this.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
What does that mean?
See, I told you!
Well talk back.  He won't bite you.
So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?
My agent.  I called my agent.
... What?... You don't want to commute?
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us?
Where you comin' from?!
Uh... basement I think...
Can I help you?
I'm... just looking for Parry...
I wanna go...Just let me go...
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
Where?  Maybe we can.
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Remember. One chorus and out.
It's O.K...It's O.K...Lets me help you up.
NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
It was a crime.
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
Yes... I... I agree...
.....Me neither.
No, I have to work.
How un-sixties of you.
Hello Lydia?
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
Free?
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
Please don't hurt me?
I need a drink.
Have I died?
No... thanks... Listen --
My name is Parry.
Hi... Where are my shoes?
They're --  -- What?
Where -- ?
<u>What</u>?!
The Little People?
They said you're The One.
I'm the one what?
... Do you know who I am?
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
The Little...
They work for Him.
See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it...
Parry.
Parry... I'm Jack.
I'm not married.
Do you follow her every day?
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
What's her name?
Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!
That's O.K.
But I gave it to you!
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
Will you shut-up!!!
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
The Red Knight!
It's such a great song.
Are there any questions?
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
Holdin' my penis...
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
OWWW....What are you nuts?!
I advise you to let us go.
You advise us!
Are you all right?
Parry Parry?
No just Parry.
How about the "Hell Merchants"?
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
What do you do - for a living I mean?
Tell me more. I want to know everything.
There isn't any more to tell.
Well, it's enough for me.
You don't have to say that.
Excuse me...
You're married.
No.
Divorced.
No, I...
You have a disease.
Twinky?
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
You're not going to play it again.
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
Serveza yourself!
Now, now.
You can sing the song.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
I can't help it, honey, the ball just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on me...
I did, didn' I, El?
I'm not.
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.
You're the pathetic one, not me.
I'm not some piece a crap.
I know you're not.
You treat me like I was.
You're goin' a find me dead one time.
I'll be gone two or three weeks.
You like it?
"Every trail that you blaze/Makes me..."
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
Is what you?
You're depressed that I come along.
Who said I was depressed?
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
Sure...
Rayette.
What?
No.
Sure you don't want anything?
What's your name?
Where are you going?
Alaska.
Can I get you anything else?
No. How much do I owe you?
I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
You want me to hold the chicken.
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
Oh my goodness... Bobby...
Robert Eroica...
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
I just can't look at you.
You always do this to me.
No.
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
Robert...
I have to talk seriously with you...
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
What?
Daddy's very ill.
Oh, well, what, what's he...
Well...  I better let you...
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
Tita, I've got to go...
How long have you been staying here?
Uhm hmm. Some range.
Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
Do you want some gingerbread?
Look at that.
Why are you being so mean?
I think he's got a terrific personality.
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
Where is she, anyway?
It's none of your business!
Where's Catherine?!
I'm talking to you, Tita!
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
You were going without saying goodbye?
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
But what about me?
Bye, now.
Yes, intentionally.
That's dangerous, you know.
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
The day after tomorrow.
If you're free.
You don't call that music, though.
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
I didn't have any.
You had no inner feeling?
What?
You think I'm a fake.
I think it's what you think.
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
I don't find your language that charming.
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
Serious, that's what's important to you?
No, don't do that...
No inner feeling.
That's right.
That's what you said?
Is he?
Robert?
Oh. You have to tell me that.
Yes.
Four or five years.
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
Robert, do you mind?
I'm not aware of it. Like what?
Oh, for chrissakes...
Robert, I think you better just...
What kind of doggy is that?
It is true.
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
Don't call me "honey," mack.
You better hold onto your tongue!
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
Well, she was.
Miss Dupea.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
If you want to call it that.
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
Aaron, how you doin'?
Fine.
Why you have an attitude for?
There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
Who are you?
Do you have a name?
Victor.
What?
Wussup?
Yo.
Hi.
Remember me, from the pool?
So watcha doin'?
Nothin'.
What are you doin' here?
I, umm, came to see you.
You know somebody around here?
Whadja wanna see me about?
So you got a girl?
Of course.
A play-ya.
Just chill.
So what you think of me?
I buy them flowers.
How you treat them?
I kissed those girls.
Come down!
Wussup?
Why don't you ask Eddie?
Why?
I got punished, man.
Wha'?
She fucks it all up!
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
So what girls are over there?
Where you goin'?
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
Eddie from Compost?
Which one?
She lives near Eddie?
Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
I think by Twenty-two.
For real?
A bad attitude.
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
I think he's 18 or 17.
You gonna talk to him?
Yeah.
You looking for somebody?
Wha'?
You here to see somebody?
Yeah.
Who?
A girl named Amanda.
What she look like?
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
Yo, that's my girl.
Positive.
You sure?
My friend told me she lived around here.
Your friend must be misinformed.
So what do you want with her anyway?
I'm a good friend of hers.
Probably.  One of the many.
What?
No.
Not really.
Hey!
Where you know Amanda from?
Jus' from around the way.
You live around here?
Yeah.
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
You mean her.
Maybe tonight?
That's what he said.
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
Sonofabitch.
Wonder who his supplier is.
I have no idea.
I ought to get some sleep.
Creasy, how old are you?
Hey, what are you doing?
Fletch, this is dumb.
Hey you're really nuts.
They didn't do anything.
What? What are you talking about?
You're lucky.
Fletch.
Full name.
Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
My God, you're serious.
Ask anybody.
Not a prayer.
Thanks for coming down to see us.
Greetings, everyone.
This one's going to be even more fun.
What the hell are you doing here?
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
So where do you know Alan from?
We play tennis at the club.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
That's Babar.
Two bs?
One. B-a-b-a-r.
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
Your aunt?
Mrs. Smith.
Joan or Margaret Smith.
Right.
Well, which one?
Margaret.
Funny old bird.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
No idea.
No idea at all?
Okay. Some idea.
Like when?
Like tonight.
Jesus.
You don't know me.
My pleasure.
I'm serious, Sam.
What, the heat here?
Affirmative.
The two surfer boys?
Affirmative.
You don't have a piece of the action?
What?
You find the source?
Are you all right, Doctor?
Where am I?
You're in the Records Room.
I'm fine.
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
Here you are, Doctor.
I guess not.
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
Until she remarries, Fletch.
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
My lawyer was a bum.
You may be right.
That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
Read this, please.
Wait a second --
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attach cases.
My parents were great fans of the former President.
Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
Right.
Isn't that nice. Since when?
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
Then he has.
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
John Ultramalensky, right?
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
Hi Gummy. Hows the eye?
I know.
They bust you every week.
I'm the Sufi.
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
Sure you did.
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
That's Brazil.
Yeah. Maybe.
We can't talk about it here.
Why not?
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent.
I'm all ears.
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
Do you have a passport?
Where am I going?
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
That's right.
Will you kill me?
Can I steal you for a minute?
Deal.
Shoot.
Did you hear something?
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
Not our kind of people, you understand.
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'
I wonder if that's his doctor.
Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout. But I did ---
Did you say cops?
My hero.
Cute young thing, too.
I'm sorry?
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
No, thank you.
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
John who?
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
Preoccupied with what?
I have this effect on lots of women.
Who is it?
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
Hi.
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
I ordered lunch.
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
I saved his life during the war.
You were in the war?
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Can I ask you a question?
Depends on the question.
Thanks for the great time.
What is this?
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
What are you talking about?
What does all this mean?
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
But I've seen the deed.
No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
I'll take you to a game.
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
Act natural.
I think you better sit down.
What is this....
I checked. There was no divorce.
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
I'm calling the police. Right now.
Don't tell me I can't --
Don't worry, I can take it.
You shouldn't be here.
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
Cabana one.
I would, actually.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
Muchas gracias.
The door was unlocked.
Lock's busted.
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
Where is she?
Moved out.
She moved out.
So you're saying she moved out.
I'm her cousin.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
Two...
I never read the paper.
What's the spread on the game tonight?
I don't know.  Look!
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
So let's go! We run the pictures.
How gray?
What about finding the source?
I have some ideas.
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
I want something I can print!
I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.
What?  Who the hell are they?
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
Fletch, you want an apology?
Not really.
Not really?
Jim Swarthout?
Frieda's boss.
Who's Frieda?
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
Mrs. Stanwyk!
But I ain't got you...
But I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Who's your decorator?
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
No thanks.  I carry my own.
Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
Actually, you may take it all now.
Who?
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
Have what?
What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
So what about this watch?
Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
You going to be okay?
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
I don't know, what was the case?
Aha, just what I suspected!
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
Got those Vomit invites here...
Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
How much?
Hey, they blew me.
A simple 'please' would suffice...
It's red, Ford.
You okay?
Let's get serious...
Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
People still watch that?
Zuzu, wake up...
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Ford, you were right!
Nice left you got there, jerk.
This way...
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!
So, Zuzu.  Are you okay?
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
I got something serious to dis-cuss.
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
You need it.
And hey, I appreciate it...
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
So, did you find my dad?
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
Fine!
What's fine?
I'm off it!
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
Let me go out like a man.
Well, hello, Ford.
So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades?
Jazz, we're talking here.
It doesn't have to be like this?
It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
Kill them.  Not quickly.
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
Shit.
You'd said something about proof...
I'm still the king!
You're a poet and didn't know it.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
That's cute.  You're funny.
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
Hi, private eye guy!
Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
This isn't music!
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
'Bye, Johnny...
What's my name?
Doyle.
What?
Mr. Doyle.
I'm clean.
You don't use shit?
No - no.
How's everything?
There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
Boca?
B.O.C.A.
Doesn't register.
Got a wife named Angie.
Who knows?
Where do you want it?
Where are you?
Takin' care o' business, honey.
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
Sal --
What's your name, asshole?
I don't...
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Henri c'est gentil d'tre venu.  Je vous prsente mon associ, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.
Did you pick up the car?
Did they follow you?
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
Allo... Salvatore...
Who's this --
Twelve o'clock... yes...
It has to be by the end of this week.
It's your problem.
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Pour moi?
Le sommes nous?
Are you sure it is dead?
Sale boulot.
Il fallait le faire.
What happens to the schedule?
We must follow it.
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
You're in show business.
I got no music!
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
There's nobody like that on six.
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
Where from?
Des Moines.
Where's he from?
Marseilles.
You want some eggs.
Why not?
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
Yeah!
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
When ya go back on?
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.
How'd I know he had a knife.
Never trust a nigger.
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?
Drink this.
Who is that guy?
Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
Give who a tail?
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
Yeah.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
Timezit?
Same car.
Hey, Bo.
What is that old building?
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
What was it?
It was a crematorium.
For garbage?
Yeah.
You remember Mary Finelli?
You know what I'm saying.
No, I don't.
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
Where's the collar, in the cells?
Switches are shorted out.
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
How do we get to the vault door?
Baltimore?
Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?
It looks open on the other side.
You okay, man?
How about a little of the King?
Damn.
How was your tour?
Butch called.
Did he?
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
I love you, Bud.
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
I'm off.
Honey, what is it?  Just tell me.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
Hey, bud.
Lucky throw, fire boy.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.
I think you know, Frank.
What do you mean?
415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
Next time lets put some money on it.
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
Daddy, I'm scared.
Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.
You ready?
Wait...
Uh, hello?
WB2YKXB, who've I got?
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
Where are you transmitting from?
Queens, New York.
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
Sorry 'bout that.
What'd you just say?
You call your son Little Chief?
What'd you say your name was?
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
What?
What's going on?
What?
You just burned the desk.
That's impossible.
Dad...?
How could this be happening?
You sound...ground up...?
I'm thirty-five years old.
It's really you, isn't it?
No, not yet.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
What's that?
I think I'm losing you.
No wait, don't go!
What are you talking about?
I lost you.
What?
I never knew you, Dad.
Why?
Fire.
That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
When?
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...
Chief?!  Is that you?
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
Are you alright"?
Something happened, something...
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
It's Mom.
What?  What is it?
She's not here.
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
When?
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
What are we like in...1998?
You really wanna know?
John, you still there?
I'm right here, Dad.
You all right?
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
In my pocket.
What...
Please, Dad, just do it.
Dad, what the hell is going on?
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
Go in where?
The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
How you feeling?
Longbranch...?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
You're not looking too good.
Maybe you outta lay off a little...
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
Which means he probably knew her.
Uh, huh.
Got a minute?
Sounds good.
I'm sure everything'll work out.  She really loves you...
So how are things at the hospital?
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
So how'd you like LION KING?
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
You work too hard, John.
She's pretty special.
Are you a good cop, John?
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello."
You used to be on the job?
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
I look familiar?
The 2-3.  Homicide.
A hot shot, huh?
Nah, just working the job.
Where are you going?
Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
What're you gonna do?
Breakfast?
What was that?
Why don't we go take a swim?
Think you can figure it out?
I vote for me.
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
Maybe we should do some exercise.
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
What's the matter?!
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
Will you come with me?
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
What are they saying?
Come on down!
What's this?
Your bed.
Derek... stop.
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
Is that so bad?
I don't know.
What?
Did you stay here last night?
No.  I got here just before you did.
Somebody was in here.
Shelly!  Where are you?!
Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.
It's deceiving.
What happened that night?
Could we move a little faster?
You know him?
Hi.
You're Shelly?
What d'ya got in there?
My whole world.
In that little thing?
Why don't you help us?
That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
Is... is everything all right?
Everything's gonna be fine.
Please... be cool.
Are they following us?
Yes.
I don't see anything.
Got any good ideas?
This is no time to celebrate!
Bullseye!
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
Why do you do these stupid things?!
I have to.
You don't "have to."
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
Go out and plug the cord back in.
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.
Will you slow down?  It's hard enough to read this thing.
Darren, we better turn around.
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
I'm getting real tired of this maniac.
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
Is that all you found?
Whaddya mean?
Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!
You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
Ahh, nothing.
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.
My ass.
Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
Daddy, what is going on?
It's all over.
So what are ya drawin'?
There...Ya happy?
No.
Why?
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
Lake Forest Green?
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
Did you hear me?!
Where'd you get this?
Are they grown-ups?
That's debatable.
But what if they try and scare us?
Which is?
Boy scouting.
Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
What's goin' on?
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
Doesn't that tell you something?!
Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
Well, let's hope not!
The what?
Steven...
I'm here.
I know who you are.
I need to talk to you.
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
No, I --
Twenty.
Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
You need to leave.
I know everything about you, Diana.
Everything going okay?
It's going.
Legs giving you trouble?
Steven buggin' you?
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
I gotta get back to work.
What's the problem here?
Hello...
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
Okay.
Good night, beautiful.
Maybe you should be moving on.
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
For a good reason.
Tell me.
Sorry.
She's beautiful.
Her name's Stephanie.
I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
Randy, you dipshit!  Take these off!
Randy, c'mon!
Okay.
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
Oh, my dear God...
How many times do you want to hear this?
Until I hear the truth.
I know what it sounds like.
You don't know shit!
About what?
No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
A major prick.
What are you going to do?
A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
That was truly excellent.
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
Well...how do you feel?
What's wrong?
Did you hear that?
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
Where's the radio?
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
What's that?
This is Jason's fault!
Jason's here in New York.
Where did you get that alcohol?
That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
I doubt very much that one even exists.
What did you do with Rennie??
There must be a phone around here somewhere.
Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.
I don't think that's such a safe idea
You're telling a lie.
I...I can't...
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
She didn't push me into coming.
You had me worried to death!
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
Get in the boat, Rennie!
I...I can't...
I'm glad you decided to come after all.
Everything okay?
So, are you having fun yet?
I can't swim.
What is your location?
Rennie...
Hi, Sean.
I heard you weren't coming.
I got you a present.
But I didn't get you one...
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
I didn't mean for you to go!
Rennie...??
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
But Rennie...
Rennie...what'd they do to you??
You have to call the police...
I used to drive a taxi.
Very big.
I opened thousands of brains.
What did you find?
You are going where?
Crosstown.
We must abandon.
What do you mean, we must abandon?
We must abandon.
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
Under the Manhattan Bridge.
This is a great young out-of-work actress.
Say it again.
Shut up, Elliot.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
Press a button and they give us money.
She wants a divorce.
Don't talk like that.
It's over, finished and done with.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
Very dangerous.
Asbestos lining.
We must abandon.
I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
Tonight. What's tonight?
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
What was it like?
Is it safe?
Do we care?
I think we Nought to wait.
I say we go.
You say we go?
Do not inhale.
I'm not ready.
Where are you going?
Don't wait Efor me.
He carries a gun.
We're making too much of this.
It's your best play, Nicky.
Keep going west. Last building before the river.
How do you Eknow.
Paisley Porter.
Had to be him.
Great game.
Unbelievable.
What are you talking about?
What are we talking about?
Did you see the winning run score?
This could be it.
This could be it.
Let's work on it.
This could Pbe it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
Does it feel comfortable?
Does what feel comfortable?
This could be it.
You know about Adele.
What about her?
She's dying.
I talked to her two days ago.
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
We're able to surprise each other.
In and out of bed.
Because we're completely mismatched.
It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
It's your best play, Nicky.
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
I go to college. I thought you knew.
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
That's completely crazy.
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
I have a class. I'm late.
What will we talk about?
Will I believe you when you tell me something?
Why won't you tell me your name?
First you tell me.
What else?
Packs an emotional wallop.
What else?
Yes.
What do we want?
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
It's your best play, Nicky.
Your father said you might be here.
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
Opening night, Lillian.
That's always been my problem.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
Joanne Bourne.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
I am really, deeply sorry.
It violates so many trusts.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
Great game. Red Sox are winning.
Life is good.
All the failures, all the fatalism.
Washed away.
What did it say?
A thousand things.
This could be it!
Life is true.
Who is it?
Go way. I'll call a cop.
Pop, will you let me in?
Where the hell are you?
What do you want?
It's me. Nicky.
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
But the son is suppose to stop crying.
You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
Since when did that matter?
Let's not start that again.
My back is killing me.
Where's your elastic brace?
So what are you going to do about it?
What do you want me to do?
Everybody else does. Why not you?
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
Matthew's my grandson.
Now that's a complicated subject.
You see what you're doing, don't you?
What am I doing?
You're charming the boy.
It's a complicated subject.
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
Life is good.
I don't know.
Washed away.
Because life is good.
Don't worry. It's a test.
This could be it!
Then they lost?
Why do you care?
Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
I hate the Mets.
Have to hurry back.
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
Sidney remains optimistic.
Sidney.
I was educated by nuns.
Burnt sienna.
There was a review.
I think I remember.
So does Elliot.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
Oh. You know him.
Endearing.
A little drastic maybe?
Say it again.
What?
You know what.
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
I hear good things about the new play.
So do I. Over and over.
Would you like to meet him?
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
Is what true?
Do you think he can do it?
I don't know.
He's a very sweet man.
Where are you going now?
Home.
Someone waiting for you?
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
Yes.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.
Are you sure?
Everyone takes his turn.
I am your wife.
Please! You're being foolish!
God gave you ten thumbs.
"Take a fifth step, that we may serve the people."
"Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life."
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
What do you expect when you talk like that?
Enough.
What are you doing?
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.
They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.
You mean Gandhi?
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
What'd he say?
I'll take your luggage back, baas.
What can we do?
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
You will respect the law.
You're an ambitious man.
Do you remember much of South Africa?
After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.
Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else.
The fools!  Sorry...
It's split the Government.
Will you have a glass of sherry?
Perhaps some tea?
I dined at the prison.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible?
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out. We have to go back!
How much extra?
Not yet, I'm afraid.
No?  What's keeping you?
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
Don't underestimate these imposters.
Something's not right.
He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.
What are you waiting for?
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
We believe we have a suspect.
Twelve have a mission within the week.
Jerome--?
Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"?
That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
What's wrong with him?
Six one.
You okay, Jerome?
It needs work.
You really need that much?
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?
Who died?
The Mission Director.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!
11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew.
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
It's all right.
Call German.
Any particular reason?
We can't stay here.
What are you talking about?
What makes them think that?
They found my eyelash.
Where?
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
You really had other offers?
I've got enough on my mind without that.
If you say so.  The stripe.
Not thirsty?  We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
How was your evening?
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
Where are we going?
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
Where are you taking her?
Everybody goes there.
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
How are you, Jerome?
Not bad, Jerome.
Why have you done this?
In case you get back before I do.
Where are you going?
First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?
What will happen to the others?
Vincent...Vincent...
German, is that you?
You can wear lifts.
Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
You worried about the cost?
Hugo!  I've found him!
Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?
I was at home.
Were <i>you</i> alone?
Why don't we say we were together?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.
We were just looking.
Have they found our friend?
It was a mercy-killing after all.
They found an eyelash.
Where?
In the South Wing.
Does it have a name?
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
You didn't know?
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
I envy you, Jerome.
So you didn't do it after all.
What about the car?
Let's walk.
My medication.  I left it back there.
--when you go away.
A year is a long time.
What's this, Lamar?
Flight got you nervous?
What are you doing?
The doctor will give you something.
I'm not doing it.
The name?  For the certificate.
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
Sure,  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas?
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
I'll take care of my end.
Hello, McCoy.
Beynon.
Three... Rudy got ambitious.
And you got him...
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
Hello, Doc.
Hi.
You want to drive?
Feel good?
Where do you want to go?
It doesn't look like that.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
What's Beynon got set up?
Where did you get those?
I've been doing my homework.
Just like old times?
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Where did you get them developed?
Assumed name... Houston.
Half a million.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
What do you want for dinner?
How does it taste?
How's Estelle?
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
That's not all of it.
After four years and now the question comes up.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
I guess I'm kind of...
It's all right.
Wait... give me a minute.
Really?
How was it?
I was going to fix you breakfast.
$250,000 right off the top.
Thanks again.  I 'm glad you waited.
I couldn't have... much longer.
That doesn't hurt.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
I didn't. I just waited.
... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...
Promise you won't laugh.
Bullshit.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
What about the bank?
Doc...
Why?
He might be ready to chop us up.
I don't want to go there.
Why didn't you tell me?
Yeah.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
She's on TV.
If you don't start telling the truth... 
What do we do?
A man helped me open it...
And switched keys.
He must have.
How long ago.
I can handle it.
Do you mean that?
There may be a hunting party.
You're full of ifs.
That would be the first time.
When are you going to learn?
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
Where are you going?
How much?
Are you hungry?
No scars?
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
We're going to make it.
I want to say something.
No more about Beynon.
Sounds good.
You want to try with me?
Things can't get much worse can they?
Okay.
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Yeah.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
Come on, come on.
Who was it?
Where do we go from here?
How long before this car's hot?
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
What now?
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
I really hope you have a nice trip.
Hope you get to where you're going.
All right. Shells?
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
Gonna knock down a wall?
Chicago.
You were with him?
Yeah. I got out.
Suit yourself.
Okay. How many bank exits?
Two.
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
Aren't we going a little hard?
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
Just sandwiches...
He took the day off.
Then you do it.
Drive.
How was that?
Just fine.
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
What's it to you?
You serious?
Sure am.
And I keep my mouth shut?
You got it.
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for God's sake keep your mouth shut.
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
You can trust him...
How long have you been married?
Two years.
Can he trust you?
I've got to stop.
Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
Yes.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
When did you find out?
A couple of weeks back.
What did you do?  Albert?
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
Yes. I told him.
What did he say?
You knew what I'd do.
What happened to this car?
What's it got to do with you?
This is my brother's car.
Oh ay?
Well, he drove it into the river.
What about the brakes?
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
How'd it happen, then?
I know.
I made a mistake.
What?
I made a mistake.
What about?
What name?
That's not good enough.
Jack, you're wrong.
Jack?
That's nice.
I can't Jack. How can I?
No, don't Jack, don't.
Who sent you, Thorpey?
Where's he living these days?
What about?
Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?
I must go. I'm in a hurry.
I can't.
How were things between you and Frank?
He was all right to me.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Though nicer than most?
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
Why'd you see him so regular?
Once a week?
I call that regular.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
You know Sid Fletcher?
What?
You know Sid Fletcher?
I work for him.
Do you?
I know him too.
Who?
Sid Fletcher.
Oh, do you?
Yes.
Yes. I met him last year.
Really?
Yes, while he was here.
While he was here. You went about together?
He was here for four days.
Was he?
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
So where are we going, Princess?
To the demon king's castle, of course.
And what was that?
Brumby.
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?
Entertaining.
What kind of entertaining?
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
That's why you waited for me.
Not entirely. No.
I want to give you an Oscar.
You've been watching the film.
Tell me about the girl.
What girl?
The young girl. Who pulled her?
I don't know.
Was it Albert?
Yeah.
Who set it up?  Eric?
Then he must have pulled her.
Expect so.
Did my brother Frank find out?
We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.
Nice of you to come.
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
Look, look.  Get your suit cleaned.
Sorry about your father.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
How's school?
I left last year.
Oh, what you doing now?
Working at Woolworths.
That must be interesting.
You all right now?
Yeah.
You coming to South America?
Where you going to live, then?
At me friend's house.
Where's that?
Did you work with him, Keith?
I mean, what for?
It just would. He was always the same.
Since when did he drink whisky?
Don't know.
You work here, Keith?
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
Where would I find him?
What you having, Jack?
Heard of a man called Thorpe?
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
Nowt.
See you later.
Where you off to?
Who's Brumby?
What happened to you, then?
Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?
I see.
I'm staying with a friend.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
It's not like that, luv.
Are you a traveller?
Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
What is it?
My brother, Frank.
Is he staying the night?
Funny.  Can I phone London?
I'm sorry.
You don't look it.
I'll call the police.
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
Now just a minute...
They came back?
What'll they do to him?
They bloody hurt me.
You're lucky. They kill as well.
Thorpey nearly died laughing.
That little shit!
What about Keith?
What about Keith?
What you going to do?
Pension him off.
You wouldn't.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
What's that supposed to mean?
Are you awake?
No.
Did you sleep well?
Are you tired?
What, and get myself beaten up again?
No chance of that.
Not much.
They're friends of mine.
And that'll make me feel better?
You coming back?
Is he?
Jack Carter.
Eric. Eric Paice.
What you doing around here then?
Didn't you know this is my home town?
No, I didn't know that.
Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays?
No. I'm visiting relatives.
A bereavement. A death in the family.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, well. Small world, isn't it?
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
That's not always a healthy way to be...
They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow.
Eh? Have a drink.
Yeah.
Nasty way to go.
I have to. Things to see to.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
We've got to take you back to London.
Gerald wants to see him first.
Bollock naked with his socks still on?
They do that up North.
Not suede boots!
Knock it off, Gerald.
Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
That's right, Harry.
Three hundred altogether?
All right. Two hundred.
Four hundred?
That's right.
You're not seeing me?
I'll see you, then.
Polacks and deadbeats.
...Polacks...
Deadbeats all.
...they hold on to their money...
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
I had to.
You had to, yeah.  Why?
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
Mmm...
You ever get 'em?
You did?
They came in and they, you know...
They did.
They killed the goose.
They did.
And now...
We're stuck with this...
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
It's too...
It is.
Eh?
I, I...I...
Some contest board...
I...
It's not.
That's right?
Eh...?
...that's right...
He is?
The nurses?
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
What?
Starting up.
Just the act.
No.
You...
You build it!
You fucking build it!  Men come...
They...
They have...
What do you mean?
Somebody...
Yes...?
Should do something to them.
Someone should hurt them.
Yes.
Someone should rob the office.
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
How do you know he'd buy them?
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
No, we're just...
We're just "talking" about it.
As an idea.
No.
Talking about it as a...
No.
As a robbery.
As a "robbery"?!  No.
Well.  Well...
No.  Not actually.
Did you?
You're actually talking about this?
You're going to steal the leads?
Did I say that?
Did you talk to Graff?
Is that what I said?
What did he say?
Yes.
What will he pay?
A job with Graff.
Is that what I said?
He'd give me a job.
What?
You...
I'm sorry?
Dave.
What if you don't get caught?
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
Why would they come to me?
They're going to come to everyone.
No.
Are you sure?
...you don't have to come in...
...and rob the place...
Me?
Absolutely.
I didn't ask to be.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
You went for it.
In the abstract...
So I'm making it concrete.
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
Do you need five grand?
Is that what I just said?
I do?
And why is that?
Can we get some coffee...?
Fine.
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
Yes.
Huh?
Yes.  They are old.
They're ancient.
Clear...
It is dead.
It's a waste of time.
That's...
They stole...
...what am I going to do all month...
To the cops?
A waste of time?  Why?
The cops?
Yes.  The cops.  No.
They aren't?
No.
Why don't you think so?
Where were you?
Where was I?
Was I?
Yes.
No.
You have nothing to hide.
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
Yeah.  You know who doesn't?
No, who?
Thieves.
Why?
They're inured to it.
You think so?
Will you excuse...
Where did Moss...?  I...
Did they...?
You understand?
Oh, God, I hate this job.
Shelly, the Machine, Levene.
You...
That's great.
Wh...wh...Wha...?
...how can you talk to me that... that...
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
Who used to say that?
That they're going to be upset.
Go to lunch, will you...
I want to work today, that's why I came...
The leads come in, I'll let...
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
Just go to lunch.
I don't want to go to lunch.
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
Williamson...Williamson, they stole the contracts...?
Excuse me, sir...
Excuse me, fella.
...did they...
The people downtown said...
Mr. Levene...?
You're done, come down, and let's...
Would you come in here, please?
What about the other two?
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
...no...
...then...
Roma.
Under him?
Murray...
You're saying that I'm fucked.
...and I'm going to get bounced and you're...
Murray said...
Either way.  You're out.
I'm out.
Why?
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
Then put me on the board.
Of what?
And what if you don't close.
Alright.
I'm not sure I have two.
I saw the board.  You've got four...
Alright.
Now?  Now?
Why?
What happened?
The leads are coming.
Yes, I am.
How do you know I made it up?
Well, hadn't it?
You're so full of shit.
You robbed the office.
Five thousand.  I kept half.
Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
It was his idea.
Only the beginning...
I've got the check...
Don't.
I'm sorry.
Why?
Because I don't like you.
John: John:...my daughter...
You did that?
My ass.  I told 'em.  Listen to this: I said...
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
"You do get the..."  Huh?  Huh?
Eight units?
That's right.
Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch...
When?
They took the leads?
Just now.
Fuck you care...?
How was it...?
From the store.
What is it?
I wanted to speak with you about...
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
Uh...
Home...
Home cooking...
The monthly interview...?
You're sure?
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
What?
Kenilworth...?
I'm sorry...?
Me.
Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
Did I...?
What do I...?
Yes.
Three days.
No, I don't know.  Tell me.
Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I can't, you saw my book...
But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
You don't count Saturday.
What would have elapsed?
If we wait till Mon...
Yest...
What was yesterday?
And when was that check cashed?
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.
It's not me, it's my wife.
What is?
I told you.
What's going on here?
Tell me again.  Your wife.
I told you.
You tell me again.
She wants her money back.
We're going to speak to her.
No.  She told me "right now."
We'll speak to her, Jim...
She told me I have to.
I can't regotiate.
What does that mean?
I...
What...?
I...
What...?  Say the words.
What power?
The power to negotiate.
This.
Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
What?
What are the police doing?
It's nothing.
You cashed the check?
Guess what the Machine did?
Fuck the Machine.
You hear what I said?
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
Eight units.  Mountain View.
Fuck you.
Guess who?
You just this morning...
We haven't got a lead...
Why not?
Is that what I did?  Dave?  I humiliated you?  My God...I'm sorry...
What is this, your farewell speech?
I'm going home.
Your farewell to the troops?
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
They didn't get my contracts.
They didn't get the contracts.
Did they...
They got, listen to me...
They took some of the con...
You closed him yesterday.
You did?
Aren't you going out today?
With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift.
Three?  I count two.
We had a slight burglary last night.
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
Yes.
Did you see my present for you?
No, where is it?
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
I know.  How long will you be gone?
Just a few days.
Will you take me?
I can't.
Why do you have to go?
To do business.
I can help you.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
What position did you occupy?
Your friend lives in a fine building.
Fanucci is not connected; he is alone.
Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.
Yes, thank you.
I got surprises for everybody!
We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
You're not my father!
Then why do you come to me?
Is Kay coming?
I want to talk to you, Michael.
What's 'cent' Anne?'
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
Deanna, will you get back into the house!
I don't want to stay here...
Would you like some?
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
You would risk your life for strangers?
I'm not afraid of his words.
He is weak.
He will grow strong.
I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.
Ready, Frankie.
Hey Mike, what can I say?
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
I want you to help me, Fredo.
No.
It was hard to have him killed.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
It was hard to have him killed.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
No.  I mean, are you sure?
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
Beautiful.
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
The 'patrone' is here.
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
That's off now.
How long does this go on?
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
Am I a prisoner?
If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.
He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
Hello?
Yes.
Will you tell him?
Me too, Tom?
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
If you need anything, just...
But if you're wrong...
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
I took care of it.
They can come in now.
Wait... there's something else.
Go on, tell me.
Was it a boy or a girl?
Mike, at three and a half...
It was a boy.
And Kay...she's all right?
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
That plane goes to Miami...
Fifteen percent skim?
It might show.
What's up?
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.
Did my brother go back?
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
You're right.
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
Do you owe markers?
There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much.
And what's the price of their not finding out.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
Is he related to the witness?
This meeting is adjourned.
This committee owes an apology!
Whose orders are these?
Kay.
How's the baby?
Sleeping inside me.
Does it feel like a boy?
Kay, I told you...
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
Are you Klingman?
Who's asking?
Who do you think you're talking to?
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.
No, I meant lose his family.
Nothing is more important.
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
I wouldn't consider anyone else.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
So?
You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.
I just left our friend in Miami.
How is his health?
I know.
When do we talk?
Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.
You were unfair with them.
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
I want you to help me take my revenge.
I want you to settle on their terms.
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.
We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator.  But never think it applies to my family.
We'll try.
On the phone?
Rosato, where's your brother?
He don't want to talk?
We worked it all out beforehand.
Are we going to eat or what?
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
The same assurance we got from you.
You want a war?
I'm talking about Italians!
What about Michael Corleone?
He supports me.
How much more a month?
What was that?
I accept your generosity...
What makes you say that?
Just thinking out loud.
Fuck you.
So what did you think?
What's to be jealous of?
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
I wasn't going to try anything.
Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
It still hurt.  A lot.
You liked it too.
Sure.  I loved it.
Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
Your wife?
Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
You ever been married, Hanna?
Of course.  I am married still.
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
He is dead now, twenty years.
A homo?
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
You did not know?
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
Thanks.  Why do you do it?
What have you done with him?
I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.
You must leave.  You were not here this morning.
Good morning.
Nice place.
And your name is --?
Just that I was in the Marines.
Or would you prefer a beer?
No.  Iced tea's fine.
These are your paintings?
What?  Oh yes.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
"Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and "Son of" and all the rest?
I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
What was wrong?
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
You mean, like posed for pictures?
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
Broke is more like it.
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
Football in college.
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.
You don't say?  Which picture?
I'm not wearing an undershirt.
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
Take a picture, it lasts longer.
We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.
Do you mind?
Did you now?
I liked it.  We all did.
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
Did you kill anyone?
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
Does that surprise you?
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
I'm not, you know.
I never thought you were.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.
I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel.
Not at the moment.
Ah.  A philosopher.
Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?
You first.
I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
Everybody has stories to tell.
What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
There's no people like you in my crowd.
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
You're talking through your hat now.
You were a soldier?
You asked me to model.  Remember?
Good afternoon, Clayton.
If that's okay?
What did I tell you?  Listen.
No.  The girl.
Is that really her?
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
Neither of us really belongs here.
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
Run for what?
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already?
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
That only leaves the rest.
Do I have any other choice?
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
I never made it to Korea.
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
"A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."
I don't remember that one.
I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
Barnett.  Barnett on the wire.
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?
No.  It won't do.
You are much too human.
What did you expect?  Bronze?
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
What was that?
You okay?
Oh Clayton.
Did I hurt you?
Nothing I didn't deserve.
Need some help?
I can undress myself, thank you.
You'll feel better tomorrow.
Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.
I liked it.  You learn stuff listening to old-timers.
You coming, Boone?
Hey, Boone.
You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay.
Sick stuff.  Necrophilia.  I wonder if they knew how sick they were.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
I didn't ask George to invite you.
Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride feast upon her visage.
Jimmy.  How are you?
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Mr. Kay, sir.
I am not forgetting your last brief chat.
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
He is not going to kill the old man?
She is horrible.
You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
Does the yardman come today?
Who was that at the door?
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
One likes to live simply.
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."
Sure.
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
Yes?
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
You're serious.
Quite.
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
Can we talk about the horror movies now?
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
Mr. Whale?  Are you all right?
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
My monsters?
How are you?
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
What are you doing here?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
What kind of job... ?
A boost. A big boost ...
Who was the job for?
Jesus ...
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
I think about that night a lot...
It's about my brother ... Kip...
Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
I'm not interested --
I knew you'd say that.
I'm just here about my brother.
This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
Get out of here, Ray --
One more night --
You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...
Well, that certainly won't do.
I know you --
You know my back -
You want to come along quiet?
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
I know you.
A little family emergency --
I know you.
You know my back.
I'm on the move -
Your girl works in there ...
Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
I know you.
Consider me gone, Detective --
I'll catch you later, Randall --
Double-meaning intended --
What's this -- ?
What's wrong with it -- ?
Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ...
Double-meaning intended, right?
When'd you get to town, Raines?
You seem a little hinked-up ...
How'd it go?
Keys were in it ...
What's the matter?
It's all microchips and shit ...
C'mon, man ...
Donny --
Lookit Kip. All grown up...
What about him?
For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...
What color?
No. That was Higgins ....
Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...
Most of 'em are late-model...
Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?
How's it going -- ?
Dignity...
Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in McO...
Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit..
That's a good one, Donny...
How are we supposed to--
Any word, Kip -- ?
No ... And they won't take my calls ...
How you know that?
Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?
You, too, Ma...
What are you doing back?
Have you seen him?
No.
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
You getting my checks ... ?
What time of year?
You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
Oh, for God's sake
Breakfast brunch -- ?
Any more, O -- ?
Hey, Kip, what's up?
What do you say, Toby?,
You goin' home?
Yeah... You want a ride...
How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
It looks just like a regular Mustang --
Any more ...
Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...
Hey, Kip ...
Kip -- ?
Yeah ...
This has nothing to do with any of that --
You sure you're okay -- ?
I heard you were pumping gas -
Something like that -
Nah. It's a scratch.
Hey, you want something to eat ?
So what are you gonna do?
About what?
Hey, now -
He's gonna kill you -- !
You can handle it?
I can handle it --
You can handle it?
I can handle it --
You?
Me.
You?
You don't think so, huh?
What are you doing here?
"Shadow games?"
Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ...
Thank-you ...
Ain't we good-timing here ... ?
The family that steals together, deals together...
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
What era was that -- ?
The era when crime didn't pay --
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
You okay -- ?
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
Come here --
Come here -
What?
I've missed you, man ...
Toby...
I know ...
You boost her -- ?
Where you off to -- ?
Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
Now what -- ?
Shit ...
What are we gonna do -- ?
Hospital.
He give you an advance -- ?
You know of one -- ?
Take it back, Freb --
Where we going -- ?
Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.
Call 911 -
Call 'em here -- ?
What's with the look?
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
Buy you a drink?
"Mitch?"
On account of Mitch?
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
I left town. I didn't leave you.
A distinction worth noting ...
And you got some Italians -- ?
Hey.
That what you want?
That's what I want ...
You mentioned that in your letters
No ... ?
Ready -- ?
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
Slip it in ...
Unlock your button ...
"Unlock my button" ... ?
The alarms go off ...
I pop your hood; find your siren wires
I do ... I cut "em...
Now... I'm in ...
Of course you are. You're a professional...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
Wrong preposition...
Hear you roar ...
Let me worry about The Club ...
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...
This time it's for real?
What's that?
Hello, Otto ...
You think it can be done?
Are you considering a comeback tour?
And the moral of that story is -- ?
You need him...
Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
What happened to Sway?
Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ...
Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
How old are you now, Toby?
Who's "Eleanor?"
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.

What are you doing here, assface?
Which way's out, man -- ?
Look at Jeannie's kid.
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
Billy, how are you?
Tell him. It's okay.
What did you hear about that thing?
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
No. No. The guy from downtown.
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
Nods again.
Anybody!  You understand?
I warned you a million times.
I've been all fucked up since I got out.

What are you gonna do?
What bag?
I'm gonna need some money.
Henry.  Wake up.
You son of a bitch. She's been here.
Stop! Stop!
We've got to help each other.
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
Who's gonna do that?
Where's the stuff?
You know. The stuff I left.
I flushed it down the toilet.
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
What happened? You okay?
I got seared.
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
What about the schools?
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
Paulie was just talking about him.
It's been six months.
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
Give'm a drink.
I gotta talk to you.
Don't worry about it.
There are cops all over the place.
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
Nah.
It's a fait accompli?
Done.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
I want to talk to Jimmy.
What happened to you?
Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
Where'd you find such creeps?
You ready?
You know what to do?
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
Come on, relax. He's drunk.  He's been locked up for six years.
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
Tommy.  Come on. Relax.
No, no. It's okay.
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
Are you okay? What happened?
I don't need this... You said tonight and now it's not tonight...
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
He's okay. They sobered him up.
He didn't call?
He's with his friends.
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
I got dry cleaning.
You want a partner?
Who's she talking to?
Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit!
Suck my cock!
Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what happens.
I've been shit faced for like two weeks.
Stop brushin' me back!
She's sharp as a marble.
She didn't do it again did she?
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?
What do we got?
When's the arraignment?
What'd you get? You get leniency?
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
Who'd you call?
Why not?
I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride.
How's the woman?
Gone.
Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
Week after I'm twenty-one.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
You and Morgan throw?
No, I had to talk him down.
What class?
Ah, history I think.
Hi.
How you doin'?
How'd you know where to find me?
Oh, right.
Is that true?
Yah, that is a nice ass.
So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
Yah, all right...
How much money you got?
Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
Come on, Will...
Morgan, Let's go.
You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
Chuck, let's go.
Why don't you beat off at your house?
What'd you say about me?
Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day.
I don't think I...Larry?
I have about seventy-three...
History.
How'd you like that course?
Seven.
And what do you see?
You're in a safe place, Will.
Where is it touching you?
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...
Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?
Which one's your building?
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What're you doing?
Hey fuck you.
Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.
Really?
Yes. Under two conditions.
Okay. How?
I think so.
What's that?
Half-red, half-black--
--that?--
--Half-red, half-black--
I told you to cooperate with these people.
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
That's fine, but did you ever think--
It's right.  Take it home with you.
--Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.
What are you smiling at?
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
Find out what?
Good to meet you.
Yeah, cured polio.
How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
Good to see you.
I didn't see you at the reunion.
Since Nancy died.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.
I need someone with your kind of background.
My kind of background?
Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick?
Just meet with the boy once a week.
Can we do it at my office?
I got it.
Would you excuse us?
Tom.
To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?
You're here quite a bit, then.
I live right around the corner.
You moved?
Seems like it's going well.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
--And confuse him--
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
Hello, Sean.
Come in.
Sean...
Where're you going?
I don't know. India maybe.
Why there?
I got one of those too.
How about one now?
Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
What's the point?
What do you want to do?
There is somebody...
Who is he?
It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
I could go for a Whopper.
Well, she out did herself today...
What happened?  You got fired, huh?
So, you finally got a job Morgan?
Like what, Will?
I go places, I interact.
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
Yeah, I read those.
That must have taken you a long time.
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
285.
Yeah. Do you paint?
No.
This is a real piece of shit.
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
--Well, maybe that means you.
Maybe you should be a patient and sit down.
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
Yeah? You got a lady now?
How'd it go?
Well, are you going out again?
Why not?
Haven't called her.
You ever think about gettin' remarried?
My wife's dead.
Hence, the word remarried.
No, I don't.
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
They could see that I meant it.
Would have been nice to catch that game though.
I don't know.
Gerry says the meeting went well.
I guess.
What did you think?
Do you think you're alone?
Do you have a soul-mate?
They're all dead.
Not to me, they're not.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
Don't give me you line of shit.
You want to read it?
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
Yes.
Gotta go with the belt there...
I used to go with the wrench.
The wrench, why?
Oh, I know.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
Don't fuck with me.
It's not your fault.
I know.
That's what you want?
Yeah, I think so.
Good for you. Congratulations.
Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
I just want you to know, Sean...
No. Thank you.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
See ya.
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
Five minutes.
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
Sounds good, where are you now?
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
So you just want to use me and go?
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
No I wasn't...
No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
You grew up around here?
Not far from here, South Boston.
How was that?
I bet you have a great family.
You know, nothing special.
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Bullshit.
I swear to God.
Do you know all their names?
Where have you been?
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
I've never seen your place.
They don't come over here that much.
How's it goin'?
Some, a little.
Just for fun?
Do you play the piano?
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
Will? Are you awake?
No.
Come with me to California.
I want you to come with me.
How do you know that?
I know. I just do.
Yeah, but how do you know?
I don't know. I just feel it.
And you're sure about that?
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
Then what are you afraid of?
What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
I'm not honest?
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
Take care.
You doin' the hirin'?
Will ya look at her!
Ready, Pa?
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
Ready, Ma?
Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'?
Don't hold me so tight.
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
You bust outa jail, Tom?
Naw. They paroled me.
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
People done it. If they could, we could.
Lots must a died, too.
Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl.
She's hotter'n a heifer.
Any gas?
Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll make it?
What'd he look like again?
I didn't see nothin'.
Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.

Want to work?
Sure, but what is this?
That's not your affair. Name.
How many men?
Four.

Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?

Open up! We hear you got a riot.
That's the way it is.
An' you say no cops?
Say, who runs this place?
Why ain't they more like it?
Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy?
Yeah. On my way home now.

Want to work, do you?
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
How about a lift, mister?
Been doin' a job?
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
Naw--not much!
You ain't got to get sore.
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
Yeah.
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
I could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
How 'bout Granma?
Ma. Pa.  Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt.
Where you going?
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
Got any plants?
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
Where you think you're going?
Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
You take this.  I ain't hungry.
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
I like the tent better.
Anybody ask anything?
No'm.
Make her easy, John. Watch her.
Mad, Ma?
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
How about it, Ma?
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
Ma, you sick?
Ya say we're acrost?
Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 
Didn' you get no sleep?
Was Granma bad?
Granma's dead.

Looks like you done it.

She's gettin' prettier, Ma.

Good wages, eh! Pickin' oranges an' peaches?
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
But what about this?
Maybe it's nice on the other side. Them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty.

Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
Can you pick peaches?
You sure you got ever'thing ready?
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
You do not.
You don't...
In the corporate offices.
Oh... really?
What do you do?
You do not.
It's what I do.
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
Marty, you haven't changed a bit!
Bob. Bob Destephano.
What?
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
Bob...
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
Fine, Bob. How are you?
Never better.
What am I gonna do?
What do you want to do?
I want to be an actor.
I just play my own collection.
That's it?
Not much else.
What's your business?
I'm a professional killer.
Where have I been?
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
Are you going to the reunion?
It's always the little things.
Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.
Bad experiences.
You met people.
Bad people.
Watched television?
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
Yes.
Unbelievable.
Seven it is.
Are you there?
Flowers. That's funny.
As long as I get the laugh.
...Let me get my coat.
Do you want to get a drink first?
Shoulda brought my gun.
No time.
Like heroin?
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
Yes.
Not the other way around...?
No.
Is it something you've done?
...About five years now.
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
I was leaving.
That's probably a good idea.
Will you come with me?
What if I come back?
Shouldn't you be taking notes?
How do you know?
I just know.
Yes.
What stuff?
Okay. Repeat this after me.
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
Like a union?
Like a club. Work less, make more.
No harm no foul.
There you go. I left it blank.
Hey, Ken. How have you been?
Hello Martin. How have you been?
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
Have you seen Debi Newberry?
Lisbon?
Well?
That's strictly Bader-Meinhof stuff.
It was the PLO.
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
He using her.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
One cannot love and kill.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
And not show it to me. Ever again.
That's going to cost.
They're not happy, sir.
He didn't.
They blame you for the compromise.
They were very upset.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
Enough?
This is not good.
What's it look like?
It's fine.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
I bought a new rug.
That's wonderful, Mom.
What's a revival tent?
It's a place where religious people--
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
I spoke to your father the other day.
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
You have a headache?
I have a headache. You have a headache?
No, I don't have one.
We had a good laugh, didn't we?
I think I'll go see Debi today.
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
Marty! It's me. Paul.
Paul?
God it's great to see you.
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
No. You drove us here.
He sells BMW's?
He gave me a great deal.
What the hell happened to you?
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
It didn't work out.
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
To shoot you. Correct.
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
I'm a professional killer.
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
You okay?
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
Does Chicago count?
You lived in Chicago?
When I was first married.
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
A jogger, huh?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
Enjoy the day.
Shit.
Need a lift?
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
Thanks.
Feel good?
You missed a button.
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to --
Show me again.
Annie!
I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
Mom?
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
Whatever you want.
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
I didn't know I had to.
Would you like to see that?
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
That's not true!
You buckled up?  You cold?
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
Did you ask him to come visit?
You already did.
Why? There's no food in the house?
Well, one was for salad...
Does anybody out there want something to drink?
I'll take care of it.
Nothing.
About what?
Well...  So you tried riding again?
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
Grace, I don't hate your father.
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
Yeah, you know everything!!
What did you say?
Started what?
My period.
Who's going to want me now?
That's not true.
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.
So do you.
How's everything?
Good.
Great!
David?
Who's there?
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
Did you speak to Farlow?
Uh, yes... Sure, David.
Hi.
I should be in by two.
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
Sure... What's Grace up to?
Okay. We'll see you later then.
I'm sorry.
What did he say?
I should go get some of her things.
We're very lucky.
... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?
Sing it to me, Frankie!
Aw... that's so sweet.
I love you.
You've got to stop doing that?
What did he say?
I don't understand. You just said he said no.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
You've already made arrangements!?
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
What if she doesn't want to go?
She will if you think she should.
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
I miss you, Annie.
Good night.
Everything all right.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
How are you feeling about work?
May I have a suggestion?
Yeah, what?
Take your time.
No. I am a "tubab."
I have so much to tell you.
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
No. He had the choice.
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
Sounds like something Tom would say.
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Good luck to you, Annie.
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
I understand, but Annie, please...
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.
Sure. As long as she don't mind.
When you figure on branding?
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...
Why do you always wear that hat?
Would you let me ride your horse?
Have you talked to Tom about it?
I wouldn't let happen.
She's an editor.
That's not a question, is it?
Can you drive?
I can't...
I don't know if I can with my leg.
I can't... not yet...
Sure?
Grace, I need you to come with me.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
It's warmer than I thought.
You want to go to a movie tonight?
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
Do you want to go around by the old road?
Have you heard from Judith's parents?
No, not yet.
Dad! I can do it, OK?!
You want to watch some television?
What, sweetheart?
Did you notice -- no cane?
I know. Amazing.
IT WAS MY TURN!
Don't be such a baby!
You just showing off for her!
We still have a way to go.
Hey, darlin'.
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
What are you looking at, young man?
How long were you married?
Long enough.
You ever miss it?
Well, that'll happen.
Now that's cool.
Yeah, cool.
You think it's cool?
Secret Service!
Welcome to our show!
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Let's keep her.
What's that?
What's that?
Shit!
Shh!
Right.
Hold on a second!
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
That's far out!
Ta-da!
Snoop onto them...
Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
I want it to have my children!
One-handed!
Cereal.
Yeah?
Go fix the phones.
Who's that?
Curtis.
Dead.
Dade?
Yeah, mom?
I'm taking over a TV network.
Mm-hmm.
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
How was school?
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
Blow me.
The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
I told you, I don't play well with others.
Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
I found it! I found it!
That's Razor and Blade.
How did you know that?
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
What's this one eat?
Oh, shit! He got me.
Yes!
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
Think you can do better?
What the hell is going on?
He's not in this class.
I said give me time.
What?
What the hell are you doing?
It's cool, I'm just looking.
It has a killer refresh rate.
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
Yeah.
Name your stakes.
And if I win?
Make it my first born.
You're not gonna win.
Thank you.
Okay. I'll copy it.
Kate, listen.
Uh, hold on...
Why did he come to you?
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
How?
Shit!!
There they are!
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
Ready?
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
Dade.
Oh, wow, she's great.
You would have looked better.
Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
Gill.
Hello?
We caught 'em.
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
Mr. Belford?
Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
Never fear. I is here.
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...
Joey, Joey...
Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Hey! What are you guys doing in here?
What is he doing in here?
Hello?
Hey, it's me.
A hacker planted the virus.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't want to go to jail for this.
Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
What is it? What's wrong?
Send a Flu-shot.
Thank you.
What number please?
555-4202.
Just one moment.
You're late.
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
Real charmer.
I'll take you down there.
We need to talk.
Okay sure. What about?
What?
My parents baby-sitter canceled.
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
When did you find this out?
Don't get angry.
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?
So?
I don't know Brady.
Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
Are you two okay?
We've been better.
What's going on?
Michael Myers.
Who's that?
Not without Jamie.
You think she stands a chance?
Is there another key?
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
What does that mean?
Shit!
Go!
Brady!
Brady!
Get up there Rachel!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
An accident?
It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
Mom, please
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
Can't you find somebody else?
How do we look?
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
Honey, I don't think their home.
How do you know their not?
Why wasn't I notified?
Why shouldn't I?
How many people in the bus?
Four plus Myers.
Yes.
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
I do.
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
Night Doc.
Got it Earl.
Kido. It's four in the morning.
Do you love me Rachel?
Like a sister?
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
You ready for some Ice Cream?
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
Come on Rachel.
Jamie, what happened?
Come on Rachel!
I thought you said you were ready.
Jamie, wait for me.
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
Can we go home soon Rachel?
Jamie!
Rachel come on.
No.
I can't.
What are you doing out here alone?
We'll hear sirens soon.
Then we'll be safe?
Why?
Hi Rachel.
I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?
You remember Lindsay don't you?
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
I don't want to look pushy.
You won't come on too strong.
Hell of a night.
Its not over yet.
Right here, Ben.
You look sharp. You understand?
132 to 133 this is 134.
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
Get the outside shutters.
Making sure that no one can get in here.
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
I am. Ben Meeker.
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
He's here, Sheriff.
Something?
He's been here.
This is starting to spook me.
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.
Where's that Deputy?
These kids aren't likely to forget.
How far are you going, Mr. Sayer?
Loomis. Haddonfield.
Car trouble?
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!
Okay.
Now you understand?
Jamie! Get away!
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
Hi, Dad. What happened?
What?
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
You're going to be late!
Why didn't you wait for me?
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
It's been totally charted.
We just talked.
Well, are we still on for tonight?
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
Saving the treats for Bob?
I have a place for that.
Look.
He was standing right here.
Annie, was that you?
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
Sure, see you later.
You still spooked?
Probably Mister Riddle.
He can still watch.
Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
You locked yourself in.
I don't want to.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
Yes.
I can't help it. It just keeps ringing.
Fantastic. Totally.
Yeah.
Want a beer?
Yeah.
Is that all you say?
Go get me a beer.
My parents won't be back till ten.
We're all alone, aren't we?
I gotta go.
Will you call me tomorrow?
Yeah, sure.
Promise?
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
Ten minutes.
I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.
Jesus!
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
Isn't that David Graham? He's cute.
Okay. Later.
Hey, Laurie...
Are you coming over tonight?
Same time, same place.
Yes, I am.
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
Not any more.
Why are they under there?
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
What about the bogyman?
There is no such thing.
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
There was no one outside.
There WAS.
What did he look like?
Promise?
Who is it?
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
I'm scared...
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
It's the bogyman, isn't it?
Are you sure?
Yes.
How?
I killed him...
Yes, she is.
Will you get her for me?
I'm not responsible, Sam.
Of course not.
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
PROBABLY going.
What did you use before?
He'll barely be able to sit up.
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
If you say so.
Ever done anything like this before?
Only minimum security.
I see.
What does that mean?
Pull up to the entrance!
Shouldn't we pick him up?
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
Oh, good...
I love that.  That's my type.
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Hi.
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
Are you really interested?
What are your favorite buildings, David?
You want to see some?
Oh, yeah.
Well, let's do it.
That's just --
Yeah.
Uh, who gets dropped first?
Yeah.
And then, uh, April...huh?
I know.  It's terrible!
No, really, I really like him a lot.
Wow, it's the red one?
That's disgusting!
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
Oh, geez, yeah.
Well, I live downtown.
It depends on what way you want to go.
Well, sometimes, some, uh...
Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.
You're joking.
No, he called late last night.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.
Right.
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
We're actresses.
Is this your first job?
Really?  Is the food that bad?
You're Holly.
Oh, what, what do you do?
Yeah.
It's really sad.
And it ruins everything else.
We could...we could do that.
So what's the, uh, problem this time?
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
Now I ca-can't remember.
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
Like what?
Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Hi, Dusty.
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
You--  Standards and Practices?
Child molestation is a touchy subject...
Could you--
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
We--
Like, uh...?
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, Elliot!
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Oh, what, in this section of town?
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
Ohhhh!
How about you?
Yes, I do.
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
Yes?
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.
No!  No...
No?
Uh, yes!
Yes.
Yeah.  How are you?
I'm...all right.
e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Page a hundred and twelve.
Bye.
I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect.
Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
Oh!
I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
Oh, don't say those words!
I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
What do you expect me to say?
Not because of me, I hope.
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
I thought you weren't coming.
I almost didn't.
Lee... uh...
I didn't sleep all night.
This is not an easy situation.
That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
No.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
And you're in love overnight?
They're fantastic.
Aren't they great?
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
She has all the cooking talent.
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
Great idea.
I know.
You bet.
Are you in a bad mood?
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
I don't know.
But, you got four children!
Are you angry with me?
I didn't say that.
Are you in love with someone else?
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
Hi.  How's she doing?
Don't make it worse, Dad.
Oh, Mom!
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
Why should I be afraid?
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
So?
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!
How do you know?
Want some coffee or tea?
How about something to eat?
Are you sure?
Mmm...
Because he likes you.
Me?
Elliot lusts after you.
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
Like what?
Why?
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
No.
Oh, yes, you have!
You've been with someone!
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
I'm saying it now!
So you met somebody else?
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
But who?  Where did you meet him?
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
Look at this guy.
Hello?
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
I can't keep my mind on the show.
Like what?!  What?
But you don't have any symptoms!
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
I think they're fantastic.
Oh, great.
You look so beautiful.
Come on.
Doesn't she look pretty?
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
So how are you?
Oh, me, I'm okay.
Do you miss Frederick?
How are you?
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
Hi!  Hi!
I know...I know.
I got two minutes.
How is everything?
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
He's fine.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
That's really nice!
...you know?  I, uh...
Thanks, thanks.
That's a beauty!
Oh!
Gee.
This is the second opinion.
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
Well, what about artificial insemination?
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
I want to experience childbirth.
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
Hey!
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
What?  You're kidding!
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Holly, please.  Don't insult me.
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
Ohh?
Don't you think she does?
Frederick didn't come with her.
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
Oh, Hannah!
It's, uh, you never know--
He's such a loser!
He's not a loser at all!
Oh, he's such a loser!
Not this Thanksgiving, you know.
Ouch!
Sometimes she's terrific...
Singing?
Yeah, can you believe it?
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
You know.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
Awwww...
Oh, gosh.
You're crazy!  That's not true.
Hey, what's the matter?
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
Well, why don't you share them with us?
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
Don't, no, please.  Will you-- No, don't...
Can we, can we go?
No!
I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
I remember you.
Yes, you do recall, right?
How are you?
Good.  How are you?
I'm fine.
You look wonderful.
Oh, no.
Yeah?
I'd never do that.
...in a really horrible way.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
People change...you know.
So how are you?
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
Have you?
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
No, you can tell me.
Come on.
Nobody ever said it.
No, the reason I ask is--
No, I haven't.
You're kidding me.
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
Well, what about me?
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
Hi.
Hi.  How you doin'?
Okay.
When'd you get here?
Just a few minutes ago.
Mickey?
Mmm, what?
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
Dad...
Oh...
Hi.
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
Take our literature...
...read it over, and think about it.
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
Aren't you glad to see me?
I can't think.
...you don't have to think.
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
A reward...
I'm going to tell you later....
A reward for what?
Some museum director disappeared.
And?
They're offering... 
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
...<u>please</u>...
I have not read you your rights.
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
Or, perhaps...
...how are things at the Hospital?
It's a growth business.
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
Now, whyn't you help us?
We could skip the Gavotte.
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
...aren't you afraid of me...?
You want me to be?
...they did it for a lark.
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
Rich, comic book freaks.
Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
No, you're wrong about Verger.
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
C'mon, pal.
You're ready now.
I'm not.
Then you tell me, then.
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
...the whole world's out to get you...
How you doin?
M'I gonna see you tonight?
Then I'm doing fine.
What's new onna street?
I know her by the Back.
What, What, I can't hear you...
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
How was America?
...nightmare.
They got that kind of money?
...are they hard to get?
Impossible.
Hold up a minute...
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
First things first.
You take this much time over everything?
Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?
Not with any certainty we...
Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
<u>Do</u> it...
Where was the call from.
He escaped...
..It won't be long now, sir...
He don't like popcorn.
No.  And...
I like Popcorn...
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
You give me whatever I want...?
The children...?
...they're from Baltimore....
Now, why in the world would he do that?
What reaction?
Do you know the <u>seller</u>?
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study. 
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
...young boys, still...?
...here's to child abuse!
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
...unmarked hundreds....
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
Let the girl go.
For a consideration.
Sir:
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
...what's he got against you?
Look at this:
...what'm I looking at...?
I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
She threw a punch at a man on the team.
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
What is that supposed to mean...?
I think its meaning is clear.
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
Said what?
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
What'd you say, hon...?
Waited too long, hon...?  
I said how's your baby...?
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
Waal...
A wonderful country...
You know it?
I have had many excellent meals there.
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
...your <u>scar</u>..?
You resemble a figure from the Della Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at Santa Croce.
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they...
I require...
I'd like to walk home with you, and...
...Franklin.
Where do you live?
We got KittyKat...
And you let her get away.
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
I came to pay my...
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
...may be the heat....
Can you walk?  Are your legs working...?
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
Indeed we were.
...and my need for The Institution...
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
And how did he do that?
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
Thank you, Cordell.
...but will that satisfy you?
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
<u>Yes</u>.
You're <u>free</u>...
Look what they put her on...
You should get Married.
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
Because you're going to help me plan a party.
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
What was it.  What was it, honey?
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
...what...?
No.
Every suicide kills two.
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
What would you guess, Ardelia?
You goin to shoot yourself? 
Don't shoot yourself.
Give me your gun...
...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are <u>expensive</u>...
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
No.  Invite us?  No, he simply...
Then we cannot go.
"Because we don't have any money."
....because we don't have any mmm...
...and then, we're going to <u>Greece</u>...
Hello....?
...what did you want? 
I know where he is.
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
I know where he is.
What shape is the scar?
I want the money.
What shape is the scar?
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
...<u>sadly</u>...
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
Thank you.
Or clear your windshield with it.
I know it well.
What're they on about?
They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
Brazilian. 
...a <u>liaison</u> position...
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
...I feel that...
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
Then what brings you back?
No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
Yes.
Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
...would you use a small word?
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
I..
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
You want some <u>advice</u>.
He was <u>shot</u>...he was shot.  On his rounds.  And... and...
And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
Believe me, I wish I knew less.  Oh, if you weren't such a pig...
Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
Now what? What did I do this time?
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
Wha-at?  What is it?
Freeze!  You're busted!
Go stand by the flagpole.
No, they're not from Wendy.
Goodnight, Jasper.
That would be a No.
What are you doing?
I didn't realize I had to declare a major.
I'm not a nai-ive little...
You'll be hiding behind a tree.
I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl.
...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...
What in the hell did you do that for?
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
Oh you know, Bosnia, the importance of the right to vote...
Yes you do.
Yeah. I guess I do.
I think your passion is terrific.
Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
Do you really not believe in God?
What else don't you believe in?
Do you really think we're fooling anyone?
What do you want me to say?
God, you're beautiful.
Sorry Veronica.
Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.
It's not my style, okay?
Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.
Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
Hey really, I don't feel so great.
Oh, I have to hear this.
I'm sorry? I don't get it.
Take a break Veronica, sit down.
So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
Because you're an idiot.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
Because you're an idiot.
Something like that. Will you do it?
Things are going to change, Earl.
I'll think about it.
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.
You stupid cunt!
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
What are you doing here?!
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.
God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something.
Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
Maybe you should see a doctor.
Guess who?
No.
Veronica, you look like hell.
God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
No way, no day!
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
That was seriously warped, Veronica.
Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.
Chick-en.
Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.
And your worst enemy.
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
"I die knowing no one knew the real me."
Mute!
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
Do you take German?
We killed them, didn't we?
I did not want them <u>dead</u>.
Did to.
Did not.
Did to.
Can't you see this is a special moment?
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
You can be so immature!
You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.
You're still not listening! I'm not..
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
If you'll excuse me......
You really fucked me up, Veronica.
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
Let's kick his ass.
Cool off, we're seniors.
Is it sleeping, dude?
I guess.
How was the funeral?
Everyone take their places on the stage!  Isn't this thrilling?!
Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
I adore anything to do with the arts.
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
Come on! Sausage rolls.
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.
I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.
wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
Come on, sit up.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
sighs.
Well, I guess I take after you then!
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
You have to let me go!
You have it.
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
I'm so happy to see you!
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
looks startled at the outburst.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
Oh-what a nice outfit!
Mummy!
She's terribly hurt . . .
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!
It doesn't matter.
I think I'm dying . . .
To be known as He!
Him.
This.
That.
What?
It's so beautiful!
You're such an incredible woman.
You'll never guess what's happened!!
John has fallen in love with me!
How do you know? Did he tell you?
Let's go overseas . . .
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
I'm coming with you.
Mummy!
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
Bye, Dad.
Are you a dream too?
Your insight is enlightening.
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?
Of course, yes.
Hint. It's not a geographical location.
I'm stumped.
It's inside a moving car.
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Second most common?
Skin cancer.
Eighty third most common.
Pitbull attacks.
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
Sure plenty of times.
Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things.
Must be nice.
What?
Yeah, how's that?
I have my connections
Really? Do tell.
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
What's the occasion?
Yeah? You and who else?
Ambrose. I know.
Have we met?
Who's Allison?
What did you just say?
I said she's been missing for-
You could say that.
Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
What's wrong, Trev?
Good boy.  Where's is it?
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
Uh... eighty two?
You win! Okay pull over.
What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
Really, why's that?
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
I don't work here.
What do you want?!
Two.
You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
Are you ready?
Wait... what the hell is this...
... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac.
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
Hey. Can I borrow something?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
What have I done?  I was dirt poor and useless... but I was honest.
I dunno.  It was... an impulse. Me, wearing my good shoes.
Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.
What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What is this?
"Anticipation of incarceration"?
He gives a good report and I walk?
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Often, uh.
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
"The Nomm"?  What's that?
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
Were you in it?  In the war?
You never saw that picture, huh?
Here.  Get off here.
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
I... no... I don't have the right... I...
Vietnam!
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
John, I know all about it.
What're we talking about?  Reach out for what?
We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
What is it?
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
This guy LaPlante won an award?
Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
We're piecing together different accounts and...
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something.
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
Upset!  What's he upset about?
She wants to quit?
It's not unthinkable.
He lost a shoe!
You were in bed.  Weren't you?
Oh my God!  Bernie!
Never reach out!
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
He's pretty... remarkable.
You didn't... get it on with him?
Reporters don't have hormones?
What about?
So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?
Hey, c'mon.
Give it here, Bernard.
So where are all your toys?
Let's watch some TV.
I'm looking for some perfume.
Well, it's for a woman.
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
-- hospital.
Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.
As long as you keep remembering why.
-- a sense of proportion.
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
Well, can I make an appointment?
Oh, great.
Yeah, that was easy.
Do you do washing machines, too?
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.
Yeah, right -- I really have to go to bed.
About what?
Baby, what is it?
I'm thirsty.
It's the middle of the night, sweetie.
A man scared me.
A man?  Was it a dream?
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
Have you just plain asked him?
I could take a cab on the way home.
Has anyone seen Rudolf?  I don't think he came in last night.
Neil, you could have burned the house down!
Neil -- what --
Honey --
Honey, do you want some hot chocolate?
No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
What's that?
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
I know it's at the high end of our range --
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
But it's what we want.
You could have a pool to cool off in.
It's a nice pool, isn't it?
How were we -- were we cool?
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
Did you hear that?
He made, you know, a remark.
How was lunch?
How was your lunch with Charlie?
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
No.
I hear things in this house,
No, I'm not kidding you, <u>Philip</u>.
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
He wants to see me!
Philip!  The senior partner?
His secretary just confirmed.
He wasn't there.
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
That's not the case.
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
Who was that?
I'm having the floor fixed,
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
I think it's time I came home now.
Should I come home when I'm finished there?
It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
How large is your brood?
God, your sister's really hot.
Let's follow 'em.
What for, dickweed?
It's fun.
Shit!
Are we gonna buy this house?
Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!
Neil, do you mind?
I have a cold.
What did the thermometer say?
Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come from, huh?
A <u>man</u> started the fire.
Do you see a man?
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
And this -- is the master bedroom.
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
Is it a king or a queen?
It's a double.
Promise?
I'd like that.
Would you?
Really?
Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
Lieutenant Bedsoe?
What do you think?
You didn't see this.  Understand?
Did you find a sword?  An old sword?
Tough.
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
He had to come from somewhere.
I think it was England.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
Detective Bedsoe.
Lieutenant.
When did you get back?
Where were you last night around nine?
I already told you.  I took a walk.
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
No.  I don't scare easy.
She was a good woman.
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
Yes -- I think it is.
No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
Must you do that?
What?
The river.
That's all?
I'm leaving.
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
Maybe myself.
Thank you, Thomas.
I'm sure they will.
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
France.
What are we doing here?
To ask her to dance.
She's the King's cousin.
Yes.
What worries you?
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
No.  What am I to do?
Well?
I'll go first.
No -- I will.
I stood up first.
That doesn't matter.
It will be a good harvest this year.
Can you really tell from doing that?
What do you think?
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
She's a treasure she is.
How comes it your are not afraid?
Your life.
We had a bargain.  You promised.
The past?
Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
I cannot stay.
Why not?
Why?
I cannot explain.
Do you love me, Conner?
Aye.
Then take me with you.
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
Are you a cop?
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
What do you want?
Yes.  How did you know?
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
If it's good advice.
You're hurt.
Then who's Russell Nash?
Why do you stare at me like that?
I don't have any answers for you.
Who was that man last night?
I don't know.
Do you always walk around with a sword?
I'm interested in mythology.
No.
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
Good evening.
You're twenty minutes late.
You didn't answer my question.
I'm just trying to place you.
You're not an easy person to get to know.
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
Is it?
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
No.
That would mean they'd been trapped in there--
Would you like to see it?
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
Where will you go now?
It will end tonight.
Must you fight him?
How could they get by him?
We found him this morning.
What's that next to him?
I don't think it is a duplication.
It has to be.
You stayed here again last night?
I was working on the cataloging.
It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
I am stronger than you, Highlander.
No.
How can that be?
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
Would you care for some water, Conner?
Don't leave us, Conner.
You kept it?
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
Fine.
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
I think he's dead!
That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
I guess so.
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
You get anything on Smith?
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
You think we should take that chance?
The car.  All you want is the car?
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
That woman's gonna call the cops.
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
It's over.  We have to give up.
Then we might as well die rich.
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
How about the cop?
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
Talley?
What?
The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
Okay.
Let me come get him.
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
Who else is here?
Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
Use more ice.
What about my father?
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
We can take it with us.
The cops are comin'!
I got the gasoline --
What the fuck is that?
Donuts here any good?
Are you out of your mind?
Give me an ETA.
What if it goes south?
If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
What hospital?
Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
Where is it?
Can we talk some more when you get here?
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
I'm scared shitless.
Ow!  Shit!
No one's coming.
That big asshole nailed my windows.
You leave that gun alone!
Want one?
What do you want?
Kevin left without you.
You'd better get out of here!  Kevin's coming back!
Please get away from me.
Thanks for the shirt.
Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
Are civilians inside?
He said something about a girl --
We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
What are we going to do about Mike?
What's going on?
Smith!  Wake up!
Just one question.  Please.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
That's enough.
That's not enough.
Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered the door.
Louise?
Louise?
I know the one.
Chief, base.
I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
You have her cell number?
Did you find Jane and Mandy?
What's wrong with the radio?
He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
Excuse me?  <u>You</u> requested our help.  You turned over command --
I want to know what in hell you're doing.
Let it go, Captain.
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
Chief, Mikkelson.
Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
Are all of you named Jones?
What's my name?
We've got to get those kids out of there!
The kids are in here!
How about you and your sister?
We're okay.
Where are you right now?
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.
Who is it?
Are the disks still in your room?
Where are my children?
Did you find the disks?
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
Who are you?
These disks . . . where are they?
You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
What do you mean by that?
Paul, Paul, a moment please.
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
We, who is we?
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
What is this about?
You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
Please, I don't use guns.
How much?
Name a price.
Ten thousand francs for each one.
How many in your family?
Ten.
I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
Have you requested re-enforcements?
Yes we have.
What was the response?
Paul, you know who this is?
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
Their people?
They fired a rocket at us.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
Will you protect us.
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
Satellites.
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
He did.
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
Where are my supplies?
We must go to the Diplomat.
Get in.
Your police are at the gate?
What do you mean, General?
When?
Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
We are better here.
You are a marked man.
I am on a list! What list?
I led no massacres.
You think they will believe you?
You will tell them the truth.
Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
) You cannot kill them all.
Holy shit! Holy shit.
Here, have a sandwich.
When will they be here?
Very soon.
There are no more rooms.
Mr. Manager.
Get out of this room and get back to work.
Where are we going, sir?
For supplies, you drive.
The fog is too heavy, sir.
Are you sure this is the river road?
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
They moved you from the Diplomat?
Can we phone them in, Paul?
Perfect timing.
I would never do that.
This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
You are the manager?
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
What do you want?
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
The commander is not here.
He will be here.
Excuse me.
Our cards, please.
What cards?
How much?
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.
I will need a suite.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
Your brother's here?
Thomas wants advice?
He wants your wisdom.
No.
I couldn't help.
The president has been murdered.
Where are Thomas and Fedens?
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
Please, Paul, 'til first light.
Oh, my God!
What is it, Paul.
Paul, don't let them die.
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
This won't do.
No, Odette says he's in shock.
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
They are being evacuated.
You could leave, Paul.
Go to the roof now.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
So where is the lamb?
Go out! Where?
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
It was substantial.
Tell me what it was.
A car.
I want to know.
A Volkswagen.
I will not leave without the twins.
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
I have to stay.
Let me go. Children get off.
I love you. Keep the children safe.
We are almost out of water.
The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.
I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
Rutaganda's place?
You have taken business class?
Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.
Twelve are dead.
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
He has taken the presidential suite.
What are you doing?
Where has all our beer gone?
How much beer?
When?
What is this about no water?
All. What do you mean all?
The staff, the guests.
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
No, I don't want you going on the street.
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
There are soldiers.
Where?
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
What is his room number?
I don't know.
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
So what stopped her?
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
And how the hell are we going to do that?
Jesus H. Christ!
Looks like we're it.
Melissa!
What?
Three times, to be exact.
Where is it??
This thing's going nowhere.
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.
-- I did: down here.
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
What's in there?
-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!
What's down there?
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
Oh. Jesus.
Uhhhh...
Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
If you know where it is, get there!
Pritchett, is that you?
Pritchett!
I'll meet you down there.
Prove it.
Is she...alright?
I'm better than that.
Most fun I've had all day.
Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
I don't think so...
What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?
You hear somebody?
We can do it...
I was upstairs with Eddie --
-- that's the fact, bud --
-- you lose either way, Price --
Good point.
Cheery looking bunch.
That's crazy!
This is the best we're gonna do.
It's okay, everything's okay now.
Don't think it's even an issue.
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
Where did it go?
Run.
What?
...Jesus H. Christ.
Could we have a word?
-- just not always in the sexual sense.
You're hurting me.
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?
Where is she?
-- I pose you the same question --
If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last --
-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
Evelyn... Get up... NOW!
Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
You think this is fucking funny??
No, no, it's just --
What?
...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?
Your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it."
And then what happens?
Please! Something! Oh-God!
-- even if I give you a million as well?
-- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.
He was right! Pritchett was right!
What is it??
I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.
I was upstairs!
I'll take my chances.
-- listen to me, goddamnit --
Then tell me, please -- help me...!
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Please! I need your help.
Houston, I think we may have a problem.
Problem where? Looked good to me.
-- it wasn't me.
Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
Wish I could take the credit, but --
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
Of course he did, for God's sake.  Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?
Oh, no.
Don't know that it does.
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
Won't do any good.
Blackburn's dead.
Price!
Pritchett: what is going on?
He must've unsealed the room!
-- hey! --
-- Eddie!!
For the love of God....please...?
Sara...?
Keep talking, I'll find you!
-- I'm coming --
I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...
What was her name?
It might have been her mother.
Town records are coming up now.
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
It looks delicious...
Did you find her?!
Are you all right?
A few years older, perhaps.
It will heal.
I'm sorry.
By killing them?
By freeing them.
Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
Can I do it again tonight?
Don't play games with me, little girl.
I didn't do anything, mommy.
Maybe it was Colleen...
It's going to hurt us!
Can you talk to her?
My angel!
Are we leaving mommy?
Where are we going to go, mommy?
We're going to go someplace new.
What about all my other stuff?
H-how long will it take?
Your father doesn't love us anymore!
She says she's lonely...
She's here.
Where is she now?
She's down.  Help her...
Help me!  Please!!!
Can I have this room daddy?
Sure.  Did you see the others?
What's he doing daddy?
He's blessing the house.
Why?
Look daddy!  It's empty!
Mommy please help me!
Oh my God!  She's in there!
Are we going back to California daddy?
Good night Angel...
Oh come on...
What will Aubrey think?
It's just going to take a while.
To our family.
I wish I knew more about her.
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
...set up some more things.
The heater's here.
What is it?
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...
So what are you saying?
But do you agree with me?
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
Well, I try to keep an open mind, but...
Oh come on!
It just disappeared.  Literally.
Whoa there...
What are you talking about?
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
How are we doing?
I think everything's ready.
Oh my God where is she!
Aubrey!
It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?
I'm fine.
Maura, what is this!
Maura!
Are you all right?
You're bleeding.
Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
Maura.
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
You must be a Londrigan.
Oh, that's nice...
Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.
Concentrate!  She can hear you!
She's coming back.  Keep talking!
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
Thank you.
This isn't happening...
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
How long will it take!
Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  Maybe some kind of a rodent.
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
Where did you find this?
Do you mind if I borrow it?
There's something in there.
What?
There's something through that wall!
Right.  Like last night's doozie.
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?
So where is it?
It was off the statue.  In the club.
Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
What is it?
Why are you so interested?
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
That's great.
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
I'll boil some water.
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
How have you ... ?
And he still sits there?
Every day.
Would you know this store again?
Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
Terri?
Buying some drugs, alright?
For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
What am I looking for?
No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ...
What else came with it?  Anything still here?
Can we see?
You gonna buy?
You're JP Monroe, right?
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
Wow.  Thank you.
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
How do we start?
Joey?
Not quite.
Really?
I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.
That was beautiful.
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
Eighth room down, babe...
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
That's your definition of "Hard?"
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
Alex, did you know this ape was going to be here...
It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....
The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last time I played the game, Simpson only had a 40.
This isn't funny.  I'm not into this.  I...
There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
"A mule is an animal with long funny ears."
"And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo."
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
We're going in from the ground floor.
Count of three?
Why not just go now?
Now that's a lock.
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
That was close....
Anna, I think you better stay....
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
Welcome to Rome, sir.
My life is not some deal.  I...
Welcome back to Vinci.
Don't you just hate kids...
What the hell....
A little petting is not the issue!
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
Tough guy.  What are you--How's your head.
Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....
Prison?
I was the Warden?
How long were you in?
What have you been doing?
tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.
Trust Leonardo....
Cat got his tongue?
What's your favorite sport, Hawk?
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
No, let me!
Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
Yes.
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
Get away from there, convict!
Don't be stupid...they...
Bastard!  If you were a true American.
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
I'm supposed to fall for that?
Why does this have to be so hard...
We'll call it the Flying Donut!
The Dancing Dingus!
Something short.
Sharp.
Snappy.
With a little jazz.
The Shazzammeter!
The Daddy-Oh!
The Hoopsucker!
The Hudswinger!
The Hoop-dee-doo!
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
He didn't offer you money.
A sawbuck!
Ol' satchel-butt...
What a horrible little person.
You're from Muncie?!
-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!
...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?
...You know! For kids!
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
I know that, Amy.
...Huh?
You know, on farm route 17.
Oh yes! In Muncie!
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
...You son of a --
Norville!
Phony, huh?
As a three-dollar bill.
Muncie.
Watch it, Archer --
You can't print that!
Terrific.
Tell me about it.
I got big ideas, though!
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
How long've you been down here?
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
What the heck's she doin', Lou?
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
This I know, Benny.
...Geez.
...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
My pleasure, sir.
...Why, this is worthless.
Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
...You don't?
But, Buzz --
But, Buzz, you know I never --
And Sid says you stole it!
Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
...This'll only take a moment.
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
...Who let you in?
...education, were you?
Well, I'm a college graduate --
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 'Lamebrain'?
No, sir.
Not even behind your back?
You're fired.
But, sir! --
But --
My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
My God! The Bumstead contracts!
I got gas, Bennie.
Yeah, tell me about it.
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
Ya get the special?
...Enter the dame.
There's one in every story.
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
She finds him.
...and awduhs a light lunch.
...No money.
...He's not noticing, Benny.
Maybe he's wise.
He don't look wise.
Yellowstone.
Old Faithful.
Hello, Niagara.
...Her mother needs an operation...
Maybe he's wise.
She isn't!
She's good, Bennie.
Good morning, miss.
She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
Where?
At the Houmfort.
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
I think you need some help.
I'm afraid so.
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
You don't believe in it?
She can never be cured?
I've never heard of a cure.
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
You're single?
Yes.
Where were you trained?
But it's so far away...
Thank you.  But who sits there? 
I went to school in Buffalo.  Paul went to school in England.
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
But don't you have to work?
Bring me another, Ti-Joseph.  I have to keep the lady entertained.
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
Don't let it bother you so, Wes.
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
It is not beautiful.
Have the servants made you comfortable?
I heard someone crying -- a woman --
I am not a frightened girl.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
A mental case?
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
I suppose so.  Yes.
And charming?
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
I heard you playing.
Don't take it to heart, Betsy.
I wanted to help you.
She was beautiful.
I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
You want that?
I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.  It'll pass.  We've had this sort of thing before.
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.
You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?
Got a meeting uptown.
Right o'.
Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
OK, OK, the defense rests.  Want another?
You're staring at me.
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
Good night.
The Halfords have invited us again this year.
You want to go?
What do you think?
I'm, uh, going to bed.
So early?
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
I do. I'm -- are you...?
I... I think I am...
The turkey in?
Dinner in ten minutes.
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
Yeah, that one.
What's for dessert?
See for yourself.
Don't start.
You think I --
I have no idea.
What do you mean?
Elena, what are you're talking about?
It's a starting place.
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
You've...
This just isn't the best moment for this.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
I'll drive you --
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
The phone's out.
Yeah. Well, we can just --
So how's school treating you?
All right.
Classes?
Grades?
Anyone special? You know...
Sure dad.
See you.
Libbets. Libbets Casey.
Ben--
Huh?
Birth control.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
A prior engagement overcame me.
Good-night dad.
What you been up to?
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?
But...
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
It's what?
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
Thank you Janey.
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.
You okay?
Sure. Maybe coffee.
Hi mom.
With Mikey?
Who?
You're not a psycho!
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
They need the money for my band uniform at school.
I don't like coffee.
Please don't.
It's not a bother.
It's really quite all right.
I used to know how to cook.
Social work?
How'd you know?
Yes, it was -- I ended up --
They say you never forget.
Forget what?
You ask what the point is?
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
But not too ashamed.
Now you are being rude.
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
See ya.
How can you do that man?
Aha! I could sense the vibe.
What do you mean?
Huh?
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
Awesome sleet and rain.
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Hey.  I'll take this stuff.
You going to tell dad?
No!
Great, thanks for the tip.
Frankie opens them with his teeth.
Well, uh, I don't, it's really --
Yeah but you don't even know me really.
It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
Who said so?
No one.
Mikey?
Yeah?
Why are you so good at math but not in English?
Out.
Want some gum?
Did you tell Sandy?
I don't ever want to see you.
You have to follow me?
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
I don't know.
Why did you -- with Sandy?
I don't know.
Wow!
When worlds collide.
Huh?
You're parents at that party?
Yeah. Yours?
You get in trouble?
Hello, Charles.
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
With who?
Hood residence.
Charles, what time is it?
Is this Charles?
What time is it?
Hey Wendy.
Hey Sandy.
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
What are you doing?
Yeah.
Are you his girlfriend?
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
Communist Viet Cong.
Vodka?
It feels warm.
One more shot?
I love you.
That's nice. Are you drunk?
I don't know. How do I know?
Yes, sir.
Didn't want to miss anything.
Just after Leland Street.
What's the D.A. got them on?
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
Will, you can't blame yourself.
I had him!
You did your homework, Officer.
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
Typical seventeen year-old.  She went to a party Friday night?
We already did.
Do it again.
This murder was in the papers, right?
She your only sibling?
It's legitimate.
I know.
What about your shoulder?
Sorry about...
He would have liked that.
What I saw?
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
What time was that?
Who was the last one to see her alive?
What are you doing here?
I'll call him now.
Forget your pager?
Where you signed this?
That's right.
How do you mean?
Randy Stetz?
Eight years.
What do you want to talk about?
You know my plan of action.
You know I remember that.
One word to I.A. and he walks.
Well her mother didn't buy them for her.
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
Your friend's all business.
That's not what he thinks.
Will...I...
Did you love her?
Huh?
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
Stuff.
What kind of stuff?
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
The other guy?
I told you I don't remember.
How should I know?...
Ran like hell to go to him...
You don't know.
Thought I smelled something.
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
I was her best friend.
Best friend?
Since grade school.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
You want me to take you somewhere?
Hey...
You and Kay were like sisters?
I don't know.
You don't know.
She wouldn't tell me!
Who?
My arm!
What was it?
No game.
Thought you might find that.
Down at the station?
She was only seventeen.
But she was an attractive girl.
I suppose.
No.
But you wanted to.
You gave her gifts.
Yes.
What about him?
Randy Stetz is in jail.
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
There's nothing more to talk about.
I told you that was an accident!
Then so was mine...
Yes.  Like that.
This an accident, Walter?
Where's your back-up?
No back-up.
Monstrous.
Yes, and very beautiful.
We had feared we were the only ones...
Are you the leader of tis group?
So you have the answers...
Ah! You have questions?
Nothing if not vampires...
Who made us what we are?
That is a picture, nothing more.
Then there is nothing.
And perhaps this is the only real evil left...
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
I was waiting for you...
Your lover.
She is.
That's what the one who made me said.
Where is she? Where's Claudia?
Not without Claudia. Where is she?
And yet you knew what I would o.
I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
Why always on this night?
I didn't realise.
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
And if I cut my hair again?
Stop her Louis!
Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
Don't Louis --
Louis, put me in my coffin...
I want more.
How did you learn to write, Claudia?
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
He jests.
Claudia! You did that?
We're immortal. You've always known that.
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
Louis, look at me.
It can't be -
The ship is sailing wihout us!
How do I look?
Or her, or her - or any of them?
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
This is monstrous!
Do you think I would let them harm you?
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
So you felt it too!
He can protect us, Claudia.
But if she dies...
They would have killed you -
Then my luck would have changed.
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
Give it to me!!!
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
How do you mean, start?
Let's call that a start.
I can't do it.
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
You really want to be with them?
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
Did I hear a yes?
You're sure?
Come, you're going to feed now.
Take him.
The crucifix -
What have I done?
Dear God, what have I done?
I know. It gets cold so fast.
But how do you know?
Read her thoughts.
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
The girl, Lestat -
NO!!!
She's here, your wounded one.
What are you saying?
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
No... You come back to me Louis...
Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
I have to go now Lestat...
It's just a room...
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
You said the slave had a crucifix...
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
The story about stakes through the heart?
What about coffins?
You loved Yvette...
But why did you tell her?
How could I not? She had to know.
No... it can't end like that...
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
And the child who did die?
What can I do for you?
You're in 201 and 202.
What about a radio?
Sorry. Emergencies only.
Listen to me. He's here.
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
Stupid. Stupid.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
I thought you were out of town!
There's nothing between Will and me.
No.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
I'm the King of the World.
Hello? Hello?
Karla! You promised.
Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
Karaoke -- perfect.
Don't even think about it.
No way.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
Karla!
There's no way to lock it.
I'm holding your hand!
No, you're not.
Oh, god, it's you --
You're okay. Thank god.
I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?
Yeah.
Ray, I can't...
Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry.
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
I love it here.
Checking the locks again?
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
Who?
Voodoo.
Don't kill me --
Julie! Wait! You okay?
I'm fine.
You sure?
I'm fine.
To get out of Southport?
I'm okay.
This was not my idea.
You sure it's okay with you?
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
Julie? What's wrong?
What do you mean, Julie?
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
What? What are you talking about? Where?
There was a body! I swear it!
Come on. We're gonna be okay.
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
He's in it with Willis?
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
Is there a problem here?
Oooh, the mainland --
Guess the capital of Brazil --
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
Julie, is everything cool? Karla said...
Ahh, that feels great.
Why? He can't help us.
Well, I'm in school and --
Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?
Rio de Janeiro!
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
Jeez, that's a full carat --
Well, there's some flaws in her...
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
You guys lost?
What's the matter, boy trouble?
Not anymore.
He leave you?
And so could you -- crazy fool.
You stumbled into my hiding place.
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
How's the water?
Take this.
We'll only be a second, okay?
Where'd Estes go?
What is up with that weirdo?
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
) You feel the symptoms?
Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.
No.  She shall not be left here.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
Good night, Oliver.
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
Oh, no - it's too delicious! You're making it up!
Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
Poor child. These must be horrible days for you.
Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
She has never mentioned her family.
What are you doing?
Shh it's all right - I'll be all right.
You are fortunate in your father.
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
What is it -- what are you talking about?
I have forgotten it, dear.
But one must love a father.
I felt he did not like me.
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
You were father's secretary - I never thought - -
You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you - I'll warn them against you.
No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.
Her name is Thea?
Theodosia.
Your daughter is ill.
She's not too well.
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
Do you mind if I go with you?
There's no one there - nothing but the caves and the dead.
There is something evil about her.
It makes me fear her.
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay.
But the war, the army  they need you.
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
We still don't know that it's the plague 
Thea is so like her  in every feature 
Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle -
Listen to what I say --
You're crying. Why?
I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
Please.. You shouldn't laugh --
Well, tell, him.
I can't.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.
Get that ladder up here.
All right  all right.
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
Good morning, sir.
Carter  bank examiner.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Go through with what?
Oh, no.
Well, who are you, then?
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
What?
Clarence . . .
Yes, George?
Where's Mary?
She's . . .
Well, naturally. Of course.
That's your problem, George Bailey.
Who is it?
What's that book you've got there?
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen  that's Violet Bick!
I know. I know.
Hey, Ernie!
Hiya, George!
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
Is this the place?
That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
Oh  Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
On V-J Day he wept and prayed again.
Well?
Mother . . .
Well, sure I do.
Hi, Daddy.
Well, what happened to you?
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
There it is, good as new.
Will you try to get some sleep?
It will?
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
Hee-haw!
What boat you sailing on?
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
Goodbye, everybody!
Oh  Welch. That's what I get for praying.
Oh, no  you don't feel so good.
I'm all right.
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Uh-huh.
Came back three days ago.
Hmmmm . . .
Nice girl, Mary.
Hmmm . . .
Oh, stop that grunting.
Sure  Sam Wainwright.
Hmmm?
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
George! George!
Is it a charge, sir?
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
Aw, get going!
No . . . No . . . No. . .
Aw, forget it.
Oh, it's wonderful.
Yes, you bet.
You want a martini?
Okay  all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
Well, no younger than I was.
Maybe you were born older, George.
Still after that first million before you're thirty.
Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.
Got a match?
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
Oh, am I glad to see you.
Hello, George, how are you?
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
Two cents worth of shoelaces?
Hey, George . . .
Hello, Violet.
Hello, Georgie-Porgie.
What gives?
Nothing.
George, can I see you for a second?
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Say hello to New York for me.
Yeah  yeah . . . sure I will.
Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?
Some other time, George.
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
Hello.
Yes, hello? George . . . it's Potter.
George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there.
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
Now look, did you buy anything?
Pop!
I'd like to do that.
Yes, sir.
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
Made up your mind yet?
With coconuts?
Me?
I'm not very good at this.
Neither am I.
You may kiss my hand.
Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
In that place?
Oh, no.
Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.
How's that?
Have you made up your mind?
When did you get back?
Tuesday.
Where'd you get that dress?
Would you rather leave?
No, I don't want to be rude.
Oh . . . yeah, yeah. That's all right.
Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.
George . . . George . . . George . . .
After that, who cares?
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .
Please, let's not stop, George.
Have fun.
Hi.
To keep from being an old maid.
Is it snowing?
Yeah, just started.
Where's your coat and hat?
What is it, a sore throat or what?
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
Where're you going?
Mary! Mary!
Oh, George, George, George.
You have no idea what's happened to me.
Huh?
You forgot something.
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
How about that one there?
How fast does this go?
With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
You can?
Come on, you guys.
For me...?
Great!  Find one for me.
Wheee!  Faster!
How fast is enough?
My hair's getting wet!
When do we get to the lighthouse?
I can't wait to get there.
Sure you do -- you win either way.
Someone pop your balloon?
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
It's okay, it's okay....
Bring her to port a little.  That's it -- steady.
Don't!
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!
Get on the rocks!
Yeah, it's her job.
No.
Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.
Maybe by now they are.
Turkeys!  Eat wind!
Your dad must be really pissed.
We better go back in.
Putz -- that won't be for hours.
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.
Why'd they decide to move?
What is it?
Where're we going?
But the island!
We're carrying weight.
Coming up!  Give way!
Loser sails home alone.
Throw it.
Coming up!
I thought you said she was going with us?
Let's just go sailing, okay?
Want to talk about it?
You coming up on him?
How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?
Hey!
Sean!   Catch the rope!
We're hung up here.  Snagged.
Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
No!  It's still there!
It's still there!
Good morning!
On your own time?
I just made it up.  It means, "Get me out of there."  What the hell's that?
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
We got a helluva tide this month.
Chief?
What about that camera?
I know just where to go.
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.
I can't let you take her out.
Untie that rope.
You're too close.  Back off.
I'm going out there.
Where to?
Every day?
Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
You stay here a minute.
Oh, c'mon.
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
Michael.
I got something for you to do tomorrow.
I kind of had plans....
Pop.  I'm sorry.
I passed out, but I'm okay.
Sean's still out there.
What else you got?
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
May I have this dance?
Wait a minute....
Look at that:
The whale's mouth?
The Shark's mouth.
We don't know that, do we?
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.
Carcharadon Carcharias.
That's it.
Okay, so that's it.
Is there one in these waters?
And sound.
Where the hell were you?
Do I have to talk to those two?
Why?
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
Listen -- what are you doing later?
Fooling around?
Let's get the kid home.
Mmmm.
Sean's awake.
Door's locked.
Mrs. Silvera?
Need a ride?
It's good with coffee.
Eat Cheerios.
Where's my day book?
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
Oww!
Careful.  What's wrong?
Nothing.
That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
No.
It was bad, wasn't it.
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
Are you going to be able to sleep?
Sean's asleep.
What?
What'd I say?
What're you doing?
What is it?  What's the matter?
I'm showing summer rentals.  We got a helluva season going.
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?
Did he raise the Kids?
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
Did you say Cable Junction?
That's what he said.
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.
Some people.
Can I go with you today?
Hi Dad.
Hang on!
They made me go with them.
Is that me?
That's you.
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
What's wrong?
It killed her.  It ate her.
How old is your cousin?
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
Waiting for Andy.
I want you to meet my cousin.
Mike!  Are you going out?
Did you ever see a dolphin?
Terry!  You okay?
Help!  Help!
Get a dance yet?
Nope.
Me neither.
Who'd you ask?
Tina Wilcox.
Shut up.
The wind drift is lateral.
Come on back up here!
Nope.
Give me back my hat!
Just like this.
The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light.
They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
But first, a little juice....
And second?
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
Right after, the Kids went out?
Be careful....
How much longer?
About damn time.
Power line.
Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
I'm not sure I can.
Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
I thought you were grounded.
I don't care.
Faster!  Faster!
Heading back?
Not tonight.
Who wouldn't.
They're turning around.
I don't need you.  Andy's here.
You always go with Andy.
Do I have to play with the little kids?
I want Fruit Loops!
You're going out.
You're going sailing.
Maybe.
Take me.
I want to go with you!
Quiet!  Shhh!
Michael....
Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.
Yeah.
Brody's riding his tower.
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
Oh, my God....
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
Be reasonable, please....
Go on, you're tired.
Absolutely.  Good idea.
With those camera lights and...
I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.
I'll need more men to look.
It's Miller time!
You buying?
Sure am.
Yeah.  Down there.
Aren't you suiting up, mate?
Well, don't worry about your fiancee.  We'll watch over her.
She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
Well, not much longer to go.
What is it, 97 days?
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Hope I make it through both.
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
Pre-opening jitters.
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.
Yeah.
My imagination isn't that good.
Honey, I gotta go.
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
And what else is bothering you?
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
Yeah, you really don't like him.
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
Not enough loving.
Where's the rubber band?
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
What do I do now?
That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.
Honey... you all right?
No.
Are you scared?
Hi, baby.
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
They just wanted to say hello.
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
It's romantic down here.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
What's wrong?
Where are you going?
Up.
And leave me down here???
You're going down there again?
Yes.
After what happened to us?
Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's your designer?  Sassoon Shark?
Here.
Kathryn...
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Change your mind?
You want me to stay?
Finally.
How's your patient?
Recovering nicely.
Mmmm... you smell good.
No, we'll go through here.
... Mean through the tubes?
Yes.  It's faster.
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
... He ought to put him in here.
It's too soon to move him.
So tell Calvin.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
Honey, what is it?
Hydrophobia...
Michael, take deep breaths.
Come on.
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
Somebody better get down there!
Come on!
That's right.
Who's going to do it?
Michael, you're not going down there.
Michael, you don't have to go down there.
I want that shark, Kathryn.
You don't have to prove anything.
Are you okay?
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
Fine.  Have them do some.
Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
I can have them walk backwards.
No, no.  That won't do.
Unhappy combination.  Most likely one's inside the other.
You can get killed!
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
I want that shark alive.
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
We're taking that shark alive!
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
Should be coming out of it soon.
Thanks for helping.
I like it when they wake up.
So do I.  But for different reasons.
You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed.
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
Some miss all their shots.
I think that you and I are natural enemies.
Hello.  I think his nap's over.
Get ready to go.
Believe me, I am.
Well, Doctor.  You've got your shark.
I've heard of a White that big, in Australia...
He's big as a bloody bus!
She, Mister Hutton.
I think they'll come out now.
They still seem nervous.
He's a young one.
When did this happen?
Don't blame yourself.
Give me a ride?
Sure.
Musclehead?
Sure.  No problem.
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
Hi, Mike.
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
So, you just get here?
Massachussettans aren't.
'Course they're also so rich.
How long you staying?
I don't know, it depends.
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.
You gonna work at The Kingdom?
Depends on big brother.
I'm a water-skier.
Are you really?
Well, I needed a cold shower.
You were great out there!
Herpes?
I don't know, what else is there?
The one that goes underwater?
Yes, it's great!
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.
Isn't this fun!
Told you you'd like it.
Now what's this do?
No...  It can't be.
Let's go, let's go!
It's okay, Sean.
Take it up.
Take it up!
The space shuttle has landed!
What're you doing later?
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
I don't talk that way.
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!
Ahhh, ahhh...
Now what?
Gotta sneeze.
Don't you dare.
Back, Kelly.  Lean back!
Did you see that?
That?
Yes, there is goes.
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
Calvin said it was all right.
Make sure you put this back.
No, South Georgia.
What the hell's there?
Polar bears.
Polar bears in Georgia???
South Georgia, Antarctica.
The world's southern most reaches.
How far away is filter number four?
I'll go with you.
It's not closing, Mike.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
Look great, don't I?
Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
Took it this morning.
He needs a haircut.
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
Who's grown up?
Gee, it's good to see you!
Come on, let's go.
Something wrong?
She still talking to you?
We're in love.
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
We'll shoot this with an .18, boys.
I wouldn't mind going down with her.
You want to show this?
You'll spoil her.
Come on, sweetheart....
But you always let me....
Daddy, why can't I...?
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
You're welcome.  I was the one who cried.
Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee....
Can I make sandwiches...?
Yes, I did.
Where are you going?
No way....
It sure is good to be home....
Make a list.
We need beer....
I miss him, Matt.  I still can't believe he's gone.
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
How come it's my responsibility?
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....
What the hell are we arguing about?
No fair, I'm not armed.
Then don't come any closer.
Turn it off....
No....
Off....
Close the door.
Where have you been...?
What's wrong?  What happened?
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....
You knew...?
Where's my mother?
It'll grow on you.
Henny Youngman....
You caught me....
You want to try your hand at something...?
At least he doesn't have a beard....
We'll be there....
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
They won't kill it....
I hope the man knows what he's doing....
Stop that....
Stop what?
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
I see what you're doing....
Are you all right?
The fish.  Check it....
You check it....
He heard that.
Don't be late.
In a minute....
You can stay in my room.
Can I ride one sometime...?
I like Grandma's cooking....
No, no...It's too dangerous....
You're coming, aren't you...?
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
I almost forgot....
I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.
Sit down, Ma....
I want you to give up that terrible job.
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
You're damn right I'm serious....
I'm just getting started....
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
I didn't mean to start that....
All you all right?
How are you doing?
I'll be all right, Michael.
I want you to give up your work....
Mom, please don't start that again....
You could teach...You could....
You're having a good time....
I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....
I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
It's late....
Trying to write our report....
You look tired....
You and Sean used to make....
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
There's nothing to worry about....
You hungry?
Why'd you come out here?
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
Promise me you'll be all right....
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
It could have been an accident....
How can you just take the plane like this?
Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
I can't....
Sure you can....
I don't know how....
It's just like driving a car....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
How do you like flying?
What's wrong?
No, you're not....
A drink with an umbrella in it....
You're not going to bet it all....
I have two right feet.
Our little island seems to agree with you....
I could take some time off....
You're always taking time off....
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
I'm sorry...I....
There's nothing to be sorry about.
You sure you don't need glasses?
I tried to tell you...I tried....
I can't....
They had them on the big one....
I have coffee in the thermos.
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
You the architect?
Hurry!
It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....
What do you mean, it'll find her?
You sure you know how to do this.
Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
Keep it steady....
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
The damn thing is going to have our asses....
Matt?
I don't know what the hell to say....
Yeah....
Still chasing fish?
Still tagging conch?
We'll be done pretty soon....
Inch by inch....
She's a tough lady....
I wish there was something I could do....
Let me speak to Ellen....
How many...?
Will you leave me alone...?
The females have eggs....
The readings suck....
I made them, man....
I stuck them on, man....
You didn't stick them on right....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
Put me down....
They won't fight with me....
Maybe I missed you too....
Bad boy....
Forget it....
It's not a bad life, Jake....
He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
How many?
Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
What?
Where is everybody?
What happened to Clarence and...?
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
We don't write up anything until we're done....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
When we got the grant....
When I got the grant.....
When I signed on....
When I invited you...
We got it together, Jake....
I don't know shit about electronics....
You sure you've done this before?
And it's always worked?
What are we getting out of this old bucket?
What she's got.  Nine knots....
How long have you known Hoagie?
How long?
Bring her to starboard.
Who?
I don't remember.  One day he was just here....
Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction....
Half don't...Bring her about....
I am...You must know something about him....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
We lost it....
Maybe the gear crapped out....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
I'm coming...How close is it?
I didn't ask you to....
What about Carla's gig?
I'm going down, Jake....
You getting a reading on them?
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
How come only me?
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Funny, Jake...Funny.
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
'A Moray eel....'
Stop that!
You don't like my voice...?
You told me what?
What the hell are you doing?
I've got to get to her....
All the time....
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.
Your equipment has crapped out again....
I'll do it, Jake.
No way....
Here it comes....
Who grows more beautiful....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
More beautiful with each passing minute...
Oh, Jake... 
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
She's in management....
You have the safety talk at school, one o'clock tomorrow....
I'll take care of it.
Did you like that, Mama?
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
The van?
Only me and Mom ..
How about any guys on your staff?
Did you bring it with you?
I hope I'm not intruding?
What do you think?
How's the new residence?
O.K.
What does that mean?
Why so coy about the word "frozen"?
Because, don't get into it ...
There's nothing in the files?
Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
You gotta stop smoking ..
How'd you do it, old man?
Someone bet me a dollar ..
Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
This looks promising .. I think this one could be it?
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
Pay me, and I shut up.
I haven't got it.
Then give me that Zippo.
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
What do you want it for?
That isn't what you said before.
Did he shut you down?
Did I say he did?
Why's she blind, Bro?
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
Well .. I didn't know that ..
That's a very stupid question, Ross.
Ease off, John ..
What about Citrine?
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
What exactly you doing, John?
Listen, you don't havta come?
Where's your watch?
I guess by the bed.
Bits.
What if we need a back up?
Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down.
I got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut ..
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John.
Three or four.
I'm talking, outside the girl?
And did they?
I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..
Did you find the knife, Sergeant?
No .. But we have a theory ..
Kid told me he didn't take it?
What are you looking for?
Vehicle references.
John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?
The elevator wasn't working?
Can I see your hands?
Did Amber have a dog?
Yes.
What color was it?
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
What are you reading?
Hamlet. Have you read it?
No.
Are you wearing a uniform?
Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
Do you pray?
Have you known her long?
I know what you're like ..
Ross told me.
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
Just your age.
Which is what?
You're looking worried again, Helena?
Why can't I stay with you?
It's not possible right now.
I'm going back to the institute.
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
Why does he want to kill me?
I can't identify him ..
He doesn't need my help.
I know about alcohol, John.
You do?
I think they're gonna arrest me.
What are you doing, Travis?
You got a warrant for this?
Yes, Sir.
Who sought the warrant?
You find something curious in that?
When did John divorce?
Two or three years ago.
You think John would like it?
How you doing on those shoes?
Is that Margie?
No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
Except for the hair color, she looks just like Suzanne?
You want something, darling?
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
You can drive down there, Sir ..
Don't annoy me, Travis.
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
Don't ever stop fucking me!
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
Okay, this is working.
Now.
I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
This can't be happening to me.
Could you just stop moving?
Jerry.  You and I are salespeople. We sell --
Listen to me!
No.
Didn't hear it.
There is something missing here.
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
No one has ever dumped me.
Don't let him stay up too late.
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
He's asleep, right?
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?
I see what you're saying.
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
Reporters, Jerry.  They been callin' all night.
... this is... uh... too funny...
Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
No no...
Hmm.  Pretty good.
Now what did you lose?
Well, thanks.
Well, take care.
No no. I knew.
You think so?
That took guts.
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?
We are?
It's all going to work.
Well, I'm happy for you.
Thanks.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
Beer okay?
Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab.
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
We will be fine!
-- especially one like this.
Truth?
Me too.
Don't worry about it, boss.
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
Yeah, I did.
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
Well, good evening.
Happy. He said "happy?"
Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
Well -- this would be goodnight.
Oh God.
Fine, I just --
Sure you're okay to drive this?
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
If I said that, would you stay?
I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.
Why do you love me?
It's my fault.
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
I don't need you to "stick."
You want...
I don't know --
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
So this break... is a break-up.
What about medical?
You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
Wait. Where is he?
He's coming over.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
Denver is where he should be.
Said who?  Sugar?
Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
Call me tomorrow.
You love me now, don't you?
--  the kwan.
Great word.  Towel?
You're telling me to dance.
What's wrong.
If you get injured, you get nothing.
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
I'll get you some quick work --
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
No, I don't know.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
You don't want to go home, do you?
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
I'm asking you a question --
Fine.
We still having dinner in L.A.?
Jerry!  You made it --
Thanks for coming.
I have to ask.
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
How sad --
Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
You gonna get that --
Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
Marcee --
I'm sorry what I said back there.
He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
You okay?
I'm fine.  What's up?
Pardon me?
Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
... dick?
You'll lose.
One-two-three, swing.
No.
They do, my brother.
Hi.
Let's go the zoo.
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
I don't see any.
Show me the animal, Jerry!
I'm scared.  What is it?
Eric!
This is how you make dinosaurs?
Do you think it goes all the way across?
Oh, my God.
What is it?
He says it's a bad idea!
How much weight have you lost?
You hate to swim.
You look good.
Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
No, Dr. Grant says...
Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.
Oh, don't worry about that.
What?
Nothing.
What did you say!
Young adult.
That's him. Thats Eric!
Eric! Are you here?
I don't know. I don't have it with me.
When did you have it last?
I don't remember
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
We should try fishing again.
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
You had the phone the whole time?
PAUL!
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
I dont know.
I thought you were an expert.
Eric!
We'll be broke in four weeks.
Absolutely not.
They're here.
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
Is it a rex?
How would you classify it?
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
They never got that big.
Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
We could co-write a paper.
ALAN!
I CAN GET HIM!
He used to know me.
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
Anything good?
Raptors, mostly.
You think they could talk to each other?
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
A well-accepted theory.
Eric, your parents are both here.
In Costa Rica?
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
Did you read Malcolm's book?
Yeah.
We need to head for the coast.
Are you sure?
Do you have any kids?
Bonitas.
You should.
We're safe!
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
I have never been on this island!
Well that's good.
Amanda!
You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.
It matches the pictures.
Any damage?
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
It doesn't matter what I think.
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
Oh --
Do you have chromium tapes?  The others fog in high-
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
Are you looking for a problem?
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
Hi, Dad.
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
Is that kid still bothering you?
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
Well, is he?
"InGen."  What's InGen?
Where does it say that?
What are you guys gonna do?
Dad!
Cancel that, Dieter.
Okay.
Where do you think you're going?!
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
What in Christ's name is going on?!
What is?
What is that?
Where's the power and radio setup?
We took to the rock.
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
What's he got in there?
Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
Their what?
She's gutty.
No way.
Do you see any family resemblance here?
Then this is our chance.
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
What do they want?!
No.
What are they?
Come on!
We can't stay in here!
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
Head for the roof!
I have to find Kelly!
I think she's with Sarah!
Something's wrong.
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
Why did you come here?
Why should they?
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
How many rounds did you find for that weapon?
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
Funded by whom?
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
Oh, God.
Ian.  It's guano.
What?
These formations.  They're dried --
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
-- way we could safely --
Hold it down, Nick!
WHAT ARE YOU-
Where's Kelly?
Ask her.
You're sure we have to?
Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.
Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
Phones are out too.
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
How many lines of code are there?
But would we get the phones back?
How long will this take?
Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
These are dilated.  Take a look.
They are?  I'll be damned.
I have samples all over the kitchen. 
There you are.  Out you come.
Oh my God.
Fascinating animals, fascinating.
Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the grating.
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
The what?
Anything else, you old fossil?
Okay, who's the jerk?
Why would they care what we think?
The movement!
So what are you thinking?
Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
Oh, shit.
Constantly sick.
Not just every six weeks.
Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
- - barfs them up - -
It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
You can't hold it by yourself!
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
Ellie, com one!!
Dr. Grant!
Do you see anything?
Alan?!
I'm going with you.
Okay, I'm on channel two.
No. We can't.
It's all right.
I get ah - -
And scary.
It's anti-nature.
Dino droppings?
Can we chance moving him?
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.
Hola, Juanito
What are we looking for?
Up and down, up and down!
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
In a box under my seat.
Are they heavy?
John, we - - what I'm just saying....
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
I read your book.
Listen, ahh - -
Tim, are you okay?
I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
I threw up.
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
So am I going to help you with your foot?
That's a good idea.
I doubt it.
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.
You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.
Go, go, go, jump!
Are you crazy?  What if you miss?  I hate it up here.
So you two dig up dinosaurs?
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
Machines hate you?
I didn't say you were scared.
I know.
Where does he think he's going?
You're sure?!
Oh my God!
We gotta do something.
What?  What can we do?
Hey, we were saving that!
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
Can't you stop these things?!
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
It's safe?
It's safe.
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
I'll stay awake.
All night?
I like cows.
Watch how it eats!
Let's go!
C'mon Tim, move down, damn it!
Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.
John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
John, John.
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
We miss you.
Thanks for the presents.
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?
No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop!  Stop! Stop!  Don't let the monsters come over here!
They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.
That's not funny.
Fifty.
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
Mister Biller?
Yeah?
I think we're lost.
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
I really think we should go back...
Who is this? What's going on?
I don't know...
What about that other guy?
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
He... he's here...
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
It's still on.
What?
What happened?
_Krueger_...
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
Well?
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
Cute waitresses?
There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
See this?
Yeah, what is it?
That doesn't make sense.
Add it to the list.
Great.	When can you do it?
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
And if he's not?
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
How long will the effect last?
About ten minutes.
Where do you live?
My assistants, I presume.
You look like brothers.
Yes -- we do.
Have you worked here long?
Fine -- terrible.
Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?
Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
Yours is a very powerful and important firm -- it has a lot at stake.
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
Just what you've published.
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
You work in the cemetery.
A man must eat --  And drink.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
-- You appreciate my writing.
What an extraordinary request!
It's my last and final one.
Then its authority is in doubt.
I gave it to him yesterday.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
No, I left it in his office.
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
You're just doing your job.
You're detestable.
You wanted to see me, sir.
I understand you fancy yourself an author.
The <u>Orlac</u> claim.
I know.
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
Why would you suppose so?
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
Hello again.
I've never seen you here before.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
Are you free tonight?
You almost married recently, didn't you?
Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
Eduard wanted to marry me.
-- I don't know the Musil district.
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
You don't believe that.
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
I've heard of it happening.
Kafka -- is that your real name?
Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
Your office is the Workmen's --
Where you've been employed for seven years.
I don't know.
No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
Can I ask -- how you found me?
He wasn't a lonely man, though.
What makes you think so?
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
Maybe it's true then what she said.
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
-- Just doing our job.
That's <u>mad</u>.
Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
Ludwig.
They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous.
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
Oskar!
We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.
They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
Amerika for us!
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
Get the hell out of here.''!
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
He's grubbing for money, father.
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
I'm sorry ...
I want to thank you.
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
It's the same image - Kong!
Jack!
Oh Jesus ... you took it.
Barricade the gates! Quick!
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
There's no island there. We're wasting our time!
They' re dead.
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
That's your monkey, Denham.
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
It must have been terrifying?
Yeah.
Why?
Coz of something I lost.
What's that?
Compassion.
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
What about him? Yes.
Why? She's a junkie.
-- May I? It's so --
I'd just be guessing.
Don't belong?
Well I have to close up now.
Look -- could I use your phone?
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
I guess he figured it was better.
What was better? I made better bait?
Yes -- all right --
-- We can talk --
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
I said yes, I see.
What about?
My name's John Klute.
Will you let me ask you some questions?
You remind me of my uncle.
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
How would I remember?
I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
What? This?
Well do you think it was him?
What do you think?
Do you know where he got the dumper?
He never told me.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?
Is there anything more I could --
I don't see anything, do you?
What're you gonna do next?
And I don't think that was Tom.
You said it was!
Yeah, you got to me.
Oh, don't be a doo-doo.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
-- Then you don't need me.
How?
How can you do it to yourself?
I don't get you.
Ligourin: How could you do it?
Please.
Is that all you have to say?
What?
You and I -- a relationship.
I was wondering what that was.
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Right back at the start, right?
Where'd you spend last night?
With Trina.
I called Trina.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
How do you know how bad it was?
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
Mm.
You're going back?
Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
Then, close the case.
I better keep looking.
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
Someone's been doing all these things.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
Just send me a money order.
Well --
John, how are you?
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
All right.
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
I know Tom Grunemann.
We grew up together. Kids.
Well?
Think this is our guy?
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
Are you closing the case?
Mr. Kramer?
Where is the child?
He's in his room, playing.
Does that distress you?
Not particularly.
What does?
No.  But I've been to Brooklyn.
What about your mommy?
Oh, sure.  Here, this can be mommy.
What do you like best about her?
Lunch in a restaurant.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Ladies and gentlemen...
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
Greatest.
Show.
On earth.
When is mommy coming back?
What about my orange juice?
When is mommy coming back?
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
Mom, I mean dad?
Sure.  Too much birthday cake, right?
Mom, I mean dad...
C'mon, there's not much difference--
You get a new fence.
Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay?
Salisbury steak.
All it is is onions and gravy.
I'm allergic to onions.
I think I'm going to throw up.
There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
Then eat around it.
I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...
Daddy?
Daddy?
Uh huh?
Is mom ever coming back?
I don't think so.
Good night.
Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Yes?
Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite...
Objection.  You're leading the witness.
Objection.
It's my name too.
Wow!
Is this really your desk?
Yep.
Did mommy ever see this?
No, she never did.
Are you going to get remarried?
No, son.  Daddy and mommy will never get remarried.
Mom--I mean, dad?
What did you do when you were little?
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Was there apple juice when you were little?
I don't understand, daddy.
What don't you understand, pal?
Who will read me my stories?
Objection!
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
No, I did not.
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
And what is your present salary?
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
Yes.  Very much.
Objection, your honor.  The answer is, to be generous, very vague.
So do I.
Eight, almost nine years.
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
No.
A heavy drinker?
No.
Was he unfaithful?
I don't recall.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
Somewhere in between.
Is that...permanent?
Yes.
Were you?
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
What about Billy?
Where are you going?
Hello, Ted.  You look well.
How's the new job?
I've seen him.
He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
Okay, I'm here.  Now why did you--
Ted, do you love him?
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
Only can I still see him?
Hey, what's the rush?  C'mon, walk me a couple of blocks.
Yes.
Yes, what?
Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
How should I know?
And?
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
I lost him?  I lost him?
What if I fight it?
We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.
I'll take my chances.
It's going to cost.
Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer?
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
Ted?  Are you there?
Yeah.
Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.
How many?
No.
OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
Things? What kind of things?
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
Got it.
You're on your own, understand?
I understand.
You're sure?
She ever ask about me?
Uh, huh...Yeah...
What d'you tell her?
Thelma, if I die--
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
You heard anything yet?
Ted.
Ted, I just heard...
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
We must go, Holiness.
Please, come, Holiness.
All quiet?
Yes, Holiness.
Where are you from?
Mama, my story.
Again?
I am sorry, Lhamo.
Not the way to talk to people.
No.
I do, now.
And you have horses? You love horses.
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
Will you buy the sheep for me?
Where will you keep them?
Here. We'll collect them.
I will buy them for you.
Can I free the prisoners?
Goodbye, Kundun.
Are you, General?
How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
Dalai Lama.
General Chiang.
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
I have.
He has been imprisoned, here in the Potala, Holiness.
The Sera monks have surrendered?
Did you receive the letter?
And the United Nations? Surely?
With much bloodshed.
Yes.
Holiness?
Oh, no. Where will he go?
I miss my brother.
How many?
This many?
Who am I?
You could buy them.
What do you think?
I am him.
How big is Tibet's army?
Roughly five thousand men.
Will we be in this war?
In the Pacific Ocean.
It is an island. American territory.
Where is Alsace?
What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
Tell me.
Ask whatever you will.
Britain?
Britain chooses not to.
And, America?
Where is that?
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
I am scared.
Did you ever doubt it?
They will take Lhasa next.
Good day.
Good day.
Please, come in, so cold.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
Me?
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
Is that a true story, or pretend?
What do you think?
What does the butter spot feel like?
I have more men.
Is that true or pretend?
Pretend.
I want to go down there.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
We have enemies.
The Chinese.
This is Britain.
Ahh.
The people want you made Dalai Lama.
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
You will not come?
No, Holiness.
We have.
You, kill me?
How could I ever leave?
It is possible, Holiness.
You are unharmed?
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
No.
Too young?
Like my mother.
You killed him.
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
I'll sue you.
You're a beautiful woman.
It seems like we're getting lower.
It happens when I land.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
And you like me.
Jesus Christ!!
What the hell are you doing?!!
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
You're crawling around like a--
I'm laying a spring trap!
I coulda shot you, you--
They don't really attack underwater and--
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
Was he a good man?
Asia?  How... how could he get here?
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
What's that?
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
I can arrest you!!
Where is he?!
This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.
And again.  How would you get him on land?
The more he thrashes, the better.
You ready on shore?
I got something on the screen.
Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
You take care.
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
He was an Indo-pacific.
<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
Nothing's real.
Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
No.
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
What?
You're gonna be okay.
Guess I finally got bit.
He's gonna live?
Kelly Scott.
Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
Why are you here?  Really.
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
Same thing from Fish And Game.
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
I beg your pardon?
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
It's too dangerous for--
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
Okay.  We're up at six.
Good.
Good.  See ya soon.
You okay?  Kelly?
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
<u>Are</u> you okay?
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
I didn't say it like that.
Like little children.  You okay?
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
Sorry.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
No thanks.
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
Thanks for the... bandaid.
Ssssh!
What?
Thing we can lift it?
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
I'm not mushing it.
You're mushing it a little around the--
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
Calm down.
You calm down!
What?
Okay.
We might as well pack.
Are we crazy?
He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?
He's floating.  Take it home.
He's mooing.
Hector!!
He's through fighting.  Look at him.
Get him onto shore.
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... 
It was... something meeting you.
I'm ready when you are.
Half mile up, there's a clearing.
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
What's that?
White perch.
Are they feeding?
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
You said nobody came in here!
Now I'm gonna puke.
I can't.  I'll get Hector!!
If you get a safe shot...
I'll take it!
Thanks for your help.
He just came up screaming.
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
I wouldn't.
Well.  At wakes.
This is a little different.
You talk to the married couple?
You have a thing against museums?
I got nothing against--
You're sort of a rude person.
Was he swallowed?
What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
What?
I thought I saw...
Hey!!
You threw it at me!!
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
You like Jack?
Hector thinks you like him.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
You think Jack's handsome?
Hank?
Hank!
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Did you get him?
Should I?
Kelly.
The somebody else part?
It's ten after nine.
This is what we do?
Are you on drugs?
Part of our research--
I'm not even a field person.
No.
Liar?
Myra.
Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?
Never cock. Just squeeze.
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?
Boy, is that smart...
No. He won't come after me.
Lecter said a lot of things.
'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
"- every day."
Hot damn, Clarice.
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
You're all right! Where is he?
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
Okay, Miss Starling?
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
That wasn't me.
Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
Who's the subject?
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
Miggs has been murdered.
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
I am, yes.
That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
It's much better than your shoes.
Maybe they'll catch up.
I have no doubt of it.
All that detail, just from memory...?
No, I came because we need -
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
You're a tough one, aren't you?
Your bleeding has stopped.
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
Yes.
Big through the hips. Roomy.
They all were.
Was it a butterfly?
A moth... How did you predict that?
The death of my father.
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
How long did you live there?
Two months.
Why so briefly?
I - ran away...
No.
Did he try to?
He kills w-
I heard a strange sound...
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
Yes...! They were screaming.
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
Thank you, Clarice.
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
What...?
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
Time, Pilch! My move.
Of course it counts. How do you play?
We leave in the morning?!
Are you alright?
Can we rest soon?
You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
"We're a breed apart and we make no sense"...?
Mr Poe?
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
Because what I am interested in is right here...
No. I will find you.
Are we safe?
And my compliments to you...
Will you go back to England?
When? How?
My letter...
There was none!
What?
There was no letter.
You still have an aversion to the water?
"Some"?
Will you consider that?
My God, Alice.
One called Magua arrived.
I see...
Yes. Go ahead.
... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
We were headed...
Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
What?!
Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
No.
Fort Edward, then?
No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!
Who were these people?
Ottawa!
That is sedition! Treason!
Where do we go from here?
We don't.
Any powder?
What did you say?
I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
And what is that?
Webb's at Edward?
Sir!
Advance, Sergeant Major!
Shoulder arms!  Present! 
Sergeant Major!
Excuse me. What did you say?
Gifts?
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
Wampum?
Gold could be arranged.
For Munro children?
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
What is enough?
The honors of war?
Granted.
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
France.
Le mot d'ordre?
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
Doc eat already?
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
It's got Hazy!
Jesus Christ...
Can you fix it?
Go on!
No!
Where the hell've you been?
Your suit, Becky!
How do you know it was Williams?
You did good...
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
I need more light on that, Four.
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
No.  I'm just being friendly.
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
Shit!  He sent them all.
What are you doing?
We're on backup air.
How much time does that give us?
We made it!
It hit me!  Where are they?!
Where's Doc?!
What's wrong with it?
Excuse me, sir...
No!
I'm going inside.
What's your air reading?
Twenty minutes...
Give me a readout, DeJesus.
How do you feel, DeJesus?
And it killed Bo?
Do it.
It shouldn't be a long delay.
Made your million, yet?
Not yet.
You got money in this tub?
Personal effects...
Yes sir...
Bullshit.
Still bothering you?
Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music.
Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
Hey!...I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!
It's Sixpack!
Typhoon?!
How far away is she?
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
I'm going to try to remove it.
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
It would explain the suction- like appendages.
Clear for pickup.
Who were you talking to?
What on earth's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...
What is it?
What is it?
Don't spend all day down there.
Are you okay, Jonesy?
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
It saw us!
Answer them and quit kicking me!
Hardly.
How much did you part with?
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
A what?
Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.
Well?
You want a pint, go to the pub.
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
Like what?
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
I don't know what you mean.
They were . . .
You fucking well have to get 'em!
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
I hate these Southern shites.
Nope.
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
Have you counted the money?
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
Son, have a look in his locker.
I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
You all right back there, mate?
About twenty minutes.
Is he on his own?
Just carrying a bag.
It's not him, Dad.
All right, Dad.
That's no way to answer the phone.
Is that you, Dean?
Sure is.
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
Who was that?
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
Dog, I have found the cash!
There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
It must be this one.
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?
And all your friends, there's a good lad.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
Where?
Out the back.
And the weed?
Invitations.
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward.
That's it all done, we are off.
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
There's nothing in it!
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
What the hell are you doing here?
Everything all right out there, Tom?
You and me, Tom.
Tom, this is our case.
Tom?
You got it all?
Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.
That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.
I will.
You will what?
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
That's if I want to see you.
I'll see ya.
For half a million?
That you, boy?
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
Go on.
I like your bar.
Yes?
I want your bar.
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
I can't help you, Plank.
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
How much did you say it was, Tom?
You know how much it is, Nick.
And that does include the amp?
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
I'll only be a minute.
Look. Go on, look.
At what, exactly?
My van is half full.
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
You would take a pain n the arse full stop.
How many feet?
What are you carrying, Willy?
Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
I don't know what the big deal is.
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
I can't take any more school.
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
I-I can do the job, sir.
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
Who's "they"?
How do you think I got to be a colonel?
Do whatever they tell you--
I do, sir.
Because it's a job?
Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"?
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
Why don't you start with that?
Yes, sir.
So you knew this young man before?
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
You're dismissed.
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
And you and Private Graves--
Private Johnson!
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
Sam the Man.
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
That the word on our boy?
Yeah, this is Skinny.
Charley Wade.
You know the popular version of how he left town.
Colt Peacemaker.
A .45--
He swore by it.  What?
It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?
Whole different story; isn't it?
Do I seem jumpy?
Same weight I always was.
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
350 pounds.
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
Hey, it's the General.
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
Come on in--
If it's too late--
Where'd he get all this?
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
My mother said he never asked about--
No sir.
They fought against the Indians?
Same as they done in Mexico.
But they were Indians themselves.
They were in the Army. Like your father.
You know who I am?
I got a pretty good guess.
That guy who got shot--
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
Didn't have a father?
Dad--?
You wouldn't?
How's your room shaping up?
My father.
Yeah. He lives here, right?
You lived in the States for a while?
Fifteen years in El Paso.
Made some money, came back here--
This place is a gold mine.
What?
It's a lead mine.
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
You going to get married?
It's a .45.
They were using M-1's, yeah--
Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
We been through this before--
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
That ring--
Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
That where he was shot?
That's where he fell.
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
Why would you want to do that?
Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]
Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
Reputation?
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]
Como se llama? [What's your name?]
Is very beautiful, your car.
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
Senora Cruz?
What are you doing out there? Are you crazy?
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
I have some friends who have had a accident--
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
This girl is a friend of yours?
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
This girl has a child?
We have a daughter.
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
Tell that one, Hollis--
"Mas cerveza por favor."
Historic occasion, isn't it?
Seems like we have another one every week.
That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.
We don't need a new jail.
Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--
I heard there was a bit of a fuss.
I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
I haven't been out here for a while.
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
You thought any more about our murder?
We have a murder?
I got an idea what happened.
Fellas.
Hey, Sam.
Buddy Deeds--
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
Steve called for you.
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
How 'bout the Sheriff?
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
If you spent a little more time training them--
He was killed.
Right. When he was killed.
A little older than Paloma is now.
I was too busy.
Thank you.
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
I never said that. It was just that boy--
Mrs. Bledsoe?
That's me.
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
You ever play one of these?
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
He had the club out on the old trail road--
Not if I can help it.
Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
Okay? He's not here?
No. Is he sick?
I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.
That was the night he disappeared?
Could of been. That was white people's business.
And when my father was Sheriff?
What about it?
I'm not open. We were just talking.
Of course you can.
Yeah?
What's she singing about?
She finally got in--
It's Saturday.
You got in late last night.
Can I get this?
Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
Morning, Sheriff.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
Time marches on.
How much you got left?
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
I thought he busted you a couple times.
That's how I ruined my stomach.
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
Something wrong?
They've got my Amado.
Got him here?
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
We haven't talked since high school.
He's all yours.
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
Your mother still doesn't like me.
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
I thought you got through that pretty well.
People liked him.
Yeah.
Your boy, there--
Amado.
Nice-looking kid.
He hates me.
I should get back.
Wow.
How come it feels the same?
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
How long have you lived here?
Pilar--
Yeah?
What was your father's name?
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
We start from scratch--
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
You're out early.
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
They got telephones.
Gotta be in person.
Yeah.
How 'bout you?
Don't know if I'll still want it.
I didn't want to be going around your back.
You think we need a new jail?
Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed.
You telling me what to do, Roderick?
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
I haven't seen anybody come by.
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
Hell of a spot to put a business.
No--
I know you?
Name's Otis.
Payne.
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
I know that.
How come you don't took familiar?
You going to tell her?
You going to tell him?
He doesn't need to know all my business.
He's gonna find out.
Mister D'Amour?
How much?
Hello, L.A.
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
Who?
Nix.
Nix?
Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
You heard right.
My life was too weird for her.
That's Butterfield...
Take a look at this.
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
Hokey enough for you?
How'd you spell that again?
D'Amour.
Right.
Right.
You did.  Didn't you?
Why would I do that?
Who did this?
D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?
About?
Death.
What about death?
Please.
I could scoop them out.
So tell me where Nix is buried.
I'll tell you.
Anything?
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
Yes...
He's with us...
Yes.
And are you afraid?
Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.
He's a secretive man.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
Harry.
Harry.
He's good.
I don't know where you'd start.
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
They won't tell you anything.
They were jealous of him.
Why?  Because he had you?
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
So why did you marry him?
Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
It was more than that, I think.
He taught all this to Swann?
I wasn't.
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
Nothing?
I was so afraid.
Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
Are you sure?
I'm sure.  He's dead.
And they all came...
Yes.
What was that?
Are you all right?
Oh God!
I've got to help him.
No!  No!  No!
... oh... God...
I'm here, Harry.
...yes?
Don't look.
Harry?
Is it finished?
What the fuck?
Harry-?
Valentin?
Good.  There.  Yes?
Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.
It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.
... they believe you.
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
Sure.
Somebody killed him.
Oh God.
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
Where the fuck is he?
And this Butterfield guy--
--vanished.
They weren't worth a damn.
I heard he was the best.
Oh, I've got plenty.
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
With what?
Shit.
Mr. D'Amour?
Go away.
It's one in the afternoon.
We've never met.
Then what do you want?
I'm here to offer you a job.
I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
Whose is the car?
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
Maybe I just bought it.
Philip Swann?
You know of him?
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
Any movie stars buried here?
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
I don't think the dead much care.
Are you sure?
Who is she?
What the fuck are you doing here?
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
What for?
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
Yes.  It's regrettable
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
I like to know why things happen.
I want to speak to Dorothea.
I'm afraid she's not in.
I can't let you in.
Yeah, I know.
Leave her alone --
Are you satisfied now?
I tried to pay you off.
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
I want to see Swann face to face.
D'Amour --
Shit...
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
What's her problem?
My God.
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
The Puritan?
Yes...
Where'd you learn that?
What?
At birth.  I don't know you --
You know Vinovich?
For what?
For an introduction.
Are they all in the business?
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
How the fuck do you do that?
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
Or murdered, like Nix.
I did it for Dorothea.
So Nix won't come looking for her?
Oh Jeez.
You think I'm an asshole.
No.
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
Yes.
They got here before us.
... no...
He's better off this way.
Nobody's better off this wav!
That's where we're all going.
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
This is where we killed him.
Yes?
Can you do it?
I got to go.  I'm late.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
A couple of weeks.
One question.
What?
Have we met before?
Maybe... I... don't...
What about Philip Swann?
He's not!  He's not!
Nix! Nix!
Is he the Puritan?
Yes! Yes!
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
Swann?  What are you doing?
You could still help me do that.
Why would I want to?
No!
These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
Hello?
Bob, it's me.
You'll do it?
How long have you been married?
Two years.
Oh.
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
What did you study?
Oh, what do you do with that?
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
No, how about you?
Not really. How long are you here for?
Ok.
I don't want to go home.
It's Charlotte.
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
Really?
Did I scowl at you?
No, you smiled.
Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
You're possessive.
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
No, yes, it does...
But, I'm mean.
That's ok.
And marriage, does that get easier?
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
I know.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
It's for my daughter.
How old is she?
Four.
Nice one.
It's bad isn't it?
We should get you to the doctor.
Where's your husband?
Working.
I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
What do you want to drink?
So, where'd you go today.
I'm sorry.
When are you leaving?
Tomorrow.
I'm going to miss you.
That's what you said the other night.
Charlotte?
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
You're leaving right now?
Well... have a good flight.
Thanks.
Why are you crying?
Mr. Harris?
Yes?
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Oh?
Mr. Harris?
Yes?
Do you like massage?
I don't think so.
My stockings.
Yes?
Lydia?
Ok, well... I love you.
Hello?
Bob?
Is this a bad time?
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
It's just carpet.
That's not what I'm talking about.
I don't know.
What?
You know, eat healthier.
Alright?
Not all that pasta.
Fine.
Hello?
Hello, Bob, it's me.
Hello?
It's Lydia, your wife.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
Fine. Is it going ok?
It's ok.
Do you want to- 
That's ok.
When are you coming home?
Great.
Excuse me?
Hospital?
Hello? Yes?
Hello, can I have room 5601.
Evelyn Waugh?
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
How'd it go today?
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
You wanna come?
Sure.
I don't know what to do.
You smell weird.
Like popcorn?
Hair stuff?
See you later.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
Oh, the record company sent these...
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
Are you sure you want to stay?
I miss you.
John! What are you doing here?
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
It's amazing  there!
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
You never said anything to me...
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Uh...sure...I...what?
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
What?  That's horrible!
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
I'm still shaking.
I can't believe Will killed him.
I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.
Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
I'm just temporarily off my game.
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
What're these?
I don't know.  What are they?
I found them in your file box.
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
What a...jerk!
Nonsense, it's all of our home.  So how's work treating you?
...you wearing a watch, Father?
What time did you make it for?
And how would you describe him?
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
Is he going to be okay?
What is it?
Something he said, just before...
He spoke to you?
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
So...we won?
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
What's his name?
Peter...Peter Kelson.
Two negatives always make a positive.
Peter Kelson?
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
And also that...
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
So...what did you think of the tape.
So what'd I miss?
We need to talk.
What are you looking for exactly?
We needed to know all we could.
Get up!!
You okay?
When's your birthday?
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
There's nothing else here.
What's the bible for?
I'm scared I'm slipping back.
We're going to do this.
You have to say that.
Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?
No oxygen to the brain.
Plenty of time.
He was trying to tell me something.
How much time do we have?
Good seeing you again.
Hello?
I know who he is.
Maya?  What do you mean?
And what are you thinking we should do now?
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
You don't want to face it.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
You know what?  You can go.
Get out of here.
Mr. Kelson, here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
He can see you Thursday.
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
Lemme guess.  The lottery.
Yeah.
Good of you to stop by.
Would you sign it for me?
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
What's the matter with you?
He could see me.
What's up?
How're you doin' today?
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession.
Parents died?
Yeah, murder-suicide.
Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
Monica, what did you do?
Nothing.
Taste this.
I can't eat before a game.
You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
What?
Monica.  What are you doing here?
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Dad around?
Need any help?
How is he?
Engaged.
To that stewardess?
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
Don't curse.
I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
Which one for tomorrow?
The blue.
Okay.
He's fine.
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
I can take it.
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
Can I take your coat?
Sort of.
Careful.
Huh?
My mouth is kinda dry.
That was nice.
Wait...
Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA.
Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.
You could make a career by telling me where.
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
It means a lot that you came by.
Damn, girl.
What?
I don't wanna see that.
So how long is this trip?
Nah.
Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
To do what you love.
Always on my ass, anyway.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
No one's forcing her.
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
I found you someone.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
I know...
No.
This brother from my college.
He's in college?
And he's fine, girl.
How'd you get him to say yes?
Oh, great.
You do.
You ever been in love?
Too many times.
They ever love you back?
Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
You lost your head.
I know.  But chances are...
Hey, munchkin.
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
You shoot like a girl.
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
I was just playing ball.
You were trying to make me look bad.
What's up?
Well, what do you know.
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
Can you take that damn thing off the table.
So what are these Spanish guys like?
One, up.
For real?
So how come you could play basketball?
Your Dad play?
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
I don't like flowers.
I think we gotta kiss now.
For how long?
I don't have to do what you say.
Way to hoop.
I know this.  What do you want?
A ride home.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
Didn't know you cared so much.
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
That's it, give it your best shot.
With a jacked-up attitude.
Didn't know you cared so much.
See you made it.
Yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
He ain't Spalding.
Mulholland Drive.
Four.
What?
What was that about?
Yeah.
You do see me standing here, right?
It's okay, little baby.
So how about a little one-on-one?
What are we playing for?
Clothes.
Give me the ball.
Kiss my booty.
I won.
I...can't.
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
Hey.
Sorry about your game.
Who was that?
Nobody.
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
You want to go talk?
You know what, I'm just gonna crash.
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
Hey.
Hey, what's up.
The "man" again.
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.
What the hell's going on?
We're going to get some food.
Can we talk?
Talk to your new girlfriend.
Cheap date.
Least she had time for me.
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
Least you got your priorities straight.
I never asked you to choose.
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
Look, I'm entering the draft.
When did you decide all this?
Few days ago.
So that's it, just forget about us?
Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.
Just something I'm trying.
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
Yup.
Not for Quincy McCall.
So, how's pro-ball, Europe?
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
Tried calling you a couple times.
Actually, I don't...
Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
Who's this guy I always see her around?
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
So...how's the knee?
It just isn't.
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
Like what?
Maybe go back to school.
So why'd you give up ball?
Why do you keep asking me that?
Cause I don't get it.
Something was just missing.
What?
Better late than never, right?
I'll play you.
What?
One game.  One-on-one.
You're out of your mind.
So you're gonna bitch up?
And what happens when you lose?
Hey, girl.
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
There's so many I just can't keep track.
Give it yourself.
With who?
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
Not great.
What's that, not great?
Nona, please.
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
What?
We still have to go?
Okay.
You hearing me?
How was your game?
Still the man.
Where's your dad?
You scared me.
Sorry.  You okay?
Just...leave it alone.
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
What people?
Tell me what?
I just told you.
What are you doing here?
Your door was unlocked.
Still is, so let yourself out.
And some things should never fucking happen!
What do you want?
Came by to check on you.
No.
Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
What surery?
You smell like trouble --
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
You ok?
C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --
Hey, Janet, it's Chad.
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
Well can you connect me to someone else?
Uh-huh.
Does this sound weird?
What kind of Cancer?
Brain and Lung.
My mother had breast cancer.
Oh that's good.
It was scary though.
It's a helluva disease.
...what the fuck is this...?
What the fuck do you want?
Don't yell, honey.  Please don't go crazy --
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
Honey.
...Hello...?
OPEN THE DOOR.
Did you hear what I said?
No.
You don't have a boyfriend?
No.

You just move in here?
About two years ago.
Bit messy.
You and your boyfriend have a party last night?
got some coffee brewing, huh?
-- do you wanna cup?
I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
Yeah.
Is this boyfriend bothering you?
I don't have a boyfriend.
The gentleman who came to the door --
Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
Just Jim.
yeah, good, ok.
Bye, bye, Claudia.
I'm sorry, Claudia.
Well...is that illegal?
Really?
Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
It's my favorite place --
Great, bye.
So you've done it --
Wow....huh..."...piss and shit..."
What?
I'm sorry --
It's fine.

Yeah.
Can I tell you something?
I lost my gun.
It's ok.
I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.
Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
Say what you want and you'll see --
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
What?
Just say no.

Ready to go,go,go?
It's upstairs.
Have you ever been there?
C'mon guys, settle down --
Cynthia?
How much time do we have?
Not enough, what do you want?
I should maybe go to the bathroom.
Can you hold it?
I don't know.
What happend, what's going on?
Let's go, c'mon, get up --
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
DADDY! DAD! DAD WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON?
C'mon, Dad.  We gotta just GET HIS MONEY AND GO, LET'S GO. Let's get the money --
We're not gonna do that now.  We're not gonna do that now and that's over.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY MAN.

GIVE US YOUR MONEY.
Put the gun down, please, boy.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
How much you pay me for my help?
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
Why the hell aren't you in school?
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
Ok. Listen. You: c'mere.
Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
Have you ever been to Juvenille Hall?
Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it.
I'm almost done.
Did you listen to me?
Doc it's Janet.
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet.
Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
You look like you've got money in your pocket.
This sounds threatening.
Is it real love?
A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
....do you know who I am?
You're a friend of the family I presume?
What?  What does that mean?
What?
"The" cause of dullness in others --
This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
I confuse melancholy and depression sometimes....
Mmm.Hmm.
I'm sick.
Stay that way.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
You mind your own bussines.
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
...please...
What is that?
Braces.
Braces?
Yes.
You don't need braces.
Yes I do.

Give me your keys, Don.
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!
He has Phil right now.

Do you wanna sit down?
How's today then?
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.

She loves you.
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
When was the last time you talked to your son?
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?

Other fuckin' assholes like me.
There's no asshole like you.
Do me a personal favor --
Go fuck myself?
...gimme that fuckin' phone...

Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
No.
...Lily...?
What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
Hello?
Hi.  Is Frank there?
I think you have the wrong number.
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
No.
Alright.  Thank you.
That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
I'm confused about your past is the thing.
Is that still lingering?
-- just to clarify --
Are you asking me that?
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
It's all important --
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
Mm. Hm.
C'mon, Frank.  What are you doing?
Yeah.
Where are you from originally?
Around here.
Hollywood, mainly.
Well I guess it doesn't.
She's retired.
Are you close?
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
And your father?
He passed away.
I'm sorry.
people die.
I wouldn'tve asked --
Not a problem.
Psychology major?
Right.
Do you have your masters?
...this close...
Where does that name come from?
What name?  My name?
It's not your given name, right?
And "Frank?"
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
How long have you taken care of him?
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
Uh. huh.
I'm really sorry.
He's in here --?
Uh. huh.
It's interesting.
I don't think, he can't...
What? What? What now?
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
You can't just come in here.
The door was open, I got a call --
You're just come in --
Calm down.
There's no disturbance.
No.  I said that.
Are you lyin' to me?
No I Said.
Ok. What's your name?
I preffer to stand.

I can't fuckin' do this.
I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry.
How you doing?
I'm drinking.
As fast as I can.
-- did she talk to you?
She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
I love you.
Love you too..
I don't think I want that.
It'll take the pain away.
I'm a bad person.
Will that help?
How many times....it's ok...just say... Just say...
I'll answer anything.
Yes.
Who?
Rose, I don't --

I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?
I think that you know.

Did you ever touch her?
Jimmy, did you touch her?
...Jimmy...
I really don't know.
<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
You deserve to die alone for what you've done.
I don't know what I've done.
Hello?
Hello.  Is Claudia here?
She's asleep.
Are you her boyfriend?
You're Jimmy Gator, right?
Yes.  What's your name?
I'm Bob.
Can I come in?
Want me to wake her up?
I'm sorry.
Was it a call back?
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
They look pretty smart, I think.
You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest.
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
Shut the fuck up.
I'm trying to help, Linda --
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
Linda --
Let me call you a car, Linda.
Linda --
Hang up the phone.
No, Linda, you don't understan --

Partridge?
Yeah.
Mmm.Hmmm.
Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
Water.

Do you have that?
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
Yes. What? Yes.
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
I don't have regular classes anymore.
Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley?
I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time.
Cmon,cmon,cmon, that one to?
Be ready at two --
C'mon, man.
You're late, not me.
You coulda been in front --
You ready to keep winning?
Go to it, handsome.
I'm fine. nothing.
Why didn't you answer those questions?
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
Stand up.
...oh Jesus, what the fuck...?
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
..sorry...
....Why does he do it...?
It's not right.
I have money to give you.
What is that?
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
It's raining frogs from the sky.
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
I understand you saved my son's life today.
God smiled upon us.
No, M'lady.
What -- ?
M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
My Queen...
There were two.  Not one.  But two.
May I speak with you?  Alone?
What is it, mother?
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
What had you to do with this, Mother?
He is your brother!
How goes that favor I asked of you?
D'Artagnan, arrest them all!
It can.  I know the way.
What are they doing?
The Prison of Belle Sur.
What is that?
Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
Who is he, Aramis?
You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.
Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is ludicrous!
Those can be adopted --
How is he?
Three days.
Go on.
Now.  You were saying?
But -- what is he doing?
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
So what has changed?
Then to the Bastille.
A simple theological discussion.
I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
Pull them back, d'Artagnan.
You can't do it.
Pull them back!
Forgiveness.
I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
Aramis... is this the way to hell?
Mother of God!
It is also a place of burial.
Coming?
What use am I?
We go someplace dangerous.
Aramis... These are... these are whores!
So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.
D'Artagnan!
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
Raoul is everything to me.
I know.
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
Get out of my way.
Where are you going?
He lies.  He is here to trap us.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?
I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.
How did you know -- ?
Whose rooms are those?
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
Phillippe...?
Are you hungry?
There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
At least help Raoul.
I will consider it.  Now leave me.
I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?
Your Majesty...?
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
I was told this impostor was dead!
... You knew you had a double?
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
Where is Michelle?
... The ball... Continue.
Phillippe!
You dead yet?
Food, moron.
What number, on the first page?
... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
Now.  Where is d'Artagnan?
Magnificent valor...
Raoul... is in love...
The food doesn't please you?
You would do that, your Majesty?
Captain Doyle?
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
You mind if I ride with you?
It's Marvosa -
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
Yeah?
Where are you?
We're by Ozone...
You set to go -
What do you think?
Bullshit...
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
Did you hit him?
What did the six-toes have to say?
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
Let's roll -
I'll take the south end -
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
Gotta come from somewhere...
Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?
Alright, where is she?
So...  to get the car back, you break into her house.
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
Are you alright?
I was just having a little fun -
And where the hell is Marvosa?
He said he was following up some lead.
Captain?
So where are you from?
Up north.
Where up north?
Seattle.
No...
No.
What's going on here?
Why did you set me up?
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
I had it all on tape...
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
No...I'm in some trouble...
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
Jesus, man...
Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
And?...
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
I've got a better idea...
1490...Breckinridge...
Both at the same bank...
Ahh, shit.  We're pretty much tapped out.  I'm getting denied access all over the place...
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
I'm not going anywhere!
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
I'm stranded out here.
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
Are you a regular there?
What would your - boyfriend - think?
You don't seem afraid of much.
No.  It wasn't like that!
Where am I going?
Don't you guys ever knock?
That was Peterson upstairs.
It was you who did the asking.
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
Could he handle a direct contact?
In thirty-five minutes.
How long do I have?
That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
Where?
Read it.
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.
Somebody hurt him?
No.
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
You look all right now.
If you can't look anymore, I understand...
As long as they're dead...
Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
Get him to Atlanta.
You said the guy down here is good.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
See? You do know something about him.
Is it weird?
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
Who did he ask for?
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
Get me a plane...
Wait, Will...
Get me a plane!
I'll pick you up in...
That's narrow?
When are you coming back?
He's a very shy boy...
What?
That's why the boltcutter.
It's getting late and...
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
Have him peel the top label back.
Will...?
How far away's the back-up?
I'll cover the back.
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
Wait for the back-up! Will?
Where the hell's Graham!
He went to the men's room.
Not yet.
...twenty-eight minutes.  Cryptography at Langley?
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
What's being photographed?
The activities of nocturnal animals.
When do you need it?
Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
Tonic will be fine.
Is that you. D?
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
I have work to do at the plant.
Reba...
Francis? Where are you?
Are you okay...?
I'll see you later. All right?
You'll come by?
Who is it?
It's me.
Who?
Me.
Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?!
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
Was I in an accident?
What am I doing here?
Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
Do you feel privileged?
I'm very scared.
Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.
Do you see?
Do you see?
Oh, God.
Do you see?
Please, no.
'No' what?
Not me.
Are you a man?
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
You'll let me go now?
You will tell the truth?
Come in.
Dr. Chilton.
Do you have it?
I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
I want to see Lecktor now.
Linda King's desk.
Hi, Linda. ..
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
No. I can help you.
Do you know something about that?
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
I don't think I'll tell you.
He's right-handed.
Most people are.
He's misunderstood.
He's very strong physically.
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
To yourself...
I call him a monster.
I understand he cut you pretty good...
What did he want?
He asked how you are.
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
Molly?
Hello, hotshot!
Hey, baby! Where are you?
At the store. You doin' some good?
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
Me, too. And very erotic...
Tell me about yourself.
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
To do what?
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
Blue, then.
I remember.
Do you remember what you said?
Can I have one of your cigarettes?
You haven't smoked in two years.
No.
Can you quit?
No.
What will you do?
I have to go back to Birmingham.
Mama was probably asleep.
I want to see you, too.
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
Let's forget who said what to whom...
You going back down to Florida after?
What's that?
Meet point's up ahead!
Go on to the house.
Lt. Fisk said...
What do you want?
Are you George Sherman?
Yes. Who are you?
My name's Will Graham. I...
Will it keep them out?
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
Yes.
We don't know that.
Did the girl die?
No.
She got all right?
...after a while.
And Hobbs died?
Did you get my card?
You've read the transcript. It's all there.
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
Yes, I thought so.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
I thought you would have some ideas.
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
Then how did you catch me, Will?
You had disadvantages.
What disadvantage?
You're insane.
Pictures?
No.
Do you dream much, Will?
What were the yards like?
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
I want your opinion.
I don't have one right now.
May I keep the file?
Kevlar Second Chance.
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
Tank you veddy much.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!!
No.
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
You have to do it.
Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.
Andy?
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
Andy!
Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
I can't move my arm.
My hair is coming out.
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
Andy!
Five.
Twenty!
Ten.
Right...
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
Hi...
Hi... am I late?
Popcorn?
Hi...
Hi... am I late?
Popcorn?
Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.
Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?
And all this will be for real?
Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
Go away.
It's me.
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
You don't know the real me.
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
How can you be so casual??!
You're NOT DYING!
I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!
You're not listening to me --
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
GET OFF!
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Then your father's a wimp.
I'm gonna quit.
Each show is worse than the next.
Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
Give me the book.
No!  Andy, don't do it --
I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
It's so dirty.
Sir, do you have a problem?
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
Are you at peace with your family?
Excuse me, Andy...
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
Are you sure?
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!
Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?
Er, yes.  Speaking.
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
That was a really hot house!
So your name's not Gorsky.
I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work.
Why...?  Andy, why...?
If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.
I saw Michael!
Where?
Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy much to do.
What's in Memphis?
Why is he saying these things?!
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!
Sure...
What's your name?
Bob Gorsky.
"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
It's my name.
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
He'll be contacting us again.
Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
We'll need a search running.
You don't know.
The sewers.  Of course.
Hurry!
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
Lieutenant?
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
He's gonna make it.
Weird.
That's the third white van I've seen.
What?!
You're two hours late.
You got the money?
If you get caught using that --
You weren't supposed to relieve me.
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
Are you sure this line is clean?
There's something about him, isn't there?
Hello, Trinity.
Cypher?  Where's Tank?
He had an accident.
... yes.
I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!
Sorry.
No, it's all right.
What are you doing?
Is that...?
Why you're here?
How many were there?
Five.  Since I've been here.
What happened to them?
Dead.  All dead.
Thanks... for the drink.
Operator.
I got you.
Are they any agent?
Yes.
All right --
I got a fibrillation!
Give me your phone.
They'll be able to track it.
What is he doing?
How long?
You can't use that until Neo is out!
Who's coming for me?
Stand up and see for yourself.
Right now?
Holy fucking shit!
But what if...?
Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.
It's an honor.
No.
This can't be...
... am I dead?
What are you doing?
Why do my eyes hurt?
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
For what?
How did I beat you?
Do you know why you didn't make it?
I thought it wasn't real.
Do you understand, Neo?
Yeah.
Set down in there.
So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
The beginning?
Of the Resistance.
And she knows what?  Everything?
She would say she knows enough.
She helped you?
Yes.
What did she tell you?
And you still believe I'm the One?
How is he?
Got it.
Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
We need an exit.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
Tank, charge the E.M.P.
I'm going to make the call.
That vase.
What's funny?
Hello, Neo.
Who are you?
That was a long time ago.
Gee-zus.
I just thought... you were a guy.
Of what?
They're watching you, Neo.
It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
From what?
What is this thing?
Uh-oh...
Get this thing out of me!
God...
But an Oracle can.
That's different.
Is it?
Are you worried?
Did you go to her?
Yes.
Are you all right?
What did you just say?
Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
Go!
We can't leave him!
Is Morpheus alive?
What are you doing?
You can't!
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
Why?
What are you doing?
I'm coming with you.
Neo, how did you do that?
Can you fly that thing.
Morning.  Did you sleep?
See who?
What are they doing to him?
They're hacking his mind.
Why?
Which way?  Which way?
It's locked.
We need an exit!
You're not far from Cypher.
Tank, you're hurt.
There is.  We have to pull the plug.
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
Neo!
What the hell just happened?
What just happened?
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Know where he is?
Look fella...this is private...
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
No.
That means it's good.
Sssh!  Quiet.  Y'know that's illegal.
Well the guy over there said...
Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
Yeah.
Why?
I gotta get the stuff.
Hey hold it!  Gimmie the cash.
Uh...can we give you a check?
No.
May God be with you.
'And with your spirit.'
Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?
Who's the girl?
Jewish...
Look at her.
Where to?
I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?
Nervous?
Yeah.
And say what?
Panther...
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
Waddaya think?
Next time, bet with your own kind.
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
You got some mouth!
Drinks for everybody Tony...
I know but let's hear it anyway.
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
There won't be any this week.
What do you mean?
Hey...you got nothing here.
Don't come any closer!!!
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
That's not going to help.
Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this...
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
Don't you move!!!
Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
No...I'll be ok for a week.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Michael, give us a lift.
Hey, shut up.
Disgraceful.
Out!!!!
C'mon Johnny.
You getting out too?
How much?
$3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?
Where's the rest?
Diane, how are you feeling?
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
Uncle, how are you feeling?
Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
Take a drink!
Hey, where you been?
Oh...around...why?
Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
Well, maybe you missed something?
Wasn't a book...was a short story.
Nothing.
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
"Francis Macomber."
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Please take it.
Well...
Sure...it's not that...I mean...
An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
Maybe, who knows.
Charlie...?
Anything specific?
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
What is it now?
Did you?
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
Take your time.  I don't care.
That W.A.S.P. bastard.
You're intolerable today.
You know why...with my parents.
Well you can't blame them in a way.
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.
The girls like it loud.
What's the matter with this kid?
Don't count it...it's all there.
Count it.
Scumbag--
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
Sal!... fourteen street.
Come on.
This is some boat.  Your father's?
Hey... you got stereo.
Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.
Yeah, it's your father's.
Well...no.
You mean it's heisted.
You could say that.
How about me?  I don't get a drink John?
Just keep him quiet.
Friends of yours Michael.
How much?
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Can you spare it?
Sure.
-- But he does seem very nice.
Look who's talking.
Did you speak to the Governor?
He's coming.
Daddy!  Come on, a name.
Just plain 'Joe'?
That was 'Joe'.
He's cute.
Daddy!
Hi, Allison --
Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
I know you do, darling.
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
What is this?
I don't like cake.
It's for the party, Dad --
Oh, the goddam party --
Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
I haven't been the father to you that --
That you've been to Susan?
Yeah, but --
But what?
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
Red or white?
Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
What are you eating.
Toast?  No...just the butter.
Hello, Beautiful.
-- Did I hear 'business'?
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
Well... goodnight.
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
Thank you for coming.
Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
Here...
Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?
Cold.
Yes.
Yes.
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
Of whom?
It doesn't matter.
May I interrupting?
Perhaps you could remind me.
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
In my sleep.
'Yes'.
Did you just hear something?
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
It's going to be great --
Do you think I need a haircut?
I'm all excited --
Like a marriage made in heaven?
Yeah, something he goes by --
'Joe...'
Is there any more to it?
Have we met?
...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
I am now.
No.
'Just kidding'?
Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.
Mind if I throw up?
Whose?
That's it?
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
And what do I get?
Yeah.
'It's up to Joe', huh?
Yeah, that's what he said.
He was interested.
-- But he was concerned about the timing?
'It's up to Joe'?
I'm going to put a stop to this!
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.
Obeah.
What you then?
I nuttin' to do wi' dat.
Not time yet.
None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
No, I come to see Doctor.
My Doctor Lady?
Yah.
You loved back?
I am.
She knows you real self?
She knows how she feel.
Rass!
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
No.  Nothing.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
Good morning, Jennifer.
The Board is waiting.
How long you here, Joe?
Black.
You're an original, Joe.  A little hard to figure, maybe...
Thanks.
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
Confused, huh?  About what?
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
You love Allison, don't you?
Oh yes, I do.
What are you doing here?
I'm lost.
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Do you love Drew?
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
I've got plenty of friends.
I don't have any.
Susan?
Goodnight, Joe.
Oh goodness, no.
Then why are you here, Joe?
Very well, I'll watch.
Watch me do what?
Whatever you do.
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
And I'll be a visitor.
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
Joe, I'm with Drew.
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
I appreciate you --
Excuse me?
I mean I appreciate that.
I am, too.
No, I'm not.
Girlfriend?
No.
Gay?
Where are you going?
To bed.
'To bed'?
Almost.
I love your smell.
You're here?
He's taking a nap.
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
Did you like making love to me?
I loved it.
Where are you going?
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
For how long?
I like you in a black tie.
I love you in an evening gown.
We know all that we need to know --
But there's so much to tell you --
Don't.  That will come later.
What will we do?
'Love will find out the way'.
'Love will find out the way'?
It's a saying.
I believe that, don't you?
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
Susan --
-- Yes?
You think so?
What a good idea.
I won't.
How long have I got?
Well, thank you for letting me know.
Not at all.
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Good morning.
Good morning, Bill.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
Sounds fair enough.
It is a deal?
Bill --
Joe --?
Make an exception?
I'm not everybody.
I want to live.
What's it like?
What do you mean?
What's it like where I'm going?
Can you keep a secret?
Yes.
Now I'd like to be alone.
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
Are you going to eat your lunch
And more.
Why didn't you stop me?
I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
Dinner?  Absolutely.
Why did you go to the hospital?
I don't know.
I wouldn't put it that way.
What way would you put it?
Okay.  Goodnight.
I'm sorry, Bill --
That's okay.
What's okay?
I'm not hungry.
I couldn't sleep.
I'll be the judge of that.
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
Yeah.
What the hell do you care?
You're what?
Those were my words, Bill.
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
I don't like what you're saying.
I don't expect you to.
Okay.
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
I told you to shut up.
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
I'll take it from here --  I am --
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
Happy Birthday, Bill.
Not exactly.
Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?
You are --?
Death!
You want me to be your guide --?
You fill the bill, Bill.
I do?  How long will you be staying?
You should hope quite a while.
Excuse me?  Could I say something?
Of course.
'Yes' is the answer to your question.
I didn't ask any question.
I think you know --
What are you talking about?
Are you giving me orders?
Where are you?  Are you there?
It's enough now.
What do you mean?!
I think you know --
Where are you?
Get what?
Watch it!
The 'question' --
Hi, Bill --
Good morning, Quince.
How're you doing--?
I'm doing great.  You ready?
I am, this is it.  B Day.
Next week?
But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?
Yeah, I give a shit.
You think Drew will go for it?
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
Good morning, Dad.
How did you know?
Drew told me.
Does Drew tell you everything?
I hope so.
You like him, don't you?
I don't like to interfere.
Not my birthday again?
I thought you were in a meeting--?
...There's a start for a meeting.
Do you love Drew?
Don't get carried away.
Well, I wasn't going to say that --
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
Daddy, what's the matter?
What is it, Daddy --?
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
We've met.
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
It'll come back, Daddy.
That was wonderful.
Yeah, it's good to get together.
Then what is it?
Where's Joe?
Where is he?
Where's he going?
What a night.
Are you relieved?
I love you, Daddy --
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
What was that?
Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
What's the way?
Nothing lasts.
I agree --
I could be her.
How 'bout another cup of coffee?
I've got to go --
Did I say something wrong?
You said you liked me.
No --
...We know so little about each other.
That's it?
Hiya.
I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
What can I do for you, Leonard?
I'm sorry... um... ?
Condition?
I have no memory.
My wife.
Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 *
How long have I been here?
Couple days.
So you're holding my calls?
What makes you think he's my friend?
Shit. Wrong room.
This isn't my room?
No, let's go.
This was your room. You're up in 304 now.
Why didn't you clean it out?					 *
Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
I know you said you didn't want any calls...
What?
I haven't made a strong enough impression.
I like your car.
Thanks.
Where'd you get it?
What the fuck are you doing here?
Do you remember me?
Yeah, I remember you.
Don't say anything else.
I don't want blood on them.
You think you can bargain with me?!
So you have information for me?
Tell me about her again.
Deals?
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
They treating you alright?
Sleep okay?
Did you?
His name was Jimmy.
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
What do the police think?
Where is he?
What are you gonna do?
I'll go see him.
He'll kill you, Lenny.
Yeah?
Yeah, I hated it.
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
What's wrong?
Calls himself Dodd.
Did you?
No!
Neither do I.
Don't protect him.
I'm not.
Help me.
What?
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
Don't say another fucking word!
They're not looking for him.
On the house.
My wife.
Sweet.
Dying.
What?
Beer, please.
What do you want?
What are you here for?
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
Well, that's me.
You're the memory guy?
How do you know about me?
My boyfriend told me about you.
Who's your boyfriend?
Are you Teddy?
My name's Leonard.							 *
Did Teddy send you?
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -
I'm not appealing the decision.
How can you read that again?
It's good.
You've read it a hundred times.
Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!
I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm -
Did you? I musta forgot. I'm Teddy.			    *
This is your car.
Yup?
Mr Gammell?
Lenny, is that you?
Unfinished business. What made you think I wasn't coming back?
So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
You don't know him?
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
Natalie? Natalie who?
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
I'll ride with him. You follow.
Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
So what are you gonna do now?
Who the fuck are you?
Teddy. Your buddy.
She couldn't.
She has no idea who I am.
My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.
You're not coming?
This is a drug deal?!
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
My wife wasn't diabetic.
It makes all the difference.					 *
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
No, you won't.
Somehow, I'll know!
When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
No. You took them out.						  *
It is now.
Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles.
Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.
No.  I was in Namibia...
Yeah.
What's your twenty?
Turn around.
We know these people...!
I was the kids' godfather.
And...?
...eliminated one.  SWAT's on the next two...
What do you think?
We're not certain...
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
Sure.
I don't know.
Yes you do...
Okay.  You got the "item"?
How many?
Two main players plus three.
My end?
25% discount on the load.
Make it 40%.
Make it 35.
You do.
We want it back.
What's "nothing"?
What do you like to drink?
How fast does that go?
It goes very fast.
So where's the best place for mojitas?
The Keys?
Mojitas...?
Later!  Do you dance?
Tell <u>me</u> everything.
No.
Died in childbirth, having me...
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
That's right.
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Cost less.  That's the point.
Is it December?
What do you mean?
Good samba dancing...?
Zero risk.
Twenty-eight-point-five.
Hola, chica.
I forgot the napkins.
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
Do I need it?
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
When?
Would you find me...?
Of course.
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
...in the morning.
Yero, by himself?
No part of it wasn't real.
What's our deal?
And there's Dmitri...
The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
Alonzo...
Stevens?
Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So...
Then it don't work.
Anything?
Where we meeting 'em...?
What do we got?
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
No.
How much we looking for?
Where the hell are you, man?
Where?
Verdado.
Verdado where?
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
You're not makin' a move on her...?
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
Hey, fuck him.
What is going on...?!
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
I am asking.  You to me.
Eleven to seven he blows it.
Twenty on my man...
Go ahead.
Hello?
This is Agent James Fujima.
Detective Crockett.
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
Meet and greet.  "I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours?"
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
How?
So what do you want?
Yeah...?
Sonny...?
Yeah.
Where's Riccardo?
On the phone.
It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...
Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
They had me from the gate.
Alonzo...!
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
You okay?
Yeah.
You sure?
Okay...see you soon.
...and thanks for the flowers.
You mean with the flowers...?
What's it say?
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
That sonofabitch!
What do you care?
Then what were we talking to you for?
This the load you lost a while back?
I gotta, I gotta go...!
Alonzo...
You're hoping to get a look at what?
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Beg pardon, ma'am?
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
You're such a doll. I hate money, don't you? God, it's been fun.
What you gonna do back there, East?
Lotta rich women back there...
Yeah?
Men, they mostly faggots.
Must be some mess back there.
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
He's got taxi fare.
I ain't sleepy.
Okay. Never argue with a man.
You gonna beat me, Joe?
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't mind if I do.
For what?
For money.
For money for what?
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
You want some free medical advice, shut your goddam mouth about that night.
You don't seem like no fag...
You want me to stay here tonight, is that the idea?
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ.
Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso.
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
You got a comb?
Don't need a comb.
Tell her, Ratso.
And what?
I'm scared.
I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.
These guys're good drivers.
You get your first palm tree in South Carolina.
I read it.
I'm wet.
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
I simply don't have it, Joe.
Get outta my way.
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
Uh, yessir.
Ready for hard work, son?
Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida chicks...
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
You got it.
Sold. Let's go.
... and taxi fare for me.
Getchmis olsun
Yeah.
History, man, history. How much?
Two kilos.
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
You got that, shit face? Asina...
It's there!
Want me to take over?
What?
How's your hernia?
Anybody bitten?
Who?
Shit.
Haps, railroad, bus timetables?
Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
Where'd you get that limp?
Where you staying, Dad?
The Hilton.
You know where they are?
Sure.
How far?
About ten kilometers.
Sixty Lira?
I'll pay extra
Would you recognize him again?
But just...
...are you with the Consulate?
How much you pay this joker... this cab driver?
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
Got a family back there?
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
What's your father do?
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
How's it feel?
New people sometimes get on his nerves.
What they give you?
How much did you have?
A hundred grams.
He wasn't even in the car?
Hello, Billy.
What do you mean?
But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?
You got your stuff?
Yeah!
What time is it?
We go back.
What?
After we're outside the kogus?
Oh we... we...
What?
Cut his fucking throat.
Max, sit down. You're in no shape to kill anybody.
I want to cut his throat.
You know where it is?
Hishradyo.
Never was anybody like you...
You can't take anything seriously.
Billy, what's the matter?
My passport!
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
Cat, ah!  Ayip!
Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay!
Work, work, work, that's all do
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
His name?
Who?
What lawyer?
Hey, you can't...
What's your name?
The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."
You really love flashing that thing, don't you?
Immigration's gonna love you for that.
Peter...
Yeah...?
There's some weird shit here.
I think so. One right, two lefts...
And a right.
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
We'll be back at the platform in...
Did you see the size of that thing?!
Oh, that's gonna work.
You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
I only got...
Its muscles are locked.
A mistake.
"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
The kid...
The kid's with them!!
My God, what the hell are you...?
What are you putting that crap on me for?
He didn't do it!
Which way?
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
Please.
Do you think we did the right thing?
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
Metaxonycha Godmani.
Honey, just leave it.
I heard how you talked to him.
He was just doing his job.
Great crowd.
Oh, no, you were-
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
It's me. Can you hear me?
No, Jesus, no.
It's no use! They know we're in here!
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
Rub it on the windows!
What-
Peter-
It worked before...
Oh, come on, come on!
You go first. I'll be right below you.
Your arm, you can't...
C'mon...
Ah...
Talk to me.
No...
Hello.
You sure you didn't see one of these?
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
What?
It bit you.
This wing configuration. I've never...
My God.
That's impossible.  Insects don't...
What do you want to know?
Sure.
If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime.
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
Here.
What are they...?
You want to read it?
What's your new book called?
I don't have a title yet.
But what?
Nothing.
Pretty rough so far.
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
The profanity bothers you?
My daughter must be going nuts.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
Thank you so much.
For a while I thought I might go crazy.
I'm...
Done?
Yeah, thanks.
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
I DIDN'T...
Show me the way?
Then light the match, Paul.
No big deal.
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
I want my pills NOW!
Here, in case you think of any ideas.
"HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!"
What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.
I can't write this anymore.
What about a bee...?
What?
Have to wait.
To celebrate Misery's return. I couldn't have done it without you.
I hope you like it.
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
Well, it certainly says you.
Annie, what is it?
Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
You've been out of your room.
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
I'm glad you like it.
Paul, this will be our legacy.
What things?
Yes, Paul.
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy.
Stop--stop right here.
What?
They're hauling Misery into court.
Just leave it, all right?
What is it?
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
It's good you found it.
Yes.
He's your client, huh?
I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
Hey, Pete.
Buster.
Answer me a couple things?
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
Newspapers?
No, the typing kind.
Did they win?
Yeah. They're in the semis.
I thought you were over it.
I thought you were going to dinner.
Well that depends.
How I usually find you, Nyah.
How do you that.
Magic...
Your room.
Mmmm.
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
You won.
To win?
You picked another winner!
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
Feel like pleading for your life?
God damn it, Nyah!  Why did you do it?  Why did you save that bastard?
What are you talking about?
An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i>
Fight a bit of a cold..
And you're happy about that?
What was the top bid?
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..
More like two-two point two million.
It is, Billy.
Exactly where is she?
Range is two kay.
There she is.  I got visual.
That's it?  That's it? That's it?
I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan.
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
How much longer before you can reach him?
Do you know me?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
What if I pay the rent?
Uh-huh.
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
Would you mind if I'm on top?
- right..where is it?
Where's the bloody -
- torque wrench.
I wouldn't do that.
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
What's you name?
Awfully short notice..
Care to wait a decent interval?
When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing.
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
They've got a book for this?
Which is?
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
Damn, you're beautiful.
Five, six-hundred thousand.
There's nearly 2 million in London.
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
I'd like a little more conviction..
So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
And that's the only reason?
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
How's it going?  Everything okay?
Just like old times.
Just like old times?
I want <i>you out of there.</i>
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Like what?
An idea, yeah.
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
Yes, he knew.  Just..
..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
..I'm fine..and you?
That simple, huh?
Nekhorvich's boss?
Left jacket pocket?
Roger that.
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
She must still be on the property.
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.
Luther, I'm looking at security.
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
So what did he say?
A visit from an old friend.
You have Bellerophon.
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
Come on!
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
To friends.
That's S.O.P..
But why tell us?
Hes putting on a show, Barnes.
Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
Satisfied?
All ten million.
Is he serious?
Krieger can get it.  Right?
Did we get it?
We got it.  On your feet.
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
I'm walking.
Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.
No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
What happened to Jim?
There was nobody on the bridge.
They're dead.  Jim's dead.
Take off your coat.
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
Did they send you...Did they send you?
The message is for Job.
Max made a deal with you?
May I come in?
You don't think we're going to make it.
I didn't say that.
You didn't have to.........
I just need you to be safe.
We did what we had to do.
Kittridge...
Is this the only way?
Two cars.  Where are you?
Claire...Hey...
This stuff is so sticky.
This is Kittridge.
Go ahead.
Theyre dead.
I dont think so.
No sir.
Yeah.  I follow you.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.
Yes.  I see your point.
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
What are we downloading?
Information.
What kind?
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you.
And I get to keep the equipment when we're done.
Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
Now I want you to hold onto it.
Reach your folks?  How they feeling?
Here's to  you, Luther.   To being off the disavowed list.
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
Why don't you come back with me?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
Who are you and what are you doing here?
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
That depends.
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
Like Job?
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
Why, may I ask?
That's the question I want to ask Job.
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
It doesnt, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
Bank?
IMF mainframe.
Where exactly is it?
Zero body count.
We'll see.
Merci.
You're not going to any meeting without me.
That's not it.  That's not the list.
Claire.
Sorry, am I interrupting?
Give me the God damn gum.
Jack.  Jack.
He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
Higher.  Higher.
Higher.
OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.
The package is in the open.
Ethan.  Hes out of pocket.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Im coming to you.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
I thought I was going to see Max.
You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
I'm willing to take the chance.
Forty-four.  Forty-five.
I guess.
Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
You're going to use Walter?
He's our guy.
Ive got a shadow.
Can you lose him?
Abort.  Thats an order.
Where are you?
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
Yeah.
We dont have to, Jim.  Hell come after us.
Whats going to make him do that?
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
Youre probably right.
You got it.
And get a doctor.
Loud and clear.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Why don't you take a look?
Jack...that's spying.
That's what we do isn't it?
Too wicked to have a drink later?
Such a nice ass.
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
Yes...  Its him.
Whats the problem.
Try it again.
I always check the batteries.
Its working.
Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
No, I'm going.
Are you ready?
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
Uh-huh
I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny.
Who's dead?
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
I have no money!
I don't wanna talk about it.
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
Rita. Pass the wine.
Cosmo?
Thank you, Rose.
You're welcome.
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.
Okay.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
Hi.  Hi.
Bed.
Here.  Ti amo. 
Ti amo.
You look tired.
What's your news?
I'm getting married.
Again?
The guy died.
What killed him?
In a month.
He did?
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
What'd you do to your hair?
I got it done.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Who is this man? You're engaged!
You're my father.
Alright. I didn't see you here.
You haven't once said you like my dress.
Why you looking around so much?
I don't know. I got a feeling.
It's wrong to just let them go.
I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.
Why didn't he call himself?
He's in Palermo.
What's wrong can never be made right. 
Yes.
I'm going to marry him.
You are going to marry my brother?
Yes. Do you want...
I have no life.
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
That's it.
Loretta. What's that smell?
You don't have to help me.
I know that. I do what I want.
I like it well done.
This is good. Uhh...
Loretta.
Where'd Johnny find you?
He knew my husband who died.
How'd he die?
Bus hit him.
Fast.
Instantaneous.
When you get engaged?
Why?
Why what?
No.
Seven years ago.
How many men since then?
Just Johnny.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
She was right to leave me.
You think so?
What are you doing!
I'm telling you your life!
Stop it!
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
A bride without a head!
Son of a bitch!
Where are you taking me?
I can't believe what is happening.
Me neither.
I've got you.
Get all of me. Take everything.
What?
It's so bright.
Oh my God.
What? What have we done?
You're trying to make me feel guilty.
I'm marrying your brother!
She didn't like me.
You don't get along with anybody!
What did you do?
What did I do?
I can't do that!
Why not?
Snap out of it!
I'll come to the wedding.
I'm telling you you can't.
But he wants me to come!
But that's cause he don't know!
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
Hi.
Hi.
You look beautiful. Your hair...
Who painted that?
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
Thank you!
So. Where are we sitting?
They get some turnout for this stuff.
Awful?
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
No thanks.
What do you want to do now?
It's really cold.
What's the matter?
How can you ask me that?
You're making me feel guilty again.
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
He didn't come!
You're late!
This is your place.
That's right.
This is where we're going!
Yeah.
I'm really afraid.
I'm afraid of who I am.
I was.
Let me go home.
No.
Let me go home.
No.
Ronny!
You've gotta get outta here.
Loretta, what are you talking about?
Loretta?
What!
I got things to do.
What's the matter? You look crazy.
Bye, Aunt Rita.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Hi Loretta.
You don't want the fish.
Maybe you're right.
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
You never have dessert.
Have Something.
I shouldn't.
Will you marry me?
What?
Will you marry me?
Yes, on the floor.
What time is it?
How near is she to death?
A week. Two weeks. No more.
Alright. A month. In a month.
A month from today?
I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.
Who is he?
He's my younger brother.
Have you told her we're getting married?
I have no secrets from my family.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!
What?
Will you live here?
No.
Why not?
So we'll sell the house.
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
Hi.
Where you been?
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
Cosmo's cheating on me.
What the hell happened to you?
Your hair's different.
Everything's different.
Are you drunk?
No. Are you drunk?
No. But I have a hangover.
What? He's in Sicily!
No more he's not.
He's with his dying mother!
Do you love him, Loretta?
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
What about the moon?
Did you see it?
No.
I... a... slept with my fianc's brother.
I know.
You should think about this.
He should pay.
Don't make yourself sick.
Moving in?
I came right from the airport.
So.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
My mother's recovered.
That's incredible.
But why would a man need more than one woman?
That's it! That's the reason!
You don't know where Loretta is?
Loretta...
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
I'm sure she did.
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
Sure!
Thanks, comrade.
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
I'm not disturbed. By you.
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
Sorry. That was rude.
Will you join me for dinner?
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
Don't shit where you eat.
I'll remember that. What do you do?
I'm a housewife.
Then why are you eating alone?
Go ahead.
Why do men chase women?
You knew that man?
Temperature's dropping.
No.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
I'm too old for you.
I'm freezing
That's my house.
You mean the whole house?
Yes.
My God, it's a mansion!
He's a plumber.
Rita. Rita.
What? What?
Look.
Oh.
Is who down there?
What would he be doing down there?
You were a tiger last night.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
You got me.
She's got it.
How do you know she is a witch?
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ...
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
What?  Ridden on a horse?
Yes!
You're using coconuts!
Where did you get the coconuts?
Through ... We found them.
What do you mean?
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
Not at all.  They could be carried.
Am I right?
Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
King of the WHO?
The Britons.
Who are the Britons?
No one live there.
Well, who is your lord?
We don't have a lord.
I am your king!
Well, I didn't vote for you.
You don't vote for kings.
The same!
NI!
Oh!
NI!   NI!
All right!  What do you want?
We want ... a shrubbery!
A what?
All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...
One that looks nice.
Of course.
Yes ...
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
You said it again!
What, "is"?
None shall pass.
What?
I move for no man.
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
'Tis but a scratch.
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
Well, what's that then?
I've had worse.
You're a liar.
Come on then.
Course I have.
Look!
What!  Just a flesh wound. 
Stop that.
Had enough ... ?
I'll do you for that.
You'll what ... ?
Hello.
Well ... can we come up and have a look?
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
What is your name?
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
Ni!
Ni!
What with?
There!  Look!
We shall attack at once.
Who are they?
By what name are you known?
There are some who call me Tim?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
Greetings King Arthur.
You know my name?
What?
A G...g...g...
Look, you're a busy man ...

Too late.
What?
Where?
Behind the rabbit?
It is the rabbit.
... You silly sod.
Je...sus Christ!
Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.
Old woman!
I'm thirty-seven.
:I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.
Well you could say: "Dennis"
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
I've said I'm sorry about the old woman, but from the behind you looked ...
... But all the decision of that officer ...
Be quiet!
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Good idea, O Lord!
... Well, we did do the nose.
... Um ... Yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart.
Nothing... There's your ninepence.
He will be soon. He's very ill.
I feel fine.
What is your name?
My name is Sir Launcelot.
What is your quest?
What is your favorite colour?
Blue.
What is your name?
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
What is your quest?
To seek the Grail!
What is the capital of Assyria?
Bring out your dead!
Here's one!
'Ere.  He says he's not dead.
Don't be such a baby.
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
When's your next round?
Thanks very much.
Well taken, Concorde!
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
I think I could pull through, sir.
Really, I feel fine, sir.
Did you kill all those guards?
Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
But, Mother ...
Rather what?
I don't want land.
Who are you?
I'm ... your son ...
You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
How?
Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.
Leaving the room.
Leaving the room ... yes.
Er ... if ... we ... er ...
Yes?
Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
No ... just keep him in here.
Until you, or anyone else ...
No, not anyone else - just me.
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
What?
Make sure he doesn't leave.
Where are you going?
Well, look er, I ...
What is your name, handsome knight?
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
Camelot ...
Sir Galahad!
Oh ... hello ...
Quick!
Why?
Well, she's got a point.
We'll cover your escape!
I don't think I was.
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
No.  It's unhealthy.
... I Bet you're gay.
Sir Gawain.
No look, really, this isn't nescess ...
We must examine you.
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!
Back to your bed!  At once!
You got my note!
Well ... yes ...
You've come to rescue me?
I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.
He's come to rescue me, father.
They're all saying the word ...
|      You turd! +      Mangy scots git!
Look.  I'm warning you.
Brave, Sir Rob ...
He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
Brave Sir Robin ran away.
Bravely ran away, away.
So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
I speak as I find, Archie.
So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?
How much?
Seventy a year.
Not bad, not bad.
How about yourself?
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
It's only grief makes her like she is.
She loved him.
What?
You know what I mean.
Which one of us is she flirting with?
So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
Aye, but will they?
What are you doing?!
I'm getting dressed.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
She'll be worried about me.
She'll get over it.
Aye.
What's this?
It's a diary.
Be careful who sees it.
The place is a mess.
I can't move to tidy.
It's what the maids are for.
What's your name?
Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
Checked and locked, sir.
Louder, girl!
Checked and locked, sir.
Hey, Barney.
Yeah.
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
No doubt you've heard the rumors.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
It's the Queen's decision.
I wish to see my mother.
She's busy.
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
Do you know who you address, sir?
Whom you address.
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
It's so infernally cold in here.
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.
By whose authority?
Checked and locked, sir.
How will I know?
How will I know what she requires?
You'll be sent a message.
Who'll bring it to me?
I need a man who knows where I am.
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
Do you?
No.
Go inside at once.
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
That can wait till the weekend.
There are important papers from --
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
What do you know about the Highlands?
I am a blank sheet.
Do you hunt?
Dare say you can be taught.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
I'm fine.
You're injured.
I'm not married.
I wouldn't know.
What I do, I do for my Queen.
Was there never ambition?
Maybe, once.
Then I envy yo.
I do what I do.
For Her Majesty.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
I said.  I serve the Queen.
You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
They aren't as watchful as you.
Too busy looking after themselves.
The greasy pole.
No loyalty.
I promised to protect her from people like you.
She'll never understand it.
In time, she will.
Mr Brown.
Ma'am.
You are here safely.
Aye, ma'am.
You are well?
I am.
And the pony?
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
Mr Brown.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
Aye, ma'am.
What are those?
What?
Those, over there, there.
Are they worth reading?
I am told so.
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
What does he know about the Highlands?
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
We took a nip of whiskey.
To keep out the cold.
Must they always follow us?
I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
John?
Yes, ma'am.
Has someone seen to those bruises?
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
Then why send me back to them?!
You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
What can we do?
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
Should we take it seriously?
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
The question is, do we need her?
I see the Prince of Wales is here.
What did he want?
We're going to lose.
Who?
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
A fine choice, sir.
Erysipelas.
Where did you find it by the way?
I'm sorry, ma'am?
Why am I being lectured in this way?!
Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
Just them?
What is he doing there?
I understand he was in a fight.
How long has he been this sick?
A few days, ma'am.
Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard.  I have no wish to go riding.
Please make sure it does not happen again.
Read it.
Again?
Who told them that?
I have no idea.
There is one other matter.
What is it?
I have a letter, ma'am.
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
Where is my son?
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
He is sick, ma'am.
If I tell you, then it's no fun.
Could you play ARCADE with that?
We're having some problems with ARCADE...
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
Maybe he's not dead.
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
It's the game, ARCADE.
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
He thinks I'm "sublimating".
What's her problem?
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
Hello?
I have to talk to you.
It's twelve-thirty!
Can you turn off the game?
I'm in the middle of it...
Where to now?
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
Change the channel!
Then leave her.
Where do we go?
That's what I thought.
It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...
...but then it hits the relay stations...
It's already out.
You mean we learn the rules...
Virgin sacrifices?
Jesus Christ!
You got the schematics?
Dante's Inferno.
Alex...
You're not coming, Alex.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
You feel it?  It's different this time.
Okay.  Give us a kiss?
One.  In case...
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.
Which way do you think Level Two is?
Shit...
Our time's up.
What?!  There's nothing here!
What the fuck is that?!
We can't reach that!
So that's what we almost died for?
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
Christ...no time...
I know.
And then keep on driving?
So how did you do it, Alex?
Yes...
Then we'll go home?
Which way?
It's the wrong way!
It's here!!!
What did he do to you?
Is that your question?
I'm thinking!
Mom?  You're alive...
So how do I start?
So what do you think?
It means she's screwed up.
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
So start at the beginning...
Adam, where are you?
What's going on, Cynthia?
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
What did you say?
They fired everyone.
Someone's shut off my money!
I know.  Where are you Adam?
And?
You're broke!
But I'm not broke.
Cynthia...what's going on?
You gotta be kidding?
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
So what's the problem?
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
Howdy!
Beautiful night.
I agree with what you said...truly.
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
I understand.
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
I guess I've come to quite a place.
It's unbelievable!
I told ya.
Your Aunt called me.
I was afraid of that.
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
Right. See ya.
A car ... a car accident.
My name is Rita.
Betty Elms?
Very pleased to meet you.
Yes, there was.
Can you tell me what happened?
No. I can't.
Was anyone hurt?
Yes?
Diane?
Number 17.
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
I think I've been hurt.
No.
But, this could be serious.
No...I need to sleep.
What's wrong?
I don't know who I am.
I don't know.
Mulholland Drive.
There's nothing?
No. Just the coffee.
Strange to be calling yourself.
What's wrong with that?
"Before I kill you."
What is it? What do you see?!
Do you know them?!
Rita... I know what you're doing.
To my audition.
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
This Denny's.
It's kind of embarrassing but,
Oh boy.
So, you came to see if he's out there?
You feel it?
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
The one of 'em still alive?
Find out who they are?
So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
Making ends meet, huh.
Not here...no thanks.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
No.  I haven't seen any.
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
And now ladies and gentlemen it's time for the fabulous CROCODILE SHOW !
So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
You must come in first place to move on !
Good morning. What do you have today ?
What's going on ?
Where are we ?
What about Matt ?
Leave him, he's dead.
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
Now where do we go ?
How do we get out of this room ?
Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
Come on, it works.
So what do we do ?
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
What's the trick here ?
We drown.
So why this ?
Why did you build this whole place ?
Is this really the time ?
I wanted to let his family know....
You okay ?
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
Where are we going ?
What was that ?
What are you DOING here ?
I work here, remember ?
That's a shame.
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
NO. Don't. You'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat.
Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
Is it over ?
That's nice.  I think I lost my wallet.
What's next Walt ?
Be very, very quiet...
The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.
Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
That's not to tough.
Hey, try swimming. It works.
You okay ?
Knock yourself out.
I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.
Don't.
What ?
Don't eat at the console.
Not yet.
Stop the hydraulics.
When I think you're ready.
When will that be ?
He already had a balance of $600,000.
Parking tickets ? That's it ?
Why don't you just stop fucking around and just die !
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
Fire the whole division.
Zach, how old are you, son ?
I am thirty two.
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
One moment dear... 
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
No. I am not a homosexual.
How long till the drug wears off ?
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
Bruce has just awaken.
What is Bruce doing ?
He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
Was that the Old Man ?
There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !
What the ... ?
The power went out in half the park.
Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
Thank you.
Yes.
Really ? On a date ?
As appealing as that sounds...
Hello.
What an incredible view !
Not now, Mom.
I think we should follow him...
I'm talking to you asshole !
You don't have to sound so emphatic.
What ?
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
He was right behind me !
Hey good lookin' ! What'cha got cookin' ?
Why don't you shut up now.
Good morning.
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
You had to remind me?
Umm, where do you want this?
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
Excuse me I asked you a question.
How did you know my name?
Your Uncle Phil told me.
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
THANK YOU.
Don't mention it.
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
What about giving the other guy a break.
I'm leaving Sunday.
Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a little more.
Okay, no problem.
Visualize a spare?
Well you know what I mean.
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
No it's okay, I understand, really.
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Seriously?
Seriously.
What boy likes you?
The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer
There's still a big spot on the floor.
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
I already bought a ticket.
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
Thanks, I needed that.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.
Hi Dad.
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
Yeah.
Totally groovy huh?
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
I love you too sweetie, bye.
What happened to Shelly?
She just had a baby that's all.
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Well you should at least try a little bit.
Never heard of him. 
How about a nice glass of milk?
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who wasn't having hormone surges.
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.
Maybe he's wet?
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
Oh.  Ohhh?
What're you saying?
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
Sure am, who are you?
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
Umm...can you come in for a minute?
I'm glad you're here.
You are?
Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
More than anything in the world.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
Hi.
Come on in!
That's okay.
It's just a corpse.
My mother can't have any more kids.
What are you staring at?
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
See you? He can smell you from there.
What's the matter?
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
Is it okay if I drink this?
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
Hello.
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
Then I have come to the right place.
I guess you have.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
This is really very nice of you.
O.K. Thank you very much.
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
My mother.
Your mother?
Thanks
Give it back Nicholas!
But we made a business deal.
Nicholas! What are you doing up?
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
There's water in your bathroom.
I want juice!
Don't wake up Vada.
You're grounded 'till you're fifty!
Thanks....
He said it was a gift.
You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
Getting off please.
Vada.
I'd never do that.
What if you don't wanna be found?
You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
You ratted on my mother??
I think it's cool.
Just call us the &quot;dead end kids&quot;.
Boy, you're really into this.
If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.
And I thought I was weird.
You are weird. Let's just go.
This isn't just a mood ring.
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
Give it to me!
Come and get it.
Just give it to me!!
Just come and get it...right here!
Woah, watch it!
DON'T!!!
...I dropped it.
Where are you going???
It's dangerous!!
You mean,  this ring?
Never heard of her.
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
What do you think?
Right.
And you'd be my cousin?
Yeah I guess...sort of.
Some sacrifices are worth it.
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
An adventure?
Write me a poem?

I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
What's that?
Ten bucks.
What's it for?
For the mini-bike fund.
Well Rose was being very thorough.
I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
I don't think the color of the interior is....
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou...
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
A secret, I like that.
You want me to come with?
Then you'll be all set.
No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.
What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
He was caressing.
There's plenty of fruit.
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
I think this place is just fine.
She'll be all right baby.
Bye Aunt Rose.
So what's wrong?
Nothing, nothing at all.
Excuse me?
I was commenting on your hair.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
Good morning.
Well maybe for you.
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
You couldn't?
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
They're enormous, I know.
Is there milk in them already?
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
What's this? December 8th, 1958?
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
Why not now?
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
It would be fantastic.
But Dad'll never go for it.
Shelly?
Hey! Oh look.
Did it hurt a lot?
Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
He's a great poet.
He is?
Arthur!!
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.
You're such a baby.
Danny?
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
Keep your voice down!
The boss is watching us...
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
Can't you see it?
No.
Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
What Hurts Vada?
It's still available I hope?
They're dead?
Yes they are.
Pardon?
I need the job.
She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
What do you mean??
Well the other night at dinner...
Oh that, she just likes to play.
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
Does it make it easier to win?
Kinda like men.
I had a good time tonight.
Home sweet home.
Yeah.
Are you mad at me?
Here?
This is where we are.
I haven't danced in.....
What are you wearing?
Want to what?
Yes.
I ahh, better go.
It's only eight o'clock.
Goodnight Shelly.
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
How's it going chef?
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Well, you were pretty great!
Pointing upwards Look...
Did you ahh, love him?
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
Of course not.
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
Dad?
I love this guy! 
What?
The money?
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
You never cared before.
Why?
She likes to play bingo.
Are they ready yet?
When?
We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.
I fall asleep at the wheel.
Hi Vada.
Hi.
What are you doing.
Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.
No sweetheart, you can't.
He was allergic to bees.
He's okay isn't he?
He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
Did I kill my mother?
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
Oh yes, oh that's great.
I'm very nervous.
Are you sure about all this?
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
Hi.
Sure.
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
This is one big house for one single person.
How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
How much does it cost?
Thirty five dollars.
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
I paid the money.
For this class?
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.
I wrote a poem too.
Mr. Bixler,  I love you.
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
Cause she's dying.
Do you think she is?
He likes her.
Does he love her?
Probably.
Is that your camper?
Yes it is.
She's shy.
Who's winning?
He's allergic to everything.
He won't give it to me.
Vada? VADA?? What happened??
My ball, I lost my ball.
Can we look around in your camper?
I would.
Did you read ALL these books?
Uh huh.
What are they about?
Are you married?
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
Are you going out somewhere?
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
A girl's always gotta look her best.
Have you ever tried any?
No.
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
I won, I won!!!
NO!
Daddy??!?!?!
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
Where's Daddy?
Well he just left, what's wrong?
I'm hemorrhaging.
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
How old are you?
I think it should be outlawed.
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
I will I promise.
Thomas J?
I'm allergic to it.
Uh huh.
Eeeeuuuww, gross.
I knew he wouldn't come.
Hey look at this, no feet!
No, I'm going home.
She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer.
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
Oh no!  UUH.
Hurry!
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Naah, I don't wanna.
You could pick that scab on your arm.
It's a mosquito bite.
Uh huh.
Your lip bleeding?
No.
Where's your bike?
No, I don't wanna.
Hmmmm, interesting.
What?
You have no personality.
Hey, where does it say that?
Is that your Dad?
Yes.
Who's that with your Dad?
Do you remember her?
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
What?
Here.
Don't DO that!!
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
Pacifist!
I am not.
Bed wetter!
They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
Can we go yet?
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
You're right, let's knock it down.
What do you want it for anyway?
Run faster they're after us!!
I am running faster!!
Jump in the water!!
But I have my clothes on!
Hi Vada.
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
Come on, let's go.
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
Why are you running away?
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
I don't like her.
I do, she's real funny.
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
Leave then, some friend you are.
No, I'm hiding out.
Hi Vada, can you come out?
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
Not true.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Like they do on TV?
Uh huh.
But, I don't know how.
Like this?
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
Just do it.
Okay, okay.
Say something it's too quiet.
Umm, Ummmmm
You better not either.
Well, let's spit on it.
Seeya tomorrow.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
What?
Would you think of me?
Yeah, it's in the contract.
I should look different.
Stay, huh?
You don't miss much.
Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
You think...
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
He can't do that to me!
We'll never be the same.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
I was devastated.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
And you believe that.
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
Someday she'll thank you.
Zit cream?
Neosporin?
Try less appropriate.
Ben Gay.
I give.
I suppose it's too late to start over.
Two words.
Major.  Dish.
You're going to say it, aren't you?
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
Needing.
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
But I can't be dry.
Can you watch the road?
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.
I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
What else did he tell you...
Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
He sucks soup through his front teeth.
A trademark move, don't touch it.
But he sure can kiss.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
And the answer was so simple.
I was gonna predict that.
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
I just think you're wrong, is all.
But he always says...
So... one almost has to...
Exactly.
He'll see right through it.
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
In one minute.  You are going to feel so foolish.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
I saw the show.
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
I think he's been fired.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...
And she's all wrong for me!
Well, maybe we should talk ab...
Please come, please.
What's the sec...
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
Such as.
She's too genuine.
Endearingly absent-minded.
Every day.  She makes the bed.
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
Waiter! Check, please!
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...
Where was that, Florence, huh?
Should I whistle down a cab?
Still.  All's fair in love and w...
You're not eating.
I never eat when I'm serene.
You never eat when you're despondent.
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
Big weddings are so strange.
Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.
You miss her, huh?
Don't you throw up on boat?
You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.
And I was thinking this could be our last time.  Alone.  Together. You know?
Where did we first hear th...
So we heard it... like, right that... that first...
Takes me back.
Will she like it?
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
This thing means that much to y...
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
What happened?
Should we take a walk?  Or maybe some food sent up, or something...
Or we'll go somewhere.  If you have the time.
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
This is her family and her fault.
And your point?
I asked you...
Thank God you were here.
... your one chance for true happiness?
What's up?
Uh.  I saw that moving...
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
Lower.
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
Why would she come here...
I never forgot that.
It's two weeks.
Almost three.
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...
And to m...
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's marrying the wrong girl.
Well, that just happened that time.
What do you have to buy?
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
What?
Grand Old Opera --
I hate that music.
Winifred.
I won first prize.
You're from out of town?
Is there food?
Barnett, please -
I don't want to listen to her sing -
Don't feel that way, honey.
Barnett?
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
Don't worry, I'll take care or it
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
You going today?
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
You bet.
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
She's fine.
Well, I just thought I'd call.
Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
Whose word?
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
How is she?
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
Have you talked to Triplette?
Who the hell is he?
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
Who the hell is he?
He's going to run for president.
He has that sign with the tree.
What does he want?
That's what he wants.
You know better than that.
Well, how about the shopping center?
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
Hi. I'm John Triplette.
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
Whose?
What's he running for?
National television?
ABC.
How much?
Where'd he ever see us?
Okay.
Bastard
President?
You're kidding.
Where are you going?
National?
Come on. He's a crook.
Sorry to bother you, Bud.
Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
You bet.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
How in the world did he get shot?
Do you know Barbara Jean?
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Haven's not going to talk to me.
HI. Look at those flowers. Did you grow those.
Hi, Sherry.
Mr. Green?
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
Didn't you get?... How are you?
Yes, sir.
Can I help you?
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
Did you see who that was?
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
He is just wonderful.
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
What did you say?
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
What's this?
Replacement party.
You must really like him.
I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
No.
She had on high heels?
No.
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
You in music?
No.
We don't mess with accessories.
Parts.
Do you carry door handles?
What kind?
Nash.
What year?
Nashville.
Oh... Well.
Well, I got to Nashville. That's pretty far.
Next you'll be sick.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
Bet the sheets are grey.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
Listen. Maybe I should go...
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
Okay. I'll be talking to you.
Bye.
Yes, it is --
Well, can you tell me why?
It just is.
How long have you been with them?
Do you ever do any writing?
No, I don't.
Do you like him?
Hello.
Linnea?
Yes. Who's this?
I'm here.
Tom. You remember?
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
Hello.
Who is thin?
Who is this?  It's Tom.
Wow!
I've got a gig tonight.
End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
I have to go.
I have to go. He sighs.
Stay.
I can't.
When did you think it would happen?
I'm not sure.
How old are you?
Thirty?
Well...
I'm twenty-eight
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Premeditated murder.
You know who that is?
Yea.
They said go see the chaplain.
Hello.
Linnea?
You sound different. Is that really you?
What time?
Eight-thirty in the chapel.
I can do benefits
Hello. John Triplette.
Oh, no.
For him?
What for?
What National TV...?
An album.
Sorry I'm late.
You're not.
Where's Bill?
Sleeping.
Where are you going?
Oh?
I mean...
We just got a gold record.
How long have you been together?
Probably a little too long.
Do you study at all?
Come on.
Hi.
Hello.
I'm Opal.
Why?
Pleasure
He ain't really new.
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
Where are you from?
Southern California.
You always live there?
I know a couple.
Ah... Peter Finch.
Who?
Peter Finch -- he's English.
You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
You want a ride into town?
You sure do it loud.
Is that good?
It's not bad.
You think I should take lessons?
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
You think it will?
Oh, why thank you.
More or less.
Yes you are.
What was the color of Tim's belt?
What kind of pies do you have?
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
Are we in a big hurry?
By all means, knock yourself out.
Mickey!
Using the same doctors is not common practice.
Who isn't?
Lobotomy Bay?
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
Yeah.
How come you never talk?
She was born without a tongue.
Say something.
What?
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Tough titty, it's mine now.
You guys stay on your bellies.
How is it?
Not good.
Do you have a back up.
Ready.
Yes.
Whose ratings were higher?
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
How 'bout Manson?
She doesn't talk?
Not to anybody. She sings.
All right, Mickey.
Sorry about that.
Then was it worth it?
Says the United States of America.
I could go for a Coke.
Yeah, we have a van.
Where's it parked?
Out front.
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
We ain't got all fuckin' day!
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
Yeah baby.
And they made the first move?
Hypnotizing.
Through the power of the simple word---
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Only on a much grander scale.
Yes.
That's the Mickey and Mallory way.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
Here's the layout of the laundry room.
It's hard to say Capt'n.
Take a wild stab!
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
The entire wing?
That's my opinion.
How immediate is immediately?
Roger?
Rockin'!
Who?
Wayne Gayle.
What the hell happened to you?
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
How 'bout Mallory?
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
How's it working, Scotty?
Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.
But how can you say that?
Ya know, I was.
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
What are we talking about?
Two guys?
I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke.
Out.
Want me to come?
No thanks.
Who's going to buy me a beer?
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
It sure is.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
See Duff. He's the money man.
Boy - you hear me?!
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
'You Duff Anderson?
Want to talk to you.
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
You a union man?
Want to keep your job, boy?
I said: Cut it out!
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
Yeah.
Where was that?
Walker and Williams.
Where's Wilma?
She done moved to Detroit.
They say your dad's 'round town.
'That right? I thought he was up North.
People seen him 'round.
Where's he at?
Hey, boy - I'm talkin' to you.
Name's Duff.
How 'you doing?
Thanks.
Don't say much, do you?
Guess so.
Have anything in mind?
Where was your father born?
His profession?
Well, he worked around.
And his age?
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
Any other family?
No. Just me.  Me an' her.
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.
Hard to get up in the morning, huh?
You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.
How 'you doin' man?
Been over to the other mill?
Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.
Haven't seen you around, have I?
No. I'm new in town.
You working?
Oh yeah?
You work around town?
I'm a teacher.
Went to college, huh?
In Birmingham.
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
Your folks live there?
That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
You keep asking me why I'm here.
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
How about another beer?
No thanks.
Hell!
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
Get out of here!
Let's go, Duff.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
What d'you mean?
You almost got into trouble back there.
No, on the porch.
Oh yeah, and then what?
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
Ain't your fault.
That's the way he is.
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.
Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
Just for the day?
Goin' to see my kid.
I didn't know you had one.
Yeah. Well, I do.
Are you married?
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
That's right.
How old is your boy?
Four.
Hi.
How did it go?
What?
Your boy.
Okay, I guess.
Thank you.
How about it?
I can see why.
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
Don't call them that.
Is that so?
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Everything you cook is good.
What about them?
Am I as good as they?
Hmmm - good coffee.
You still didn't answer my question.
You know how to box?
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!
I don't want to hurt you.
Huh?
Don't look so scared.
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.
What about your boy?
How come you keep askin'?
I keep thinking about him.
Don't, Duff.
What the hell could you do?
No point fixin' it!
Don't do that!
How come you don't hate their guts?
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Ain't you goin' to say something?
There's nothing to say.
Where're you going to go?
When I get set, I'll send for you.
Okay.
Where' you goin'?
'Round town.
What's so hot 'round town?
Just get her drunk.
How 'bout the key?
A whole lot, Frankie.
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
What 'you signifyin'?
Good-bye, Frankie.
'See ya.
'You Will Anderson?
Who're you?
I'm Duff.
Wouldn't have known you.
Wouldn't have known you.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
How about a drink?
What happened?
Plannin' on getting married?
No.
I asked you somethin', boy!
Couldn't get the words out before.
Better get him to a hospital.
How you doin', boy?
No, thanks.
Seems a little loose!
She don't look no worse to me.
What did you say, boy?!
Whenever he's got an edge on.
Come back some other time, will you?
No thanks, Lee.
Well, what're you going to do?
Going back, huh?
No, they won't.
Don't be too hard on him.
Hell, I'm just like him.
Who is?!
Hello.
How are you?
Guess it's never been easy.
Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
I guess I ain't.
So I been told.
Oh yeah?
Why don't you guys buy your own?
Well, if it ain't Duff!
'Musta knocked her up.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Well, I got married to one of them.
Hell, I didn't know you was married.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
I know.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
Hi.
Come on, Will.
Let's stay here, Will.
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
He's your son.
Now you stay put!
I ain't drunk, honey.
Got a thick feelin' here.
Better now.  Where 'you at?
Let's go.
How long's it been?
We got any shots?
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
No. I only needed the code from you.
She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
What about her?
What are you doing in here?
Can you get us into Straylight?
What the hell is that?
A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
Alright. Let's talk business.
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
Why'd you do it, Armitage?
I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
You ran without us.
Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
Did you trace it?
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
You've got your orders.
An odd selection, Mr Case.
Tell me the words.
The words?
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
I saw your girl yesterday.
I don't have a girl.
Hey, bro.
Yeah. That was me.
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
We're doing fine. Take the next right.
Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
Jah guides us.
Who got you into this?
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
Never heard of him.
Yo.
Can you take me to it?
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
Where the hell have you been?
Yo.
How much time you got left?
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
You're late.
This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
What about the route to the core?
What about the mainframe's access code?
Wait... You hear that?
Want to fucking answer them?
Hello, Case.
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
Case... are you okay?
His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
Couple of months.
What about before that?
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
Maybe something's onto him.
You've been calling her name.
How long have I been out?
How soon is soon enough?
That's not going to help.
What the fuck... are you serious?
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
On a good run... yeah.
You okay?
Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
It sounds like you.
...Feels like you.
Case... it's four a.m.
I'll get the car.
Yeah... fine.
Case... Are you alright?
He projects with neural implants.
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
Is he going to make it?
We've still got to find the mainframe.
My God... these people are insane.
Shit...
I'm still going in.
How are you at riddles, Peter?
Thanks.
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
It is?
Right. 7:30.
YOU DID.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
No Roger from op/ed?
Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
You're Pam?
Guess who I did it with last night...
Roger in Op/Ed.
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
Now this is cute.
Bridgework?
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
Hi!
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
You need my help?
George! What are you doing here?
What is this?
Hidden camera.
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
Josie, you have totally transitioned.
Transitioned?
He is totally crunching on you.
Do I want to be crunched?
Don't tell me... You're Medieval Barbie.
Well, excuse me for caring about words.
Five-- Six--
You've done five of my ideas.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
A flack jacket.
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
It's an expose on cafeteria food.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Uhh, no.
Do you even know these kids?
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
Oh my god.
Rob's?
Hey there.
Maybe we should go in a different room?
Hey Rob, what's going on?
That is so--weird that you name your car.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
Better person than I.
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
What!?
Do you remember high school?
It was a long time ago -
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
No, I mean, no big whoop.
Is that true?
Better than I...
Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.
Wow, Josie- you look really-
Rufus?
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
Thanks. And what are -
Whoa. Deja Vu.
Dorothy Parker--
You like her?
So what are you thinking for college?
College. Haven't really thought about it.
This seat taken?
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
You remember that story?
Yoooooow.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
You have to say that. You're my student.
Boys.
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.
When are you going to open your eyes?
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
Our penguin, right?
Do you think you'll find her?
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
Please. Please don't walk away.
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
Yes.
Why?
Josie, you look Rufus.
You ruined the whole thing!
Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
Aloha! Welcome!
Thank you.  I'm Rob.
Are you having fun?
Good. Gibby gave me champagne.
By name.
<i>                      I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
We followed your instructions.
He <u>has</u> to know...
Shock.
<i>                                   ... Let's draw straws.</i>
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
Not at all!
He sure is big, Jack...
Where're we taking him?
Yes.
If you went away, what would become of me?
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
Taste it.
No.
Uh-huh.
<i>                      Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
<i>                                     ... Birds of a feather.</i>
<i>                                          ... You're no fun.</i>
You'd better be quiet, Sandy.
You got your room straightened out yet?
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
Just out for a while.
I told you I want that room unpacked.
Oh, come on Dad...
It's not the gas, Dad!
He needs professional help.  I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.
Jesse, help!
Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
Wanna join your little friend?
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.
You two got a thing going, or what?
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
You got a problem with me, Grady?
Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
You remember your dreams, Grady?
I'm sorry...
What are you doing here?
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
What?
How come?
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?
Hi!  You didn't have to wait.
You okay?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
You mean a shithead.
You know her?
Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
I don't know.  Where are we going?
Here.
So, you feeling anything?
Any ghosts in here?
C'mon, cut it out.
I feel like a jerk.
Anything?
About what?
About not finding any bogey men?
What is it - What's wrong?
Whoa!
What is it?
It's gone now.
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
yeah, I had a bad night.
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
Why won't you talk to me?
Jesse, God - what happened?
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
Hi.
Jess?
So, school going alright?
Okay, I guess.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
Hi, guys.
All of them.
Yor dad picking the music again?
There's a Jesse on the phone.
You're going out?
We're going up to bed now.
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
I'll need to take her things.
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
Can't it wait till morning?
Morning, Doctor Goldman.
Menthol, regular, ultra-light.
Girl, what are you doing?
I gotta stay up, Max.
Horseshit.
I know who's trying to kill you.
So what do we do about this creep?
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
Do you still...see each other?
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
You did it the other night.
Freddy?
Joey needs us.  I can feel him.
What's that?
Kristen, can you pull us out?
Are you okay?
He's gone.  It's over.  Please don't die, Nancy.  Please.
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.
Can't be good news coming from you.
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
What are these, beauty marks?
Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
I don't know...
Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
Fred Krueger's dead.  You always had a little trouble understanding that, Princess.
It's over.  It's over.
I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
Ms. Thompson.
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
You're late.
Didn't get much sleep.
This is nice.
Sounds like a rough time.
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
With Hypnocyl?
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
I can't believe I just did that.
To who?
Then maybe you're ready.
For what?
The truth.
We can try again.
What are we going to do?
Assuming your mysterious nun in right.
Who would know where they were hidden?
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
Okay, straight talk only in here.
What about Kristen?
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
How do we get in?
What was that?
Somebody else is out here.
Science...I suppose.
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
How is he?
I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
Why is he after us?
We're here.
I'm in.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
I'm a vegetarian.
Wait a minute.  What about me?
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
That was such a great evening.
No!
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
God, that's an enormous arse.
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
Oh Jesus.
Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.
No thanks.
Coffee?
No.
Thank you.
Oh hi.  Forget something?
I forgot my bag.
Here we go.
Hello.  Hi.  Hi.
Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
Hi.
Hello.
Are you busy tonight?
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
Okay.
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
Too complicated.
That's fine.
Busy tomorrow?
Whoopsidaisies.
What did you say?
Nothing.
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't.
So who left who?
She saw through me.
I don't know, I'm afraid.
Here we are.  Do you want to come up?
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
You've got to go.
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
Hi.  Can I come in?
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
I have thought about you.
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
My son's name is Johnny?
Well, get a message through to him too.
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
With a goat playing a violin.
You've got big feet.
No.  What's that?
You have a stunt bottom?
Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
Oh please sod off.
You and every person in this country.
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
Can I stay a bit longer?
Stay forever.
What?
How do you think I'm doing?
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
This is certainly... ah...
I only found out you were here yesterday.
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
Hi.
Hello.
I thought I'd give it to you.
Thank you.  Shall I...
Yes...
Excuse me.
Yes.
Can I have your autograph?
What's your name?
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
He's bringing a girl?
Miracles do happen.
Does the girl have a name?
He wouldn't say.
That's right.
Anna Scott?
Yes.
The movie star?
... get fired.
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Bella -- this is Anna.
Still loves you though.
In a depressingly asexual way.
Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.
This painting isn't the original, is it?
Yes -- sort of...
That's nice.
Bernie -- this is Anna.
And we intend to use them!
Is this your first film?
No -- it's my 22nd.
Working with Leonardo.
Da Vinci?
Me?
Yes.  What do you think?
I was called and I came.  What's up?
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
What happened?
I'll see what I can do.
Still, not sparkling.
What's your name?
The others?
Mr. Thacker?
Yes?
Are you a fan of Henry James?
Ah... yes, enormously.
I did.
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
Topol.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
Martin -- your customer.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
Max.  This is Anna.
'No comment' means 'yes.'
No, it doesn't.
Do you ever masturbate?
So I get the brownie?
So -- you've laid the ghost.
I believe I have.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
Oh God no.
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
Hello.
No, sir.
How about Miss Flintstone?
No, sir.
Can I help you?
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Does she know you're coming?
Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
What are the choices?
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
There's something wrong with this yogurt.
Hey.
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
So -- any messages?
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Right.  No one else?
Try 'Flintstone.'
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Maybe.
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
Spike!
No -- you're right.
I wouldn't go outside.
Why not?
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
Which floor?
Are you sure you...?
Yes.
How was she?
Excuse me.
Bad news.
What book?
The one down your trousers.
Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
But you have no proof.
No, Miss Ratched...
And yet you suspect her.
Yes, that is correct.
M-m-m-ma'am?
Would you like to start?
Y-y-y-yes...
What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
Who? Tell me!
Get up, Billy.
Yes, ma'am...
Will you come with me, please.
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Sorry to have bothered you.
I wanna report a robbery!
On this ward?
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
Oh, I had them removed.
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
That's it! We made it!
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
Welcome back.
Thank you, ma'am.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Gotta go now, ma'am...
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Please see to Mister Bromden.
Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!
Whatcha boys playin'?
What's your name, buddy?
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
So long, kid.
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
I-I-I'm w-w-wet...
H-Hey, M-Mack.
Marry who?
In ya go...
Say it again.
Say... God Bless America!
Ca-na-da...
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Sock it to 'em, kid!
In there.
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
What for?
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
Let's go, for Christsakes...
Yeah, Mack?
Yeah, Mack?
Let me get on your shoulders.
Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
Where ya goin', Mac?
Where's Martini and Scanlon?
They must be up there!
There they are!
Yeah, where we going?
It's the questions she asks.
What?
Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?
I'll bet a dollar.
Neither do I...
Yeah, my feet are cold...
Ya know what, Fred?
Martini!
What are you doing?
What for?
Lobotomy!
Lobotomy?
Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!
With your own two hands?
Twenty-five dollars.
Giving up?
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
I'm busting outta this place.
What's your plan, Mack?
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
I refuse!
I said out!
No!
I'm the coach!
You can come back later!
I don't trust you!
No!
Let me see your hand!
Gimme a cigarette!
No!
Why not?
Hear what?
When?
Yesterday...
Yeah, buddy?
Can you borrow me a dime?
'Kay, place your bets.
Bet a nickel!
Right!
Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!
Yeah, Mac?
Whadaya doin', there's no one there!
Gimme the ball!
I saw thum! I saw thum!
I wanna see it...
I wanna go home!
Yeah, it's cold!
My turn.
Jesus God...
Gary Blinker's fulla shit!
He's not!
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Poker!
Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
I don't, Doc...
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
You bet, Doc!
Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
When?
Time out!
Time out!
Pardon me miss, but would you mind turning...
Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
'Kay!
Are you a doctor?
You look pretty healthy to me.
I'm the next one.
How do ya know that?
Because I quit breathing.
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
Up an' at 'em, Taber.
What's going on?
Oh, yeah?
Yeah!
How much ya wanna bet?
Got a cigarette?
Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?
A dime.
Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!
Yeah, what's up?
I thought I told you boys to go to bed!
Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!
Hey, how ya doin'?
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
What are they?
Please follow me.
You know, I never got your name.
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
Oh, yeah...
Who is he?
He's in charge.
Hi.
Yeah!
Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt.
Yes, I see it! I see it!
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.
After you, ma'am.
Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy...
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
Huh?
Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
How 'bout twenty?
Now you talkin'.
Bet you ass...
What kind of crap is that???
Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now!
Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.
Evenin', ma'am.
Is everything all right?
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
What are these men doing up wandering around?
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
What happened?
What's that?
What?
I thought so.
Is he in an asylum?
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
She was your sister.
No, she wasn't my sister.
Your mother.
Of course not.
May I see your boarding pass, please?
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
Why?
So, what's the story with your friend?
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
Were they pen pals?
--separate, in the evening..."
My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
Good.
You're sure...
We found each other, didn't we?
Yes.  We did.
Your great aunt.
Oh no.  Do you?
I'm a liberal!
There is one other thing you should know about me.
A very large pig.
...has a prior commitment.
What's mezzaluna?
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
We'll KNOW.
But, Faith--
But Faith--
You...
Congratulations.
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
Hello?  Is anybody there?
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
Who's this?
WAIT!!  Where are you?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
That's not the point.
You said whatever it was you would understand.
How could you do this to me?
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
NO.
Why can't you just tell me?
If it's any of your business, yes.
Yes.
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
You didn't answer my question.
So?
Why not?
Tell me.
I'd really rather not say.
Please.  I need to know.
Mickey Spillane.
Mickey Spillane?
Hi, Peter.
Oh.  That's nice.
And she's a knock-out, too.
Hey--
What?
What?...
What are you doing here?
You were saying...
Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.
How about music?  You like classical?
You okay?
Hi.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
No.  Are you're leaving?
Yes.  I am.
You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
Is something the matter?
There's no such thing.
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
Alright.  The truth is... I thought we had something here.
A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
What would you call it?
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
I was hoping for the real thing.
You're Damon Bradley?
Hello.
Beautiful place...
Been here long?
Tonight?
Any night.
I'll look forward to it.
Wait.
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
Sure.
Really?
Well, to-- new friends.
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
Faith, this is my mother.
Oh, hello.
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
I don't believe in statistics.
No.  He smokes.
How about the other one?  His friend.
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
Scientologist.
But somebody wrote those songs.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
No.
Is he married?
No.
What's he do?
I don't know, Kate.
You don't have any idea?
No.  He's never asked me.
Kate, is something the matter?
Larry brought me flowers last night.
Is that bad?...
Have you seen him with someone?
But it's July.
It's still the new year...
What about your job?
Live happily ever after.
This is a Lifestyles hotel.
Are you sure?
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
What are you doing?
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
Ah ha!...
What'd you find?
A Butterfinger wrapper.
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
We're saved!
What is it?
A phone message.  Only--
Only what?
You think he misses me at all?
Larry bought himself cologne?
Her brother.
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
Because I'm the one who's single.
I never even got to be single.
Is he looking at us?
What?
That was really sweet...
I meant about my idea.
Like a detective.
Hi-iii...
Hi.  Where've you been?
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Packing.
So, you've had a little bad luck.
I know, but...
It was a ouija board, remember?
What about Peter?...
Who said I was going?
No.  No, you go ahead.
Peter found him?
Joan Collins stayed here.
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
No one's perfect, Kate.
He's a jerk.
Kate is that you?
And Larry?...
And you are?...
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
It's siesta.
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
Giovanni.
Huh?
No, why?
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?
I came after the woman I love.
And you didn't tell her?
I have to talk to her.
She's not here.
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
Thanks.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
Sure we keep records!
Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you.
I wish I knew.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
Then don't.
Working hard?
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
Don't say that!
I could have been better!
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
Father Barry.
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
Terry...?
Give it to me my Pop's job
What makes him so special?
I think we're O.K.
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
They play pretty rough.
Which side are you with?
I'm with Terry.
I'll get home all right now.
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were
Man, you were a mess!
The moment I saw you.
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?
What for?
I don't know.
You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
The things that go on.
Listen, you like beer?
Wham... .
How do you like it?
It's quite  nice.
How about another one?
No thanks... .
A dive? You mean, into the water?
What a fruitcake you are!
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
You're not sore at me?
What for?
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
I can't let myself fall in love with you.
What are you going to do?
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
I don't rate it.
Edie... Edie... ..
Terry, what's wrong?
Who says?
Terry what's happening to you?
Told him what?
You... .
What I did to Joey.
Don't tell me don't tell me!
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
Edie...
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
Terry, for God's sake.
Get out of my way.
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
Thanks just the same.
But I feel like My friends won't talk to me.
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
You are like
Where you goin'?
But you've got to listen to me.
What are you going to do?
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
A question of who rides who.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
I want to see you, Terry.
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
Now don't give me a hard time.
Mind your own business, Father.
This is my business.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
You go to hell.
What did you say?
You can!
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but
You still call it ratting?
Are you on the level, Father?
You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
Never will be much too soon.
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
Such as what?
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
Raise a hand to me and... .
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
I told you lay off.
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.
She's a he. His name is Swifty.
Is Johnny in?
No.
Give me a double.
Take it easy now, Terry.
What's wrong with your shoulder?
No advice. Just whiskey.
Terry?  What do you want?
Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the last race.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
I'll bring him up to your loft.
Hey, Skins  --get away with that sheet metal all right?
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
Forty-five bills.
H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?
So-so, Johnny.
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
My favorite little cousin.
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
How'd you get that.
Go on beat it. Don't push your luck.
You got some nerve.
I was only talkin' to her.
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
Keep Charley out of this.
You don't think he'd be helpful?
Maybe I will one of these days.
If I could get my hands on you...
Leave her alone, I tell you!
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
Where?
In there.
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
Can't we get out of here?
I'm not sure...
Look!
Those creatures..!
Don't let them hear you.
I'm afraid I'll faint.
The ropes are coming loose.
Be careful!
I am--It's our only chance.
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
Yes I feel it in my bones.
I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?
You love me then?
But they are not yet one of us.
A situation easily remedied.
...And what is this?
A symbol, Master.
She came to us on the Day of the Dead.
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
She pleases me.  Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes. 
Well?
Ahh, she will be yours.
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
The moon is almost gone!
Ahh, there is yet time.
There are others.
Then cancel my order.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
The time...is short.
For what!?!
Your pleasures of course!
You mean...!
You may take her now.
Is there time?
You better hope there is.
Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
You know better than that.
We don't know of anything, Master...
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master
He wants us.
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
What do you suppose for?
I could make her another Cleopatra...
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
And the one driving the other car?
Oh, is this Adele?
Yes, it is.
I want to speak with you, please.
You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
You didn't visit him in prison.
He didn't want me to.
But you spoke to him on the phone.
He'd call every once in a while.
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Ask him his name.
Adele?  You in there?
Oh.  Uh-huh.
You did work for Emil, right?
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
You were his what, his box?
Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!
Go away, or I'll call the police.
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
They pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want, nobody'll know you.
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
What?!
I'm a tourist.
I guess Adele's in good hands.
Sure looks that way.
Let's go to Detroit.
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
Just hung up.
How long you talk to her?
How long were you with the girl?
Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
And she saw you?
You find out?
You know they gonna set us up.
Half for doing what?
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
There's still time, take me up on my offer.
You ever wear one of these?
They found the safe.
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
They look like plain old rocks.
Come <i>on</i>.
Shit.
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
And then they'll kill 'em.
We made it, didn't we?
I'm going back inside.
Hello, Daniel.
In the trunk, yeah?
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
I have to qualify, is that it?
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
You get the key?
You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
You're gonna use a ram?
Yeah, why?
Leave it where it is.
Put it down or I'll shoot.
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
What do you want to bet?
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
Ironic, isn't it?
How are you, Raymond?
Quite a mess.
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
Karen, I told you not to--
There a problem, Foley?
How much for your company at chow?
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
I bet.  How much?
We're leaving.
The fuck you talking about?
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
You know how to use one a these?
Good luck, Richard.
Not until recently.
Nervous?
Why you're just a girl.  What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
Where's your gun, your pistol?
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
That's funny.
You don't seem all that scared.
Of course I am.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
Uh-huh.
We still talk, though.
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
Really.
I mean, romantically.
You know who this is?
How'd you get this number?
Who was it answered the phone?
That's my dad.
Really.  He has a cop's face.
And your gun.
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
You won't do that.
Why not?
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
I can go to the bar.
Don't leave me.
You like bourbon?
Is that how you think of yourself?
What, as a sales rep?
I don't have a problem with it.
You did?
It smelled.
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
It's not a game.  Something you play.
Oh, God...
I called your room from downstairs.
You like taking risks.
You really wear that suit.
She did, huh.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
You believe that?
Where?
You were going to see her?
To warn her about Chino.
So she did help you?
You coming back?
Come on, Jack -- don't.
Pretend I'm somebody else.
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
You just did, for Christ sake.
Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
Oh, hey, Studs?  We thought you were somebody else.
Take your sunglasses off.
Wait in the car.
In the trunk?
Whose blood you got all over you?
I hear six.
When?
Looks like tonight.
Sounds high, doesn't it?
Thanks for your help.
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
It works.  You should try it sometime.
I still haven't made up my mind yet.
Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?
Foley?  That you?
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
You gonna write me a check?
I were you, I'd get up and run.
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
For a time.
Meaning?
Meaning time came, I left.
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
That time?
There were others.
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
I'll send it to you at Glades.
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
Take the next exit.
What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
Gee, I wonder why not.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
It's a guy you know.
You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
What-- when?
That was some shit, huh?
How's it going?
You're a fighter?
How you know that?
I can tell.
What's wrong with you?
Moselle Miller?
What do you want?
You like to sit down?
No.
Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.
He said he stayed here last November.
Here?  In this house?
Your dog was killed?
Got run over by a car.
Was a she, name Tuffy.
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
It's beautiful.
He's still married though, huh?
Technically.  They're separated.
Oh, he's moved out?
He's about to.
Then they're not separated, are they?
Can we change the subject?
No thanks.
You used to like it.
I really gotta go.
You were talking in your sleep.
What'd I say?
"Hey, yourself."
What are you thinking about?
No?
Was it Foley?
He's pretty laid back, confident.
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
You wave back?
I didn't have time.
You gonna go get him?
I told you, he isn't here.
Out for the evening?
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
How do I look, mama?
Did you pay the guy the reward?
Faux goose down.
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
Foley's got it.
We have a problem here?
...the fuck is this...
You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
Are you sure they're here?
What is it with Red?  I've never seen him this way.
He was that good?
I wish she could forget him.
Do you always stutter?
You're Walker, right?
Sir, I --
Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
Where's that lizard?
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
A m-missionary?
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
They ready, Earl?
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
Earl!  You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
It's Germans!
Good shooting, Rafe!
Land of the free...
Home of the brave!
How could you do this?
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
We gotta face some facts here.
I was grieving too.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
Get me into a plane!
What's there?
This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two!
They're all over us!
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
I'm out of ammo!
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
No.  You're trying to beat me.
It's not getting any longer.
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
Danny...
I can't make it.
Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
So beautiful!
Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium.
No baseball diamonds, Red.
I heard what you did.
We can explain, Colonel.
How'd you get this?
Boxin'.
Win?
What's your name?
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.
I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up.
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
Fook ya!
Learn English, then!
Hello, Lilla!
Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.
What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
Let's go.
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
Do you have to wear that hat?
Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve.
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
Carol!
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
The only one?
They're waiting. Come on.
I can't. It's all too much.
Where is it?
We're going to take you home.
I'll call you Later.
All right. What's the scoop?
Just what you underlined.
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
What's the matter?
It's that jerk Walter.
Lucky lady. Hi.
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
Charlie really has a great voice.
Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
And we're here on the couch...
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
But you love me don't you?
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
I know. Put Scott through college.
How do you feel?
You drive like a maniac!
Would you?
Looking good out there.
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
Yeah. Like that.
Where did you get that sweater?
Right. I promised my mother.
Is this slow enough for you?
Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved the way you kiss.  I missed you.
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
I'm sorry Charlie.
What do you know about classical music?
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
What am I going to do with you?
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
What are you doing here?
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
I just can't trust you anymore.
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
How'd you know about that?
Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
Does this mean you like me again?
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
Oh, Charlie.
I love you.
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
I've got to go now.
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
Come back to me.
Charlie? Was I dead?
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
I'll never give up.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Are you for real?
I beg your pardon?
Take a long walk on a short pier.
Okay.
Terry! Slow down.
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
Don't get your hopes up.
I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
What're you doing here anyway?
Coffee and a donut.
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
I can't do that.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
It's Charlie!
I thought I knew everything about him.
Young lady, you're drunk!
Damn that Charlie I
At my age? Don't be silly.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
Hi, Dad.
For me?
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
Quiet today?
This morning was good.
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
Jack, I was just trying to help.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
I have a note.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
When did you start drinking coffee?
Sort of.
What about?
Would you get that, dear?
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
What happened to you?
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
For what?
Maddy's party.
I'm not the maid!
Would they go over my girdle or under?
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
What are you doing?
Don't eat the red ones.
I remember that dress.
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
Dancing with you.
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
You're giving me the creeps.
Am I dead or not?
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
You're taking advantage of a minor.
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
Hi, Richard.
What are you doing?
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
What will they be made of?
In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
I couldn't help it  I loved him.
What's the matter?
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
Wait! I'll go with you!
That's Renee alright.
When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
What happened to you?
How long ago did this guy retire?
What?
Hey! Where're you off to?
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
All set?
So where're we going?
Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
Is this a good spot?
I'm not burying him here...
Why not?
What did?
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.
You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?
It's weird...
What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?
Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
You ever think about running away?
Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?
I know, Mom.
In a word, Bob...
I don't know what to do, Bob.
What in God's name... ?
Bob...
Allright. Calm down.
What was the file name?
Do you really think so, Andy?
Thanks, Walter.
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
Thanks, you guys.
Aren't you giving an exam?
It could be parasites, an infection...
You're going to the office?!
One hour!
Drew!
We're not skipping this treatment.
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
What's wrong with you?
Close the law book.
I'm not going to close the--
You don't think there's much time left, do you?
That's not what I said.
Maybe you should think about it.
What's that mean?!
Maybe you should think about it.
Ready for what, baby?
Thanks, Charles.
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...
About my blood work?
Innocuous?
Client of yours?
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
Whoa-oh!  Sorry, I...
It's okay. Can I sit down?
New baby?
One week old.
Congratulations.
Little baby girl.
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
Nine.
We?
My lover and I.
I buy that.
Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?
Who'd you get?
What?
Find a lawyer?
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
What's her name?
Rayisha.
There is no relevant precedent.
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
PARRTYY!
We're friends of Beckett's.
Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...
I'm a law suit.
Not bad.
Get it?
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
You think I'm uncomfortable...
Correct.
Uh huh...
Beckett?
Charles. Okay. Miller?
What?
I've considered that.
What happens?
I'll look over the Q and A.
Particularly, Charles.
A regular all-American guy?
I suppose you could say that.
Except... you were gay?
No. I didn't.
Are you a good lawyer?
I'm an excellent lawyer.
Yes.
What?
Thanks for coming by.
What can I do?
In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
Do you need a break?
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
Hello?
I'm fine.
Yes.
Ms. Burton. You're black.
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
We're going to draw blood.
Why are we going to do that?
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
A homosexual encounter.
Get real.
That's correct.
Were you pleased with his work?
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
What kind of people?
Good school. What year?
Second.
What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you?
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys?
You're the asshole, buddy.
How many gays do you know?
How many do you know?
Lots.
Duh...
Since when?
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
Whoa, whoa...  What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
Going on... like...?
Yeah. But we took care of him.
You taught him a lesson.
So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
Let's continue.
This would be a good time to break for the day...
Julius!
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it.
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
Don't wanna miss this.
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
Tell me that was you.
You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
Bring the light!
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
Three full bottles. But almost time to refill.
'Mean the whispers?
You did this? To yourself?
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Power cells.
But I just wanted to say --
We can, can't we? Trust you?
What do you see? Riddick?
Back to the ship, huh?
How many you see?
One or two.
As fast as you can.
You sure you can keep --
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
Just come with me!
Step aboard, Carolyn.
I can't....I can't....
Don't do this to me....
Just give me your hand.
You'd die for them?
What do my eyes see?
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
Christ, you don't know what's out there!
Like the light is scalding it.
Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
How many bottles?
Can we switch?
Hey.
Hey, who?
Amazing. I'm Johns.
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
Didn't bite.
Sorry. Thought I heard something.
Like what?
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
So why isn't it all bloody?
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --
60 years ago.
We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
I never said I was.
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
Smoke screen for what?
How much you weigh, Johns?
What the hell's it matter?
How much?
So you noticed too?
We cannot go through there....
Well? Is it just the pump?
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
You know who Muhammad was?
One is all?
Hasan?
They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
Imam. Slow down.
I would rather we all stay--
The sled as a shield....
Oh, no. No, no, no....
Where's Mr. Johns?
Which half?
What're you doin'?
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
SULEIMAN!
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
"God is Great," yes?
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
...then we saw this.
A toast to whatever he just said.
Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.
Very big beads.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
I'd rather piss glass.
Well, you got the big gauge.
Think about that reward, Johns.
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
<u>Fuck me</u>. You said "clear."
Said "looks clear."
Well, what's it look like now?
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
Not if I'm the one.
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
So which one caught your eye?
What's her name, anyway?
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
So much for your nightfall.
Take it.
What, it's broken?
Dr. Zaius --
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
Do you have any weapons?
The best. But we won't need them.
You still don't believe me, do you?
What are you doing there?
No.
What's so special about him?
Look -- she remembers.
Remembers what?
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
Now, just a minute --
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
The evidence was very meager --
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
Yo!
Geiger counter?
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
Which direction?
That way.
Any particular reason?
Objection!
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
Huh?
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
Landon! Send a last signal.
What signal?
It's no use ... there she goes.
Gone.
Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
Scarecrows?
Can we take a dip?
No cigar.
She comes along too.
Zira doesn't want your female.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
Shouldn't we be moving on?
Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
I think you're making a mistake.
He wouldn't leave her.
Who put them up?
What is that?
Why special?
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
One is in a museum!
Thats a lie!
This is a joke in very poor taste.
With one of them.
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
What is your proposal?
Of course.
Tell him to pull back!
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
Speak! Go on.	Speak again.
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
Shhhh!
What is this?
It's him...Landon.
You! ... You knew about this?
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
Maybe not.
What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
Why not?
Would you like to come along?
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
He's moving his fingers!
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
Do you believe him?
This is his assertion.
But there's the doll, sir.
Bunker...
Elias is dead. Join up with the platoon. Move it.
I SHIT on all o' you.
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
We got boo-coo movement. 3rd Battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here. 
So what's the problem?
That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have.
You lame Taylor?
What?
Where's he from?
Where's Elias come from?
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Taylor! Francis!
Rhah! What's going on. Rodriguez's hole just got...
La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!
Where's Lerner?
Come on man!
Hey Taylor, you okay man?
But what'd she actually do?
Dawn! That was it!
...don't feel like it either.
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
I'll go with you.
Okay - got light duty, three days.
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
I volunteered.
What are the heads?
You volunteered for this shit man?
What we got here a crusader?
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
What are you talking about! 
Merle?
Whew! - where that come from?
Found it. Growing in a garden.
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
You wanted to see me sir?
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
You could tell me your name. And where you're going.
How far does this train go?
Vancouver, B.C.
Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.
I really don't know.
Indefinitely?
I don't know.
Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.
Very nice Mitchell turns.
No thanks?
Not tonight.
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
Don't I even get my face slapped?
Would you mind?
I think I'd like to dance.
I think you're drunk.
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
Good morning. Can I do something for you?
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
And do you amuse the guests?
Would it make you anymore amusing?
Whatever you say.
Do you think I don't?
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
They'll know whether he killed himself.
I don't.
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.
You tried to run away.
There wasn't any plane.
Want a spike in it?
Bad?
Bad enough.
He could hardly help suspecting you.
What time is it?
Certainly not to me.
Want to dance?
Dance? Here?
I didn't notice him.
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
Couldn't be.
Absolutely sure.
You don't know who he is?
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
Us?
All right--following me.
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
Nothing matters.
So have I.
It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
No percentage in that.
They're going to arrest me.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
If you're doing all this just for me.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
I think you mean that.
Do you think I was faking?
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Beer?  Well, all right.
Beer or ale, Miss?
Ale. I don't mind.
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
I'll have to know a little more than that.
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
What this?
Yes.
Where's you get it?
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
FLorida?
We wouldn't have met at all.
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
You've had dealings with the police before?
You were there when I last saw him.
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
This isn't a very good place to talk.
I don't want to talk.
Points very straight to her.
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
Time's up.  I'm off the case. 
They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
To do what?
What will they do to you?
No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
I'd like a few words with you, in private.
You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
Bluff. You've waited too long.
For five hundred, what do I get?
A thousand.
Got it on you?
Got the information on you?
Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
What'll you have, Margo?
Martini.
Sometimes.
And without much discrimination.
Leave that one lay.
What's a buzzer?
Who told you my name?
What?
The usual grind.
Round of golf Saturday?
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
Thank you.
I don't.
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
Could we discuss that some other time?
A couple of hours.
Would that make me a heel?
You'd be breaking the law.
Doesn't answer the question.
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
It could have been an accident.
That COULD BE TOLD.
No more for me, thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
Mr. Mitchell.
A little something on account perhaps?
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
I don't think you locked your door.
Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him.
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
Send that?
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
What do I get for it?
You in charge here?
So it seems Sergeant.
... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
I'll know when I find it.
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.
Not too hard, is it?
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
Was that about the right angle?
I think so.
Where's the shell?
Do I know who lives down there?
This is the shell.  What about the gun?
May you what?
Oh nothing.
Scotch and plain water, I think.
I never saw it before.
What about me?
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
No doubt about that one.
How about Magruder?
He checks too.
That leaves two strangers.
So far.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
The card says so, doesn't it?
I hear she's a very pretty girl.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
I don't know, sir.
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
But you still think she's innocent.
Get out of here!
I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.
So-so.
Who's the girl?
Why should I mind?
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
I have a rough idea.
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
What's this?
What does it look like?
How long have you had it?
You already have the checks, darling.
Of course.
How about your new friend?
Right.
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
I do worry about Susan.  Have you known her long?  She hasn't mentioned you.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
Shall we go?
Thank you.
Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?
I'm not sure I can face it.
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
Committed to memory.  Forever.
Attributed?
Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
I'll have some of that.
...break away completely from--
Yes...You're not a socialist then?
No.  I'd want to--
Are you going to have coffee?
So it's all worked out perfectly...
What did you think of that Wadja film?
I thought it was tremendous.
I think it went on rather too long.
I couldn't bear for it to end.
And I didn't like that man.
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.
Damn.  They're early.
Who?
I called you a taxi.
Very thoughtful.
I have to be up early. 
In radio we're different.
I think she liked me.
Did she talk about me?
I haven't really thought about it.
I might.
That'll be fun
In your car
Shall we have a drink or something?
Not here.
To the airlift.
To the airlift.
Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.
To the Fleet.
To the Fleet.
And the Argies.
Now, top secret file.
It's shit.
You approve!
That's enough of that.
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
Still in love?
Hello.
Hello.
Why not sit down and wait?
Oh, I see.
Have you come to talk about me?
What period?
What about the Cromwells?
It's that lady from Norfolk again.
Hello, Jimmy.
Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like.  She keeps asking when you're coming...
No, thanks Dad.
I've got to be going.  I've got a meeting tonight.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
No.
Yes.
What would you call it?
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
Jeremy!  How Fantastic.
Darling Susan.
Don't point it at James!
What have you got there?
Promise?
I won't.  Goodnight.
Ah, Susy, it...
Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter.
Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
Thanks for stepping in.
Where?
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
I gotta be fucking crazy.
Ever done this before?
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
You gotta earn trust.
We gonna jump or jerk off?
Utah, you copy bruddah?
Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
You gonna pull?
Don't screw around man, pull it!
You do it... you first!
You first!
I'm not armed.
You gotta tell me where she is.
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
Three seconds... two... one...
Wild ride, huh?
I'm not FBI anymore.
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world--
How was the beach?
Fine.
Surf conditions okay?
Babes.
They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
They don't go for the vault?
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
Big zippo so far.  How about you?
Got it.
Aw shit.
They're on their way to Maui.
Time for lunch.
The hell are they?!
Nothing?
I know where they're going.
Angelo!  Don't fire!
Kid, get outta the way!!
What do you want?
Who's the girl?
Catch of the day.
What's goin' on?
I can barely do this in broad daylight.
Those are cold.
Ouch.
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
So what'd the other guy look like?
Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?
Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
My name's Johnny Utah!
Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
No way, old buddy.
Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
You're wastin' your time.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.
Thanks.
... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
You saw what?
You're looking well, Dutch.
Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
There's something else, Major...
Hawkins?
What in God's name...?
I think it's Hawkins.
Where the hell is his body?
Your uncle will like this.
He's not really my uncle.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
Please, we hardly know each other.
No.
What's that long building over there?
Storage, I think.
Congratulations, sir.
You've got a lot of nerve.
Mr. Harris.
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
What's that?
You looking' for some company?
No, you look like a hooker.
Sure.  For five bucks.
Sit... and spin.
Nice car.  Yours?
No.
Stolen?
Mind if I turn on some heat?
Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.
You're not from L.A., huh?
New York.
What motel you staying at?
<u>Ho</u>tel.
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
It pays.
So do day jobs.
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
For the whole night?
For an hour.
You're joking.
Three hundred.
Fine.
What's your name, lover.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Get in.  This side.
Off the boulevard.
Room service.  What do you drink?
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Can I have some chips?
Do you plan everything?
Let's talk some more first.
Uh-huh.
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
And why do you say that?
I think he wanted you to tip him.
Where are they?  Shopping together?
It's a very good year.
Try a strawberry.
You really are a very beautiful girl.
Just a romantic, that's you.
Did you sleep well?
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
No?  Why's that?
I buy companies.
I sell them.
By breaking up a company's assets --
It'd cost you.
Of course.  How much?
But you want days too.
All right, two thousand.
Three.
Done.
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
Never answer the phone.  Ever.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
Did you buy some clothes?
I got a dress, yeah.
The Rex.
Any good?
And that's the way the game is played.
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
I have work to do.
I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
Okay.
Good.
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
You always been rich?
You still mad at'm?
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.
I think it's exciting.
What id we run into someone I know?
Real genuine guy.
You asshole!  I can't believe what a --!
Do I look okay?
Edward, I can't.
Shush.  Of course you can.
What if I lose it?
What if someone tries to steal it?
Huh?
I know.  I'm glad.
One more night and you're finally rid of me.
I've never treated you like a whore.
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
I got tired of hating my father.
I didn't think so.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
Cynthia's not coming?
Love this car!  Is it new?
Edward, did you hear me?
Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
But, Edward...
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
Doing what?
Did I wake you?
You broke my nose.
I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
'Lo.
Kit!  Where've you been?
In Beverly Hills?
Yeah.
Was that you?
Who did you think?
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.
It was great.
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
Want a pair of boots?
You sure you won't come with me?
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
Yeah, what?
Kit give me nothin'.
You bullshittin' me?
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
Oooh, I love those.
I'm just going to my room.
You're a guest here?
And who is that?
What's your name?
I got a dress.
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
I think you'll find it normal enough.
Will I like it?
You'll like it fine.
But I always eat like this.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
What if they serve soup?
They will serve salad.
But what if they serve soup?
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
I like steak.
Hi, Barney!
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
Yeah, well, I check out today.
May I help you?
Are you looking for something in particular?
Yes.  Something... conservative.
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
What is with you?
Excuse me?
Yes?
Do you remember me?
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
Having a good time, Vivian?
Then I'm here till I die?
Till they kill you. Yeah.
He will come for me.
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
Should I be?
Brides often are, I'm told.
I killed him myself.
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
He knows I do not love him.
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
With pride. What can I do for you?
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
Does it bother you to hear?
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
I fear I'll never see you again.
Of course you will.
But what if something happens to you?
Hear this now: I will come for you.
But how can you be sure?
I will never doubt again.
Singed a bit, were you?
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
We did it.
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
It never happened.
What?
Did you say, "I do"?
I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
You're quick.
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
I only dog paddle.
What do I do?
He's really very short on charm.
FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?
Hello.
It's you.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
How many could you handle?
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
-- Fezzik, please --
The body?
Have you any money?
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
Will this do?
Inigo.
What?
He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
I brought you a special present.
What is it?
-- wait, just wait --
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
Oh no. No, please.
They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?
Someday, you may not mind so much.
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
Who gets Humperdinck?
Yellin.
It won't be easy, Sire.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
Your guess is as good as mine --
Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
And it is guarded by sixty men.
And our assets?
Now?
Now?
Where's Fezzik?
No --
-- yes --
-- all that I have and more please --
-- offer me everything I ask for --
Sir. Sir.
Thank you for everything.
Sorry.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
You don't know any way you'll trust me?
We'll wait until you're ready.
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
I admit it -- you are better than I am.
Because I know something you don't know.
And what is that?
Tell me.
Who are you?!
No one of consequence.
I must know.
Get used to disappointment.
Making sure nobody's following us.
Go in, get after her!
I want to duel him left-handed.
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
Yes.
I accept.
Inhale this, but do not touch.
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
Then make your choice.
"True love." He said, "true love," Max. My God --
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
Nobody's hearing nothing!
Yeah, an hour.
Have fun storming the castle.
Think it'll work?
You feeling any better?
A little bit.
What?
Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
You are sick, that's why he's here.
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.
"By the light, by the light,
"Of the silvery moon,
"Of the silvery mooooon,
"I want to croon,
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
"Honeymoon,
"Honeymoon, honeymoon,
Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
I'll wait in the hall ...
Oooooooops!
Do the books!  Do the books!
I have hurt your feelings.
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
Well, sir, it seems ...
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
What is that?  A handkerchief?
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Yes, what?
What you were saying.  Keep talking.
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
Will you get a hold on yourself.
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
I already have.  Come on.
Right.
Everybody's a big shot.  Well, Leo, are you having a good time?
You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket.
Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
What is she gonna do here?
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
Do you think he'll take the job?
So much for Nutsy Fagin.
To failure!
Maybe it's not true!
No way out.  No way out.
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
I never should have listened to you.
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
What???
Max, I...
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
Yes.
Yes.  We would!
Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down.
Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
Come on.  Let's get going.
Min Bialystock.
Come on.  We'd better hurry.  We're late.
Call chauffeur.  Get car.
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
You, Blum go Motel.
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees.
Finder's keepers.
Oh, the best one.
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.
Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
I solemnly swear...
By the sacred memory...
By the sacred memory...
Of Siegfried...
Wagner...
Wagner...
Bismark...
Hindenburg...
Hindenburg...
The Graf Spee...
The Graf Spee...
The Blue Max...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Heil you know who!
Heil you know who!
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
Where are you going vit the light?
I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody calls me LSD.
We are falling back on all fronts. Our soldiers are retreating.
Who can we attack?  They're all too big.
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
What did you tell the people?
I told them we invaded England.
We won.
I'm not the police.
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
Very early. Dawn.
Of which morning?
The following morning. Sunday.
No.
Back where?
How did she pay you?
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
She isn't still here, is she?
I live there. Alone.
Of course not.
If she paid you well?
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?
Let's all talk about Mary.
Why?
Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
Casharoonie!
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
Yes, Mr. Lowery.
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
She stole some money.
A lot?
Forty thousand dollars.
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
What difference does that...
Did he say anything about my sister?
Yes?
May I talk to you?
I'm Mary's sister.
Lila.
Here?
With you.
What's the matter?
What should I know?
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
I was getting to that!
What do you know about it?
What thing?
What thing could we be in together?
I hate tears. 
Is Mary... in trouble?
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
You want me to stay here?
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
I feel better when you feel better.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Arbogast said...
Sam! Why call when we can go?
Probably on his way back right now.
Sam, I'm going.
Just wait here?
He didn't come back here?
Without calling me?
Let's go see Al Chambers.
Who's he?
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
Of course we will.
Watch your tenses.
Sorry.
Hospital clean.
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
You can't go up there.
Why not?
It's regular. Okay?
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
I've lost my girlish laughter.
The only girlish thing you have lost.
Sam. This is the last time.
Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
You can't laugh at it, huh?
I have to go, Sam.
I haven't even been married once yet!
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
Don't miss your plane.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
You eat like a bird.
Uncommon, too.
Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
I'm looking for a private island.
What are you running away from?
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
You should... mind it.
A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 
Why don't you go away?
To a private island, like you?
Thank you, Norman.
Very early. Dawn.
Alright, Miss... 
Crane.
That's it. 
You slept here all night?
No, m'am.
Then I'm free to go...?
Frankly, yes.
Please... I'd like to go...
I'm sorry.
Wait a minute!
May I see your license?
Why?
Went out before service.
Just coming up to ring for you.
I'll take you to...
I'll get your bags.
Haven't any.
Satisfied with your cabin?
My mother is not dead!
You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
Leave me alone!
...Forty thousand dollars!
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
They thought she'd be coming to me.
Yes.
You didn't find anything.
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
Just before she died she came to--
Did she talk?
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
Who are you? What is your name?
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me--
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
How do you do.
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
I'm going to call the police.
What is it?
The wound is bleeding!
What is it now?
You're losing your blood?
Yes!
What were you dreaming about?
A voice ...
That spoke to you?
That called ... commanded ...
Yes!
Did you hear?
The child!
Yes.
There's no child here.
No?
You killed him!  Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
But what about lunch?
I think so.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
I won't let you say that!
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
So that's the way it is?
That's the way I feel about it.
We'll be coming to the opening.
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
What! What are you talking about?
What do you think I am?
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
It happens that I'm the law.
As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
And they never proved anything against him.
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Which one is me? The horse?
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
I am right! I know I'm right!
Now don't that call for an extra!
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
We'll grant that.
No kiddin'?
Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
I don't remember. Not so very far--
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?
Call the Homicide Squad!
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
No foolin' -- any suspect?
Do you know George Winton?
Old Howard Winton's cub?
That's the one.
They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
It's all yours.
He might get some publicity out of it.
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
That happens to be the truth.
There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
How much money have you got?
What is it? What happened?
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
But I have some friends waiting.
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
Shall we unpack it?
I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor.  I think I'll have somethin' to tell you soon.
She is the soul of that statue.
What are you laughing at?
Yep. Everything settled.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
I've been dreaming about you.
I'm heading out of town.
Could you?
Where to?
A place you've never been.
Why am I doing this?
Could be.
What universe are you in, Paul?
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
I've been dreaming about this.
Yes?
Nobody.
But who were they?
They were just bad men, that's all.
In what sense were they bad?
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
You better quit that.
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
You're going to get yourself up and go out?
Yeah.
You won't die, Rose.
What are you going to do, Rose?
Yeah, I know.
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
I do, too!
All right, what do you know?
You were up late last night, Brother.
Son, was Rose in your room last night?
I don't know.
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
Yeah, he's still up there.
Open that door, damn you!
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
What did you say, Brother?
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
She's getting herself up to go out.
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
I think Daddy suspects.
She's watching the car again?
There goes Mother.
I think she's gonna kiss him.
They're discussing it.
This is my place and you can't have it.
Wow! Brrrother!
What are they doing?
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
What are they doing, Doll?
Is that all?
He had his hand on her titty.
She's putting the titty back.
No, Mother, he's lying...
Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
Then why does she act so dumb?
Why is it taking so long?
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
That's what she would say herself.
No, son, she is dead.
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
Of course.
I think we both know her.
Turn up your hearing aid.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.
Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother.
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
Well, she's back.
What time is it?
Quarter of twelve.
Is she all right?
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
Well, time will tell, won't it?
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
Darlin', Rose has got to go!
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
How is she?
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Rose, what are you doing up?
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Is anything wrong?
No, sir.
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.
Got yourself up?
How can the buttons stand the pressure?
You were up late last night, too, Rose.
Oh, anywhere downtown.
You don't know where you're going?
Strange voices, Rose?
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
Tennessee?
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
Mine.
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
Yes, I am.
No, you're not.
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
I don't believe it.
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
Tell me about that job in Alexandria, Dave, the big motel you're building.
What's the matter with him?
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Well, you run on now.
I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.
Never again, never again...
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
No more dentists, no more dentists...
Rose, you don't have to.
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.
You're not gonna see him again.
Indivisible and inseparable.
What and?  That's what I got.
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
This is private property.  This is breaking and entering!
What... ?
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
How's your precious little school-marm today?
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
Lay off once, would you?
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
You shouldn't litter.
Thank you, concerned citizen.
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento.  Nothing special.
That wasn't my fault.
I... I can't find my seatbelt.
I can work this.
No you can't.
Make a hole, Billy-Boy.
Relax.
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
Ah, jeez, Billy... careful!
"A.D."
Okay, we got... one, two... three...  Two Caddies and Poe's Mustang.
That's them trying to kill us.
Clench your teeth.
What?
Name one.
Dean Martin.
Who's been giving you history lessons?  Your bartender?
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
They shot us all, kid.
What day is it?
Where we going?
How you doing back there?
Gimmie a butt.
Happy Independence Day.
Why do I always have to sit in back?
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
Wha... ?
It doesn't say that.
That's him alright.
Smooth move, hot-shot.
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.
Where we going?
I can't believe we're stealing.
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
You live like a pig.
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
No.
General Jim Beam, then.
You could start over again with cash like that.
There probably is.
He tried to kill us.
There'll be other chances.
Our resignations.
You going rogue on me?
I... I think I can... clarify...
Pure horse.
Arriving tonight
You know... you could say thank you.
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
Alright?
We got him.
I'm gonna get beside.  Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.
You... SUCK!  You almost got us all killed!
Can't be worse than you.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
You get him?
Been waiting long?
Just got here.
How'd we do?
Get his attention.
We're screwed.
You John-Wilkes-Booth-ed him.
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
Know what I love about dynamite?
The gang's all here!
You see that?
You always did have style.
It's one of a kind.
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
I can't see.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Where am I?
Jabba's palace.
As you wish.
I told you to remain on the command ship.
Han!
Luke!
Are you all right?
Wouldn't miss it.
How are we doing?
The same as always.
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
Luke.
You got her warmed?
I don't know.  Fly casual.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
I thought she was with you.
Someone who loves you.
What's going on?
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
He wasn't. I can feel it.
Han! Chewie?
Lando, grab it!
Lower it!
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
Here we go again.
Come on! Come on!
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
All wings report in.
I'm going in.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
Oh!
Over there! Two more of them!
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
What do you remember?
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
He's my father.
Yes. It's you Leia.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
I know, father.
Come with me.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
Yoda, I must know.
Told you, did he?
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Yes or no will do.
Oh. Well, yes.
Do you have any tattoos Brad.
Certainly not!
Why you - what have you done with Janet?
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
You promise you won't tell?
He might be.  I don't know.
Janet!
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
Yes Brad.
I've got something to say.
Oh Janet
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?
Brad, please lets get out of here.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
It's just a..a party Janet.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
Weiss.
Brad...
No, don't do that.
Maybe we could try it this way.
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
Good God.
You did right.
A decision had to be made.
You're OK by me.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
Promise you won't tell Brad.
What a guy
What guy
"Sweet Transvestite"
From Transexual Transylvania.
Was all I had to say
Now I
Want to come again and stay
Oh my, my,
Oh, no no, no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Oh no no no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Who's Eddie?
I thought you liked them.  They liked you.
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
...I'm sorry.
...I don't know.
It's Thanksgiving.
Looks quiet, y'know.
I just dislocated my finger.
D'you really wanna call?
Yes, I do.
You sure?
I think he might be worried.
It's fine.
It's only temporary.
I don't think I belong here.
It's okay.
No, I don't belong here.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
What?
...T-thank you.
I always knew you was pretty.
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
Ya puttin' me on, right?
'Bout seven.
Yes.
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
Don't want weak legs.
...And he called the reporters --
Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
...Are you going to say anything to him?
Wanna hear a dirty joke?
What did you say about a pet shop?
Is everything all right?
...Can't do it.
...What?
...I can't beat him.
Apollo?
What're we going to do?
...I dunno.
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
Oh, Rocky!
Christ.
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
Don't talk like that to him!
You busted?!
You's the novelty, Champ!
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
My side.
Get that doctor.
No doctor!
You're hurtin', man!
Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.
You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man!
...It's very American.
How 'bout this Billy Snow?
Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.
...Still don't feel no heat.
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
How was the flight, Champ?
Hear she's retarded.
She ain't retarded, she's shy.
I don't like ya face.
Don't like yours neither.
Kiss my ass.
Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
No dollar.
...That's an old one.
We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun.
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
Few minutes?
...Ten minutes.
Six!
How 'bout some Cokes?
...How 'bout for the Cokes?
I say ya nothin'!
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
What's ya name again?
A hundred an' thirty.
That's it, I'm broke.
That's it.
You think I don't hear things?
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
Mr. Balboa --
No -- Just me.
Sparrin'?
Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?
...Screw you.
What'd you say?
What?
Make your teeth yella --
I like yella teeth.
Makes your breath like garbage.
Listen, I hope ya don't --
I won't.
Goodnight, Rocky.
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
I said, how ya feelin'?
...What?
How old?
Come July, twenty-five.
...Did ya fight last night?
Yeah --
Did ya win?
Yeah, Kayo.
...Who'd ya fight?
Spider Rice.
Rice is a bum.
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
Think about it.
Did ya get the message, kid?
Ya puttin' me on?
Here's the card?
When was they here?
'Bout an hour ago.
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.
Yeah.
What's happened is freak luck.
Whatta' those?
How 'bout a glass of water?
Really think so?
Ya got heart.
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
I got pain an' experience too.
Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.
Don't you care what the people will say?
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
Don't let 'im get you tight.
God bless ya, Rock.
Ya nose is broke.
How you holdin' up, kid?
Wanna keep goin'?
Would you keep goin'?
How I look out there, Mick?
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
It ain't your locker no more.
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam.
No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more.
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
How's Butkus this mornin'?
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
My sister's a friggin' loser.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
...Maybe I better forget it.
What's ya sister like to do?
Ice skate.
It don't matter.
He's takin' cheap shots.
Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
How ya feelin'?
...Tight.
I got whiskey here.
Whatta you think?
What?
Ya really like her?
Sure I like her.
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
You ballin' her?
Whatta these guys want?
...I can't haul meat no more.
Apollo's a great fighter.
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
We don't serve formula. Snookums.
You serve martinis, doncha?
Well, I'll be...
Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
What's this, Roger?
Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
Is this paper even good?
Check the scrawl.
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
Do you think the rabbit did it?
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
So you decided to help him after all?
What was <u>that</u>?
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
Maroon, right?
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
What's that comin' from the bar?
I'll bet.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
Holy shit, he's a Toon!
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
No...
Does it hurt?
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know who I could trust.
Where is he?
Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
Hold on a second.
What the hell is that?
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
One too many safes dropped on his head?
The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
I got him on loan from Disney.
When will I hear from you?
Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
Have you got the will?
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
No, I don't.
You tricked me, damn you!
Aah!
What the hell are you doin'?
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?
Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
Does this help?
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
Say, who's this guy laughin'?
Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
I'll get it.
Wrong number?
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
Two bits.
Yeah?
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
No better?
Have patience!
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
Then I'll leave thee.
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
A challenge, on my life.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
By my head here come the Capulets.
Good-morrow, cousin.
Is the day so young?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Out--
At thy good heart's oppression.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Every man betake him to his legs.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
Young Romeo is it?
I'll not endure him.
He shall be endured
My poverty, but not my will consents.
Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
Welcome.
Where is my Lady's lord?
Goodnight.
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Speakest thou from thy heart?
Amen
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
So thrive my soul--
By the hour of nine.
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
Why, may one ask?
I dream'd a dream to-night.
And so did I.
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
A most courteous exposition.
Pink for flower.
I will follow you.
I thought all for the best.
A Plague o' both your houses.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
This is important.
Do you really think so?
It's under your seat.
We kept it...
And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.
Well I don't!
Who the fuck are you?
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
It's been known to happen.
Not to me, you know that.
From Interpol?
Lose them!
About time!
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.
I still am.
Is that right?
I better be getting that.
Duty calls?
I'm a patriate.
I didn't say I was.
Are you alright?
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
Where's the case?
Don't do it, Sam!
We'll double your price.
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
Do you have the material?
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
Do you have it?
Not so fast.  Who's that?
He's company.
Bad company...
Here's yours.
There's been a slight problem.
Where's my information?
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
And more importantly --
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
But you hate each other!
Bullshit!
I swear...
Then where is it?
I sent it to myself in Paris.
Sent it where?
Is it done?
Gregor, is that you?
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
That's it.
Then I guess we're set.
There is one other thing...
What are you doing?
Don't cross me...
Nobody's going to do that!
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
He's tough, your American friend.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
And you respect him.
You think you can stitch me up on you own?
Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.
He sees this differently, as you well know.
So this is what, a test?
If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.
You shoot alright.
Not for long.
Long enough to shoot back.
Is that right?
Yeah, well...  My way works too.
You should watch what you eat.
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
I ride with fat-boy...
Where is this broad?
You should learn a little patience.
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
Perhaps the police?
Cigarette?
He trusts you to lock up?
I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.
To see a man about a thing.
Pretty much what you'd expect.
He says this is their block.
As in, they own it?
I didn't know that you spoke French.
What'd you say to him?
Jujitsu.
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
Like Larry or Swede.
So is the woman.
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
I wanted to see who you were.
What's going on?
How did you know?
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
It was at that.
A lot of people died.
I've seen a lot of people die before.
I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
Not exactly.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
You don't have to do this.
Alright, it's done.
You see the bullet?
You know him?
The Irish representative?
You sure your friend got the right place?
Dark ops?
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
Very ugly.
I never made that claim.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
How could you have done that?
Right now?
I'm not here very much.
Business keeps you on the road?
So I do it.
No you don't, and you know it.
In a minute.
Do we need anything else?
Time to quit.
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
That's a good question.
Do you have a good answer?
You have to stop doing that!
Let's get him out of here...
And now...
You son-of-a-bitch...
What?
You speak French.
What of it?
I know.
You better get some sleep, alright?
What happened to it?
Gone.  Destroyed.
Gaelic.
You sure?
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
It's the Irish tape we want.
Why didn't you kill her?
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
You put everything on the line because you...
My man, how you doing?
I'm alright.  And you?
Do you have the tape?
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
Can you get it?
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
I don't know what you're -
Ready to roll, partner?
Thanks for the loan, man.  I'll have it in a few days, I promise.
Never heard of it.
What the hell...
What are we going to do?
What do you mean what are we going to do?
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
Well someone's gonna find them.
It won't work.
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
That's right!
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
I've got one condition.
Shhh!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
I...I can't do that.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
It's the right thing to do.
I should have known something like this was going to happen!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
What are you thinking?
I can't do that.
He would have done it to us, right?
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
He's going to be trouble.
You're out of your mind.
You think he's bluffing?
No.
Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
Not bad enough to kill him.
How long is it going to take?!
You killed him...
It's gonna be o.k.
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
Maybe we should say somethin'.
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
Do you have everything?
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
Then we're screwed.
We've got to go now, then.
That's right.
He killed her...he killed her...
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
It's too late...
Uh huh.
And you're solid on that?
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
Why don't you get to the point.
Two thousand...
You don't expect us to believe that do you?
Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!!
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
Shut up, Jesse.
How are ya?
No.  Why?
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
What's that?
Has he?
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
Hi.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
OK.
Are you sure you're OK?
He's not, he's...
You're worth every last penny.
How the hell did he find it?
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
So do I.
I love you Sally.
When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
I don't believe it.
Sally, do you love me?
Yeah, I've seen him.
Be more specific.  A month, a week...
A week ago, at most.
Test the product?
What?
All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.
I don't know.
I guess we can get started.
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Sheriff Hogan --
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Hello.
Anything I can help you with?
Anything...specific?
I don't suppose you've seen her.
Have I seen her?
Uh...C?
C?
Yeah I'd say C...C.
Very clumsy, very clumsy.  Id have found it in a minute.
Aw, now thats gonna take time to clear!
Jesse?
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
Something wrong, Jesse?
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
What's this?
Hey where's the hot pad?
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.
I didn't say that.  You did.
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Don't you want to hear about my day?
You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
Dwayne put the gun down --
You'd do this to me?!
Dwayne -
We're out of here.
Well you're not getting, either.
What do you mean?  You gambled it?
I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
Hi ma.
I didn't know you were coming.
I was in the neighborhood.
How's work?
At least around here it does.
This whole place?
Well I don't know --
Anything in it?
There was more than that.
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
You think he skipped town?
This isn't right...
What the hell is that?
Winner six!
How much is that?
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
What??  Where'd you hear that?
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
Is this about the funny money?
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
So what's your story?
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
I'm busy at the moment.
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
Oh, you American?
That's right.
You get massage from Chinese girl before?
No.  It's my first time.
Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
Those girls drove off because of you.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
I knew you were lying.
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
You lied to me.
Hello.
What's wrong?
Goddamn you got a small ass.
Carter?
Who died?
You.
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
Not Yu.  You!
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
No.  She's a school teacher.
Good at what?
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
IT IS CRAZY!
It sounds impossible --
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
He'll be back soon.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
Slow down, baby.
What did you say?
Is it hot in here?
She's getting undressed.
Gimme the binoculars.
No.  It's not right.
What's she doing?
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
I don't understand?
Pick it up!
Wait!  There's people down there!
Get it out of here!
I wouldn't do that!!!
Why did you help me?
I think we should stop talking.
Mind your own business.
No mu-shu.
What about a little king pao chicken?
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
Are you serious?
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
Hello, Benjamin.
Who's Benjamin?
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
We're slowing down.  This must be it.
End of the line.
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
Carter...here comes the rich white man.
Lee!
I did!
No you didn't!
Ricky Tan is alive.
Carter...
We made it, man.
That your gate down there?
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
New York City?
First class.
The Plaza Hotel?
A little Mu-shu.
I could use a little vacation.
Put your arms around me.
What's going on?
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
You move well.
Just trying to make it look real.
Why don't you go get them?
Are you okay?
Master Ching taught me.
Do you still have the bills?
All he wanted was some mu-shu.
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
Shut up!
He stole my wheel!
Tell me about it.
He was just doing his job.
You have one of these?
You speak English!
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
It's the same thing!
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
-- what the hell is that?
That silly-ass look on your face.
Where were we?
It was not my intent --
What about them?
You make the plate?
What plate?
The license!  You get it?!
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
Stooly.
What?
You talk too fast.
Let's go.  Everybody take off?
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
You like it?
Now, that's American music.
Yes, I know this song.
Want some?
No, fish is a PM food.
What?!
Which one?
This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.
This concrete?  This is still America.
Oh no.
What?
Oh my god. Griffin.
No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
Not anymore.
I could get promoted right out of here.
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find em.
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
You don't like it?
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
Yeah. So why you look do down?
Any demands yet?
At this point we don't have much.
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
Shut up!
You a cop or something?
I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
You sonuvabitch.
Where do we find him?
Hello.
Ambassador Han.
My daughter.
She's fine.
Hello.
Han?
Yes.
It's Griffin.
You have what I asked for?
Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
What is he up to now?
See you at the wedding.
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
What do you expect me to say to this?
Got any last minute advice?
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
That's it.  Back to obedience school.
And in a "V".
We do it to our dog.
It's hurting.
I'll get the dress.
"Sink the putt."
"Make the shot."
"Nothing but net."
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
-- It's for you, Ike.
Look, he's running after her.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
You're coming here?
Then come for dinner.
Of course we are.  Of course.
Then you'll be my best man.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
Get this man a Kamikaze.
Thanks.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
I don't think that's why she ran.
Unbelievable, she got to you.
Sorry, no.  I just got one.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
About her upcoming wedding and all.
I am just such a reporter.  And you are?
And you are?
Looking for Maggie.
I think you'd look good in red.
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
Your two cinnamon rolls.
Thank you.
They made me put my hat back on.
Originality is my speciality.
You're going to be very disappointed.
Everest.  Is that right?
Twice...
Really?
How romantic.
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
Too much.
Seven-fifty.
Five hundred.
Six-fifty.
Maybe someday.
You afraid to try?
Always a mood killer.
I'm a work in progress.
I don't know.
You don't know.
You look... uh... You look fine.
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
Kind of isolated.
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
It's fun!  It's high.
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
That was very interesting research George was doing!
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
About a minute...?
A little longer for me.
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
I love you.  I love you.
Yes, you!
Well, you do have the dress.
I'm okay with that.
So am I.
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
Reporter?
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
I'm going to kill myself.
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
Lighten up, wahine.
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
You okay?  I'm closing.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
Good boy, Port Hole.
I'm really rooting for this one.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
No.  It's my life.
You tell Maggie.
No, you tell her.
Is there somebody else?
He's got a houseboat.
I hate boats.
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
Am I what they had in mind?
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
Nope.
Even when you were young?
Happy New Year, darling.
Walter, I'd love to --
Go for a walk in Central Park --
What is it?
It's delicious, trust me.
Does it have wheat in it?
When you get back, I'll be gone --
What?
About forever.
I do.
Walter.
Beautiful view, isn't it?
-- it was a betrayal.
So what happened?
I told you.  Nothing --
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
Oh!
What?
You should write something about this.
About what?
What was that about up there?
What was what?
What's with you?
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
Can too.
No.
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
Men never get this movie.
Hello.
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
Did you talk to him?
Becky?
What?
Is this crazy?
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
Thank you.  I love you.
I love you, too.
I love that dream.
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
But he saw you, right?
Becky?
No, I'm not. 
What are your plans in New York?
Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
Maybe you should see a shrink.
I want my money.
Are you Annie?
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
Howard.
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
It's probably just the flowers --
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
What?
You know.
What?
Magic.  It was magic.
It's a sign.
Sure you do.
Magic.
Hello.
It's you.
Which means --
Grace heard it.
Who is this?
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
What was it that made you know?
It's not that late in Seattle.
You don't like the one he was now?
Where's your mom?
No.
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
It is not --
You'll find out.
What is it?
Dad, could you close the door?
You think so?
It's Y. O. H.
Yeah.  What's that?
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
Do you want a fruit plate?
Dad --
It's a spice rack.
Dad?  About last night?
It's never happening again. Right?
It plays in 50 states.
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
Dad, I don't know about this one --
Oh, you're changing your mind --
P.  Dad?
Fine.  Fine.
So I can go.
Sure.  Looking good.
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
I'm sorry.  I'm just --
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
It doesn't.  They ask you.
What do you think?
Whose show was this on?
Jed's got cables.
Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.
I know.
It was sinking.
Bye bye blackbird.
I don't know.
This one's for both of us.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
Listen to this --
It's a sign.
Why is she bringing that bag?
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
It's only ten o'clock.
Okay.
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
Don't ever do that again.
What are you doing up?
I was thirsty.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
No.
Everyone at work heard you.
I just called for a second.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
God, she's beautiful.
Who is Annie?
Have you seen my wallet?
Are you going with her?
Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
What's wrong with Annie?
This conversation is finished.
Did not.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
Get out.
What if I couldn't get to you?
If I didn't go.
I can't believe you flew first class.
What about camping?
What about it?
Hi.
Hi.  Sam?
Yes?
It's a little derivative.
Hi.
You look good.
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
He's ten.
He's good at it.
I read an article about this ...
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?
You're welcome to one.
Mornin'.
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
You haven't tried locking them up!
Got any more ideas?
Take a drink. Calm down!
Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
How goes it?
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
Who? A scab?
Are you sick, Mama?
Mama, can I put the candles ...
Why are they singing, Mama?
They are singing for me.
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.
But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen
Where you going?
This water's cold again.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
Never... never... never!
I'm a fool.
Was it expensive, the beer?
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
What's the matter?
Mother of God ...have mercy ...
A fighter, huh?
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
What were they saying? About you? In there?
Let them take it!
Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes.
She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
Can be what?
You all right?
How do you feel?
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
Four nights. How did you sleep?
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
We've got to have a talk, you and me.
Where are you going?
Hunting.
When?
Sun up.
Alone?
No.
Ramn -- you can't.
You mean Delaware?
Well, if that's possible ...
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?
I thought maybe you forgot...
Forgot what?
Lus! Come down here!
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
Ramn ... listen for the love of God ...
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
Ramn -- listen my kids ...
T! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
My kids don't have enough to eat!
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
That's it?
Are you Australian?
No.
Bobby?
What?
What can I do for you?
Not even a guess?
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
Did you see his hair color?
What is it?
Ride 'em cowboy)
Who wouldn't?
First rate, ain't it?
Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.
Yeah.
Everything go?
I ain't a idiot, asshole.
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
What about the guy on the very bottom?
Leave me out of this.
This man sounds like a real catch.
What?
Nothing.
Then leave.
I can't.
I can't leave.
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
Oh. Hi.
Don't worry. He's out of town.
How far out of town?
Miles Davis. "All Blues."
And you admire that?
Is that how you play?
What do you want from me, Colette?
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
It gets me through the day.
This has nothing to do with him.
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
How much time do you have?
What is wrong with you?
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
You don't like the tune, find another station.
What are you hiding, Danny?
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
Who is it?
I need my paycheck.
You can still work.
Ass first into the world.
Why not?
What's wrong, Danny?
You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
Colette, go.
I don't want to leave you.
Oh shit
How the hell did we get this detail?
What time is it?
Twelve
Where to?
I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
Why's that?
My features. They're Finnish.
You don't say.
I'm hurting.
You remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up?
Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
A quarter?  Danny that ain't even worth ...
Fuuuuuck
Can you set that up?
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
You wanna score some go-fast?
Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
I think on account of his nose.
You're going to have to explain that one.
You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?
You want a hit?
Can I ask you something?
What does J.F.K. stand for?
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Was he the president?
Danny?
But...I've seen you.
When? When did you ever see me use?
But... why? Why would you pretend?
I can't tell you.
You don't trust me?
You don't understand.
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
Crank or glass?
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?
Not bad.
Can we talk price?
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
You're serious?
Anything for a dear friend.
So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
You want to do this some other time?
Pull your pants down.
I'm sorry?
Come on, guys ...
Shoot him.
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
What the hell is this?
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
Cool it. We got business.
You got a name?
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Danny, I'm touched.
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
I was getting to it.
What the hell are you doing here?
Question is, what are you doing here?
I was trying to score some dope.
This chink have a name?
You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.
You've got no choice.
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
Bullshit. He's a liar.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
That's because he doesn't have one.
What? Is it bad?
I'm afraid so, Danny.
That's real sweet, Garcetti.  Thanks.
Jesus.
I thought you'd be happy.
Danny?
Whatever you say, man.  Look ... can we talk about this?
This the guy?
That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
Yeah.  What about him?
Turns out he's connected.
To who?
He knows somebody ratted him.
We know what's going on.
Jimmy?
Who the hell is Jimmy?
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
What's that smell?
That would be me.
Excuse me?
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?
Again, I thank you.
And you've got wiener breath.
Tom, let's spend the night here.
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
You think that's a good idea?
What do you mean?
First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?
Just no pleasing you, is there?
My sentiments exactly.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
Where's Bubba?
What is it, drugs?
What is that? Rum and coke?
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
Find a chaplain.
Casualties?
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
Yes, sir.
You writin' a book or somethin'?
The Army gave you that?
You must be a hell a shot.
That must be four thousand yards.
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
So, that's Ryan.
Yes, sir.
What do you think?
He ain't half-bad, I guess.
He ain't Wade.
No kiddin'?
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.
In the shadow by those two trees.
Watching.
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
Not yet.
Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
It's worth it.
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...
But you could have gotten killed and I...
Pass.
It looks like a Renoir.
I heard.
You know classical music?
Some.
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
What is it?
That only leaves three.
I wonder where they're going.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
Sure, you got one?
Captain, what about our deal?
Worked, didn't it?
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
What about the company?
Beasley's dead.
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
Fresh out.
You get a translator, Captain?
Hell of a mission.
Uh, Captain...
PUSH!
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
Nope.
You're kidding yourself.
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
How about I go right, sir?
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
You alright?
I think you're right, Keith.
Uh, oh.
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
Trust me, you're the best.
There's always a bright side.
I'm listening, sir.
General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.
No, sir.
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.
HERE THEY COME!
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
What deal?
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
Here they come.
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans.
Yes, sir.
You set?  Sarge nods.
FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
Frogs?
Lingerie.
Damn fool.  Sir.
Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
You think he really believed it?
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
Because he's guilty.
Understanding the following rights...
Speak with my lawyer.
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
For going to school?
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Good for her.
I'll take the whole set.
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
Keep it.
Lloyd?
I hope you understand.
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
Yeah.
You're tough, J-man.
I'll be in my office.
No, no, don't go in there.
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
That's not even a scam.
What's a scam?
Then what's love?
Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.
Lloyd.
C'mon, just do it.
C'mon Lloyd.
Please?
That's just so embarrassing.
Hang in there, man.
Yes.
See you tomorrow.
What does it say?
No, you're not a guy.
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
I don't feel anything.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
He'd like to start serving immediately.
I can put that together.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
Lloyd, she's being difficult.
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
You like it?
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
I'm sorry.
I love you dad.
I just had a phone call.
Tell me, is it bad news?
No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Which they did.  Let me finish.
Morning.
You should be.
Bon voyage.
Do you love him?
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.
Honey!
Swear to god.
I swear to god.
But I found the money.
Honey, it's not what you think.
What am I supposed to think?
No, but you stole from them.
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
Alright.
Thank-you.  The real world.
Thank you very much.
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Yeah.  What a day.
Yeah.
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Are you busy on Friday?
I'll go.
Pardon me?
Eight. Eight O' clock.
Goodbye.
What are these?
So it's an honor?
So we can finally talk?
He does this every year?
Have a good sleep.
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
That's cool then.
Twisted?
You know what?
So what's your job this summer?
Job?  Being a great date.
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Then call me tomorrow.
Today is tomorrow.
Nice one.
I think you should wear that.
You think so?
Me?  Sure I do.
Stop by later.
Okay, bye.
You have to meet Bess.
Yes.
What did you say?
I just can't have any social life right now.
Be friends?
Yeah.  With potential.
Okay, this is important...
Are you comfortable?
Yes.  Are you shaking?
No.
You're shaking.
I don't think so.
You're cold.
I don't think I am.
Then why are you shaking?
Your letter came yesterday.
It did?
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
Why didn't you tell me?
No, we don't have to say it.
How do you know what I'm going to say?
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
Well, I need to study, and...
You need to study?
We'll see.
Okay, what did we just decide?
No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
No, I don't, I don't.
You shared it with a dick.
No.
Did you talk to Corey?
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
Did you tell anybody?
Just my dad.
Then don't do it.
What do you want?
I'm sorry.
Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
I love you.
One more time would be nice.
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
You're freaking out here man.
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
Uh... okay... um...
No.
The guy with the Datsun?
No.
She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
Fine Lloyd.
How ya doing?  Is she around?
Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?
Seriously, Lloyd.
I'm totally and completely serious.
Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...
I know.
She's very successful.
I know
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
My car.
Diane Court.
Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
Oh boy.
Hey.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
Ooop, excuse me.
Oh, I was just going to...
I was gonna...
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
I love you man
I love you man.
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
We're full on bonded.
Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
What's your name?
You know what, you'd like her.
Oskar, please -
Luck.
Should I stay?
Should I stay?
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
All right, okay, let's talk.
We started without you.
They're not gone, they're here.
Scherner told me something else about you.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
When?
You want these people.
Look -
I just told you.
So I'm responsible for the weather?
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
This is not my problem.
What do I got for you?
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
That's great, thanks.
God bless you, sir.
Yeah, okay.
Like this?
How you feeling, all right?
Good.  How's it going?
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
Thank you.
I need a drink.
We're losing the war, aren't we.
Pots and pans.
Yes.
Better this month than last?
Christmas presents.
What other point is -
I'll talk to him.
That's very generous of you.
We need to talk.
They arrived.
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.
I'll talk to you later.
I didn't do enough.
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
Have you checked the...
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
He's broken his pattern.
They've broken their pattern.
I won't.
Don't. Think Bailey.
Shit.
What is it?
I heard a noise.
Outside.
Don't do that. Hang up...call...
What? I can't hear you...
I'm losing you.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Who is this?
Cici. Who's this?
Someone who wants to talk to you.
What if I said you?
What if I said goodbye?
Why would you wanna do that?
I thought you were going to the mixer?
I had to change. Did anyone call?
Cotton.
Can we talk?
You could start with an apology.
Did it?
Its over, Cotton.
Look, I'm sorry about the face.
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
And much richer as a result.
Do I know you? You look familiar.
Tons and tons.
Where is Sidney's father?
Home--where he lives.
And are the police sure about that?
Why don't you ask them?
What are you going to do?
Finish what my son started.
My documentary is due on Tuesday.
What's your subject?
Not one bit.
Where's Sid?
She dumped me.
No way.
Yeah.
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
About what?
This is exactly what I don't want.
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
Go on, untie him.
No. This is a set up.
Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
Two.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
She's got guards with her.
What guy?
He seemed harmless.
Need some help, honey.
I really dont like that comparison, honey.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
So we found a compromise.
We had to have financing.
Hello, Dwight.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
I see you read the book.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
You have every right to be upset.
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
I know that.
Not good. How you doin?
What are we looking for?
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
Can we turn the light on?
And it's sexier in the dark.
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
..and as lonely as I am...
And Joel's pre-med.
Ssshh! What was that?
This is all too familiar.
Jesus Christ!
Let's go.
Dewey?
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
Who is this?
That's not the way we play the game.
I don't play games.
Where are you?
Oh--a God complex
What do you want from me?
No, wait...
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
What?
Are you in danger now?
Where is your attacker?
Lucas and his Romper Room stage.
I have rehearsal.
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
He tried to kill her first.
You're going to get it. You know what happens.
Knock yourself out.
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
What about rehearsal?
That was good.
Who is that guy?
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
How many guys they have on you?
I've been waiting for you, baby.
And white.
You're not allowed to ask that.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
..it's really about family and tradition...
Hello?
Gale?
She's not here right now.
I hate scary movies.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
Take it off.
But...
Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?
I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.
Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.
I'll be right back.
What was that?
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
Jesus.  Hello?
Hello.
Who is this?
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
Asshole, Can't talk.
Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
More of a game really.
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
What?!
You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?
Where are you?
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
It may be Maureen Reynolds --
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
Please, call me Gale.
Are you sure?
What do you know about trilogies?
You mean like, movie trilogies?
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
To me Hollywood is about death.
Oh yeah, how?
What does this have to do with Sid?
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Is that a threat, Detective?
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
Detective Kincaid?
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
The killer called her.
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
I can see nothing's changed.
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Where's Gale?
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
Off the record.
I'm sorry, this is too good!
You're not a detective.
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Gale, your engine's still running.
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
OH. OH GOD. GALE --
What?
Thank you.
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
Sidney, what happened?
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
Who's phone?
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
What the hell are you doing?
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
Need to get in that building?
No really?
Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
Nobody said she was an actor.
Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Just because you knew her?
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.
Gale he's got Dewey!
I know! He killed Kincaid!
I know!
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.
Huh, fine.
Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
Hello.
Who's this?
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
But you know my favorite name?
I'm hanging up right now.
What?  What movie?
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
No I need to call you. Just you.
What? She asked.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
I didn't kill anybody.
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
You ready to party hard tonight?
Dude. What are you doing here?
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
Ready?
It's on the table.
I thought she was dead.
She can't get both of us.
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
You rode your bike out there?
Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
Billy? What the...
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
My dad's in the other room.
Close call.
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
Jesus, SHIT!
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
It's been a year since she died.
Sshh... it's okay.
Or even a good porno.
You heard me.
Are you serious?
Who did you call?
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
I thought you were...
NO! Don't believe him.
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.
Yes.
Who are you trying to reach?
What number is this?
What number are you trying to reach?
I don't know.
Do I?
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
To apologize.
You're forgiven. Bye now.
I want to talk to you for a second.
I don't think so.
Popcorn.
You're making popcorn?
I only eat popcorn at the movies.
Just some scary movie.
Do you like scary movies?
Uh-huh.
I don't know.
Guess.
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
So, you gotta boyfriend?
Why? You wanna ask me out?
Why do you want to know my name?
I want to now who I'm talking to.
That's not what you said.
I have to go now.
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Nah, I don't think so...
Don't hang up on me.
What do you want?
To talk.
Dial someone else, okay?
You getting scared?
Is this some kind of a joke?
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
What do you want?
I believe you...
So you better leave.
Where are you?
That all depends on you.
I wanna play a game.
No...
NOOO!
What kind of game?
Please don't do this...
Come on. It'll be fun.
No... please.
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Don't do this. I can't...
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
I don't know...
Come on, yes you do.
What's his name?
Michael... Michael Myers.
Now for the real question.
NOOOO....
Please go away! Leave us alone!
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
No it's not. It was Jason.
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
And why is that? Has something happened?
Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.
No, not yet.
He's not a suspect, is he?
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
Deputy... good evening.
What brings you out to these parts?
You never know when or where a story will break.
Then what are you doing here?
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
I'll call for backup.
What are you doing here?
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.
Did you reach my Dad?
You're sure it was the Hilton?
I don't know. I guess.
Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
You girls ready.
Have they found my father?
Afraid not.
Should I be worried?
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
I was first to respond.
Drive by patrol.
How is she?
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
You think he could still be in town?
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
That fish smelled strong.
Jesus...
What is it? Where's Casey?
Casey! Casey!
What? What?
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
What's the delay?
How's the book?
I'm not here to fight.
Just stay back.
I want to talk to you.
Off the record. No cameras.
Please. You owe me.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
Have you talked to Cotton?
Many times.
Why would she lie about it?
What's your favorite scary movie?
Are you alone in the house?
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
So where are you?
So where are you?
Can you see me right now?
Uh-huh.
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
Hello?
Can you knock?
I heard screaming.
...out at the airport...
...so call if you need me.
Have a good trip.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Working, thank you.
Stop. Right there.
For about two seconds.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
Besides --  "Takes a man to do something like that."
Jesus, this place is packed.
So what's his reason?
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
And what would be your motive?
I thought everything was checked out.
What's Leatherface doing here?
He came to make up.
There goes my chance with Sid.
Wanna another beer?
Yeah.
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
Why are they doing this?
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
Why are you doing this?
You're crazy -- both of you.
The official term is "psychotic".
Do you believe this shit?
Or a man's mentality.
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Thanks, Tatum.
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
Whatever. Just hurry.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
Just like old times, ain't it?
Do you really think Billy did it?
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
Shit, what is he doing here?
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
I don't know...
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
I thought you dumped her for me.
What am I? The beer wench?
That's not necessary.  You're in.
You don't.  It goes to court now.
He's pissing in our faces again and we're just taking it.
What do you think?
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
So what?  This victim...
What's this: "I'm declining this case?"  It don't work that way.
Have you heard?
No, I haven't heard.
It's none of my business anymore.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
Yeah.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
What are you talking about?
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
He's being arraigned tomorrow.
Where was the girl?
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
What the hell's going on?
Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
I don't believe it.
What's so exciting?
What time is it?
Give me the gun.
You didn't know.
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
Murderers?
A woman...
You should be thanking me.
Just keep leading the way.
Here he comes.
You just met me.
Not here.
Drop it.
Who said this was murder?
There's a bucket here.
It's a bucket of vomit.
Is there any blood in it?
You think it was poison?
This is his stuff.  I've been out in the cold all day.
It's too soon for him.
How's that?
What about sports?
You go to movies at least?
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?"  This is sick.  "The Honeymooners?!"
He must have left another puzzle piece.
And, if it's a threat.
He's preaching.
Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
No fingerprints?
Nothing.
This is the one thing.
Nothing.
What the fuck is that?
There must be something.
What?
And you don't?
I wish I still thought like you.
Does this make it with you?
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
Why would we?
It is Victor.
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
Sorry about that... I just...
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
We don't know for sure...
How much money do you have?
How do you know all about this?
This is a waste of time.
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
Modern Homicide Investigation.  In Cold Blood.  Of Human Bondage.  Human Bondage?
It's not what you think it is.
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
You're sure you're reading that right? John Doe?
That's what it says.  Jonathan Doe.
This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.
You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
Are you alright?
I'm fine.
It was him.
We need a warrant.
Think about it...
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You stupid son of a...
What are you talking about?
We could use about fifty more men here.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
You do your job...
You knew I'd say yes.
Because he is John Doe, by choice.
Kiss me on the lips.
Stay with him.
Throw your gun down now!
Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!
Tell me it's not true.
Don't do this... please...
Anything... anything missing or different.
I don't see anything.
Are you absolutely certain?
This painting...
Don't worry.  I don't wear it at the dinner table.
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.
How long have you lived here?
It's a hard place.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
You should look into private schools.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
Did their son see it happen?
How's California?
How should I know?
It was Ethan found you squallin' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred...
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
Let's get along...
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.
No sir...pleasure.
You all right, sergeant?
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...
He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
You can forget that...  Wouldn't be legal anyway.
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
Got a warrant?
He cometh forth like a...
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
What good does that do?
You got any more orders, Captain?
If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!
What in...?
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
No Debbie! That ain't what happened! They been lyin' to you...
Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.
Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.
Scar! Where's he holed in?
How'd you come by this?
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
That's what I said.
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...
What you want me to call you?
Nothing for you to see.
You all right, Ethan?
What you goin' to do?
Good night...Laurie...
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...
Futterman?
He just couldn't wait...
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
Think she means for us to follow?
Ethan, quit it!
Nine...  Ten!
Well, you're a widower now...
No...She's not...
Why didn't he make his move back there?
How? She's even forgot her own language!
They'll be back...
What's that got to do with us?
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
Not far from it...
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
I got your boy killed.
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
She's not a little girl any more.
You've seen her!...She's alive?
The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?
Don't go takin' that stuff...
You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
Finish your breakfast...
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
Martie...don't go! Not this time.
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
She'd be about thirteen now...
Why else?
Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?
I have to cut his windpipe...
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
Ellen, move aside...
Stop that!
Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences.  You know how it is with women.
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
It still worked in town.
Hey... the fuse.
Do you know where fuse box is?
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
Do you have a better idea?
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
What are you doing?
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?
Cherry-red Tears.
I miss Tommi so much.
Who was that?
So, did you sleep good?
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.
Where have you been?
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
What? What am I supposed to sense?
Who's that?
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
It's important - he knows the last chapter.
Frank Kosinski.  Here's the address.  Go see him.  Ask him.
Hello.  Can I help you?
It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
Do I look like it that much?
Mrs. Straub!
I've killed my husband!
Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.
You didn't tell her!
Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
Well, look here!
Tenth floor.
NedI knowI know
It's good.
Oh
The title won't do.
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
You are a gentleman.
Follow that boat!
Do you know that house?
What do you want, Kit?
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
You have the last act?
You have the money?
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
Wait!  Will you desist!
We have no Juliet!
We will all be put in the clink.
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
What is the chief part?
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
The title?
It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
How much?
Ten pounds.
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
Interesting.
Nothing comes.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
How long has it been?
A goodly length in times past, but lately
And your relations?
On my mother's side the Ardens
So now you are free to love
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
I have a wonderful new play!
Put his feet in.
Cut his nose off.
What's the title?
A share of the profits.
There's never any
Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's DaughterAlmost finished?
This time we take your boots off!
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
So what do we do?
Where is the play?
Is it going well?
But nothing is happening.
No Juliet?!
it will be all right, madam.
What happened to Sam?
Who are you?
Do you know it?
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
It is all locked safe in here
God be praised!  Locked?
Who is she this time?!
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
Where are you going?
Now where? Will?
I feel a scene coming on.
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
What? Who?
We are lost.
No, it will turn out well.
How will it?
Another little problem.
What do we do now?
The show must  you know
How will it?
Kit
How goes it, Will?
Wonderful, wonderful.
Burbage says you have a play.
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
Good title.
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
Romeo isItalian. Always in and out of love.
Ethel.
Do you think?
The daughter of his enemy.
Good luck with yours, Kit.
I thought your play was for Burbage.
This is a different one.
"Good morrow, cousin."
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
"Out."
Two hours at prayer!
Not ready? Where is she?
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
Be good to her, my lord!
When the Queen commands it.
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
What do you love so much?
And I love poetry above all.
When will you write me a sonnet, Will?
Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
I am, Master Shakespeare.
Master Shakespeare
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
"Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
"Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd."
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
"Ay me."
"O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
Like you, I found him not at home!
You have opened the playhouses?
I have, Master Shakespeare.
Who are you, master?
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
My lady!
Who is there?
Anon, good nurse. Anon.  Master Shakespeare?!
The same, alas.
Oh but why "alas?"
Oh my lady, my love!
If they find you here they will kill you.
Can you love a fool?
I do not know how to undress a man.
There is.
Even your play.
And that was only my first try.
No, the morning rooster woke me.
Oh, let Henslowe wait.
Let him be damned for his pages!
There is time. It is still dark.
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
Oh, do not go
Oh, Will!
That's my line!
You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
Then I will go with you.
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
Will! What--?
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love.
An excellent beginning  Let him bea duke. And your heroine?
How does it?
My lady Viola.
My lord.
I have spoken with your father.
My lady VIOLA.
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
But why me?
Will you defy your father and your Queen?
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
I am going to church.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
Take off your hat.
I . . .
Wait there.
Do you understand me?
I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen Act Two.
If you love her, you must do what she asks.
And break her heart and mine?
It is only ours you can know.
She loves me, Thomas!
But what of Lord Wessex?
Here we come at last, my lord!
Is there a man?
You are on my ground.
What's his name?
All right, just a few questions.
I was trying to educate you.
Just serve.
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
Will you shut up and play.
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
What do you think?
About what?
About this guy, this Hugo person.
He made it clear.
Have you seen him?
Alex, I don't have the time --
No.
Think about it.
No.
Come on, David.
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
He's still here.
He couldn't get his car started.
When are you going to let the police know?
You call them if you want.
So who's going to do it?
Dig the pit, I don't know.
No, not that.
Then what? Who's going to do what?
You know what I'm talking about.
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
I can't do it.
I don't hear this.
I just thought we should discuss it.
Finished.
But not quite.
Is this necessary?
That was good.
Can we talk about something?
What's the problem?
Now.
How much did you pay?
How much did you pay?
I don't know.
How much?
What is this?
Security.
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
There was a break-in.
I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
What? Yes, that's fine.
You're sure? There's lots more.
What's wrong?
You're not eating.
Not eating like you used to, that's what.
You looking for me?
Who?
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
Where do you think you'll go?
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
Well?
I don't know.
Is this being recorded?
This is just an informal discussion.
What does it look like?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
No. Why should it?
I've never seen any of these men before.
Take another look at these two.
Well, is it?
What?
That's it, then.
That's all?
Sorry to waste your time.
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Just one thing.
That's right.
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
Yes, thanks.
Yes.
And you like it?
Cameron.
Yes.
Did you know --
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
She hated you --
I'm not usually drunk.
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
-- instead of what he is --
What I am.
-- which is --
Know and love?
Yeah.
I think you're lying.
Have you seen Hugo?
David hasn't seen him either.
So I gathered.
Maybe he didn't like us.
David?
Hugo.
He's got a car?
So what's wrong with that?
What sort of car?
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
So?
Yes.
Now?
Yes.
I wonder how he did it?
Alex.
What? What's wrong?
What are you doing?
I'm just looking.
Don't.
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
No, Alex. It's, it's --
What?
Unfeasible.
Who's going to do it?
I thought we all were.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
I don't want to. It's different.
OK.
Love and happiness for ever.
David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
No, I don't.
What's he doing here?
Hello. Hello.
Are you all right?
No.
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
You know we're right.
Leave him alone.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
Boy, am I glad to see you.
What are you doing here?
We have to talk.
Later. But first -- him.
David?
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
And the money?
We could put it somewhere.
Where he can't get it?
Now you thought of that, not me.
Expecting anyone?
No.
It's the only way.
I refuse.
You'll wait in the hall?
Alex.
Are you all right?
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
It's about me and David.
The perfect couple, I should say.
Don't you ever stop?
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
So, uh...
What?
It's OK. There's no problem.
You mean I can have the room?
What about?
Burglary?
Downstairs.
Of course.
did you hear anything before he cries?
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
Two?
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
No, I've never seen them.
You're sure of that.
Yes.
Why do you want a room here?
Just get on with it, Alex.
I've never seen a dead body before.
Are you all right?
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
Two hundred.
Two hundred pounds?
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
Expecting anyone?
What?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
No one. I promise.
Who have you talked to?
No one.
I thought you'd gone to work.
I'm sorry.
We already know. All about it.
So let's go.
Yes.
Here.
In this firm.
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
Eh --
I'm boring?
You get the job done.
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
What happened to that guy?
What guy?
What guy that died?
That one, last week.
Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
Oh, him. Well, he died.
You must be Hugo.
Would you like to come in?
What's it about?
A priest who dies.
I see.
Writing seems easy.
Do you think you could answer that?
No.
It was some guy called Brian.
Did he sound upset?
Working nights?
I'm a doctor.
And he's a patient of yours?
No. But he needs treatment.
For what?
The human condition.
I write about it?
Take all the time you like, doctor.
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
I suppose so.
Offering it for debate.
You can tell by the intonation.
Your watch.
Is it real?
You're in a good mood today, George.
Chicken salad.
Anyway, you remember Harold?
Don't you think there's too much gold?
I don't know, I think...
Don't you like her?
Then what's the problem?
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
Who?
Maybe... why do you ask?
Yes, but... I thought...
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
What do you expect me to do about it?
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
We cannot go into this later.
What are you talking about?
What're you looking for?
Thanks a lot.
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
She's got a...
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
Yeah, I think so.
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
I don't know.
Gee, that's very serious...
I know.
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
She did?
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
You're very rude... if you don't come back --
I'll be back in a while.
I don't want to see you anymore.
You're late, George.
I gotta talk to you.
I don't want to talk about it...
But you don't know what happened.
-- What?
Nummers.
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
I don't want to place you in any position --
-- to be put in that kind of position...
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
I can see that.
You're looking great, baby.
What're you doing later?
Why don't you see Lester?
Your husband?
Yes.
Is she all right?
-- Anyway.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
No, I know.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
Hi.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
But aren't you...
Well she...
She what?
She's a friend of Jill's.
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
Oh, no.
... what?...
That headboard.
You going to answer it?
Want me to?
You're rude. I mean, you're very rude.
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
Her?
Are you?
No.
Then it's not your problem.
No. You know too many sick ladies.
I guess so.
Okay.
Shit.
Hungry?
You're my mother's hairdresser?
I do her hair, yeah.
Chopped liver?
No thanks.
Did you hear me?
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
See if you've been making it with my mother.
Have you ever made it with a girl?
I asked you first.
Well, are you?
Am I what?
... just, you could look very heavy...
Don't make conversation with me.
I never get my hair done.
No shit.
No.
Then what do you think?
That you're just like your mother.
You are.
I am not!
I am not!
Right now?
Right.
How is she?
Great.
Right.
And you need money?
You do know what money's like these days.
What sort of references do you have?
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Pardon me?
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
George!
Yes, Buffums.
I've got heads here, Norman.
You promised you'd do the show.
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
So how's Norman?
Jesus...
I don't know. Probably not.
Jill's really great, isn't she?
I'm sure.
-- Well no. It never came up.
You going to tell him?
Where do you want to do this?
Probably the bathroom.
Well, what do you think?
You would?
You don't seem very sure.
Jill's coming with us.
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
Whew.
What's wrong?
Not too much, don't cut too much.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
No.
And?
And what?
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
George... how about Felicia?
What?
Did you?
Did I what?
You know what I'm talking about.
You did, I know you did.
One of my few virtues is discretion.
George...
Yeah, baby...
No! Don't! Please!
It'll ruin everything.
I know... you don't know, I know.
Sit down.
What are you talking about?
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...
-- this guy with Jill.
-- don't you want to --
-- you are.
I don't know what gets into me.
No you didn't.
You don't think so? I do.
That sounds like me.
He still having parties?
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
Am I entertaining you?
We're friends.
-- where'd you go?
-- oh I thought you were --
-- what?
-- very nice, very nice.
Mmmm --
-- ass and legs --
Look who's talking.
Me?
What's wrong?
-- we're kidding ourselves.
Why?
Where are you going?
Please, we'll have to talk later --
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
-- It's Malone's.
You're going to kill me.
So I'm saying it...
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know... Jackie?
What for?
No, man.
-- Right after I sprayed her?
Wanda...
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
Yeah!
Wash her.
-- White ladies?
Otis is dead.
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
-- please, please forgive me...
-- you know better...
-- why did you come in today?
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
-- how did you get here?
-- took a bus.
Jackie Shawn.
-- yeah, this is --
Not yet.
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.
That's too bad.
I have to see you.
Hi, George.
There were some shots.
What're you talking about?
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
Where?
Who?
I just... who what?
Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.
George --
Keep moving --
Now, George --
How are you, baby?
Fine. How are you?
What about me?
You're different.
I am?
You're great.
Yeah.
Do you really mean that?
Honey?
Yeah, baby.
Will we live together?
Maybe you don't even like children.
Of course I like children.
You've never even been around one.
Yeah.
Okay...  Night, baby.
George?
Jill, say hello to Felicia.
Hey, I'm, you know --
Go where?
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
I already said hello.
Okay.
George.
Yeah, baby.
When can I talk to you?
About what?
Whether or not I'm going.
Going where?
Honey, have they offered you the job?
No, but I think they might.
What do you want?
They didn't offer you the job yet.
I want your feelings about it.
When I get off work.
When is that?
I'll call you.
When is that, George?
What?
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
Jill says nothing.
Where's your car?
A friend dropped me off.
Who?
Never mind. Where've you been?
What business meeting?
What does he direct besides traffic?
Ha, ha.
Television or movies?
Now, Jackie --
-- go ahead.
-- well aren't you --
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
Bullshit.
How come you took your own car?
I didn't want him meeting me here.
You did fuck him, didn't you?
Didn't you, baby?
That was him.
-- and take this with you.
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
How many?
What do you wanna know for?
Baby, don't do this --
-- please, baby --
-- no, it'll help me, really --
What? What? What? What? What?
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
Please!... that's not like you.
Yeah, I know. Did you?
George, now cut this out.
Did you?
Stop it.
Did you?
Yes, yes, I did.
What did you say?
George...
What did you say?
What're you here for?
-- A wash and set.
No.
No?
You need a cut.
But Mr. Norman said --
Well, yeah.
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
It's an unusual trade.
In a way. But...
When?
... she's very upset...
You look like you've had quite a work-out.
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
I know it, I know it.
I don't know what to...
Well anyway...
You live like a pig.
All night.
Well... who are those guys?
What do they look like?...
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Well, what?
Godammit, George...
Now wait a minute...
Sit down.
But...
I wanna hear about it.
I wanna hear about it.
Was it me, did you have something against me?
What, do you think I planned it?
Did they have something against me?
Didn't they tell you?
Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
Want a drink?
No thanks.
I know.
Who?
What about Jackie?
What about her?
I mean, how did that happen?
She's nothing but a whore.
You really think so?
What took you so long?
I... uh... I... uh... can't.
No.

No.
Awww --
I'll call you back.
I'll call you back...

You're home.
Yeah.
I'm coming over.
I'll call you back.
No you won't.
Okay.

A soap?
A daytime soap opera.
And?
I was too old.
What was it, somebody's daughter?
Well maybe I can get you something.
You do?
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
George is going to open a shop.
I am?
Who do you think I was talking to?
Of course not.
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
What's that?
Shut the door, shut the door!
They get hair all over the place.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Does she know about us?
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
Hi, doll, what's wrong?
Jackie Shawn.
Hi, Leonard.
Poster-Kleiser.
That's right.
I'll call you.
See you later.
I am? I mean why?
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
Well, he is.
So what's your point?
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
You're really a love -- you sure?
-- No. No really.
Well, what is it, honey?
Nothing.
It must be something.
We don't think marriage is important.
But you have problems?
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
How much?
Jackie --
I would say so, yes.
Honey?
Didn't you have any panties on?
-- He reached up and tore them.
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
Egypt?
That's right.
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
Oh. thank you.
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
Well he's not exactly a friend.
Is he an enemy?
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
-- sort of a boyfriend?
I'm terribly sorry.
-- no.
Good for you.
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
George? Was he alone?
I don't think so.
That bastard.
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
Two weeks from tomorrow.
You're going?
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
-- what's the problem, honey?
-- I'll get in the back --
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
-- there's not much room --
-- yes, Jill.
Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
Thank you.
No... how long did you say?
No, it's not that...
No.
Are you married?
No!
We'll let you know tomorrow.
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
Have they sat down?
No of course not.
Call me Les.
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
Dad?
Yes?
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
You mean they ate each other up?
How's it going, Doc?
Are you having a good time?
I am, Dad.  Dad?
Yes.
No.  I'm just a little tired.
Yes?
Dad?
No, Dad.
Are you sure?
Yes, Dad.
You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?
Why don't you want to talk about it?
I'm not supposed to.
Tony.
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
I don't know.
Maybe he showed me something.
What about Room 237?
Room 237?
No I ain't.
Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's so pretty.
Mom?
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
Red Rum.
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Red Rum.
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
Mommy...
Danny, come here!
Mommy... Mommy...!
Mommy!
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
Talking to Tony.
Is Tony one of your animals?
No.
Because he hides.
Do I have to?
Please...
What sort of injury did he have?
Oh I wouldn't think of it.
Well how can I repay you?
Yes, sir.
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
No.
Who?
A nigger.
A nigger!
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
I'm a Wendy.
Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
No, we don't mind.
Good.
Pleased to meet you.
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
How's my credit in this joint anyway?
Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd.  Thanks.
Hi Lloyd.  I've been away.  Now I'm back.
It's good to see you.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
No charge?
Hi, babe.
Perfect for a child.
What time is it?
Any ideas yet?
What do you want me to do about it?
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
Did you find anything?
Yes, I did.
And you didn't see anything at all?
Somebody did that to him.
Get him out of here?
Jack!
I...
I can't really remember.
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
As soon as possible.
Of course I am.
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
Stay away from me!
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!
Stay away from me,
Wendy!
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay away from me!  Please...
Stop swinging the bat.
Stay away from me.
Stop it!
Wendy give me the bat.
Stay... stay away!
Stay away from me.
Jack, stay away from me!
Stop swinging the bat.
Give me the bat.
Wendy...
Go away.
Give me the bat.
Go away.
I'll bring back a doctor.
Wendy...
I'm gonna go now.
Mr. Ullman?
Yes?
I'm Jack Torrance.
Very nice to meet you.
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
five months of peace is just what I want.
can of itself be a problem.
They'll love it.
I don't believe they did.
shut in together over long periods of time.
Good morning Jack.  I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
No, my son's discovered the games room.
Royalty?
Thanks.
Hi.
Hi.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
Fine.
What time does the plane leave?
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
Lowe's car-?
Blue. This blue.
Can I tell you kids something?
Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
Yes. Go away.
Went shopping. Why?
Please, Uncle Al.
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
For getting a divorce?
There's something else scary.
I've been hearing noises in there.
What kind of noises?
Rattling. Rustling.
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
You all right, Marty?
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
You got a pilot's license, Marty?
Sure.
Yeah... sure.
What is it?
A tracer. You'll like it.
Was it a prescription?
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
I told you!
There! You see!
Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
You're not going to let it go, are you?
I saw what I saw.
What about crack?  You a user?
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
What you say?
BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
I think I hear it!
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
You know, I just might!
LET THY SPIRIT
You know what we're saying!
LET THY SPIRIT
He's... dreamy.  He's...
Yes, Mary?
SING!
Were you tempted?
SING!
And I'm tearful!
Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here?  At Sunday School?
And you listen to that?
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
How are you doing.
What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
His ashes?
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
What?
Okay, Christy -- strip.
What did who say?
You are so damn sexy.
No... it's fine.
Yes?
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
Oh, girls.
Yes, Betty?
This prom is a real drag.
Oh-huh.
Oh my! 
Yes, Betty?
Where did that come from?
Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
Just about.  Show me again.
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
That machine.
I know.  It's ancient.
What is it, Mary?
Hurry, Sister!
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
It's true -- I know her.
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
Pay attention...
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Shirelles.
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
It'll be hell.
Hopeless I
Amateurs 2
Babies
She's a pro.
Van Cartier.
JUST SING!
Come on, we're late.
What?  What time is it?
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
What?
Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
Three years.  A rookie.
Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
Mary Clarence!
Experience!  Right?
I have to do this.  So I can become a nun.
I'm getting experience.
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
Mary Clarence!
Goddamn it!
Oh my Lord!
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
I don't want to mess anyone up...
WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART
Are you leaving us?
The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words?
Wait, this isn't the way.  Who are you?
Run!  Take off!
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
Mary Clarence!
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
Your name?
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
St. Anne's?
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
You were unhappy?
Sit down.
Miss Van Cartier.
What? 
It has come to pass.
Are you talking about me?
And all those like you.
But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
No problem.
And the vow of chastity.
Silence?  No talking?  All day?
No food?
Is this all the food I get?
My what?
You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
And whom would you call?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
I got it.
I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
No.  No.
Out of the question.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
You sent for me?
But...
Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
Oh?
I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
He didn't do you a favor.
And if I don't?
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
Okay -- no limo.
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
Really?  Lieutenant?
You mean -- worried about my testimony?
Me too.
Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
Vince knows you're here.
I can't go with you.
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
I think they'd understand.
What're you doing?
Hey, girls.
Really.
Then one day they find you.
You won't even tell us?
But you didn't tell me!
A nun?
And if she runs?
He's so damn cocky.  This is different.
It's done?
Not... totally.
Well?
Right.
Get her!
There she is!
I can't see anything in here!
Joey?
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
You didn't shoot!
Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry?
What's she doing?
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
It should be here any minute.
We've got to save her!
Sister Mary Patrick?
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
Is this like your old convent?
He's not like other guys.
He's decent.
I'd rather sing than do anything!
It's better than ice cream.
But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.
Mary Clarence!  Sister!
We can't sing without her!  What should we do?
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
An... entertainer?
It's so beautiful...
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
Not a note.
She said they were from her old convent.
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
Reverend Mother?
And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
I lied.
I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
Hail, Constable.  How are you?
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
They spend two days in chains.
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
No bleeding.
We must be a curious sight to him.
He is a behemoth.
Bring Young Masbath here.
You need to sleep.
Bring him.
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
Stains of blood.
I will not allow it.  I will not!
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
Wallowing in sin and lust...
They need guidance.
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
Do you have these persons' wills?
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
Hmm?  See them?
Maybe you should take this.
Damn... damn... damn...
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
What is the common thread between these victims?
Where are we going?
Out there.  What do you see?
The Western Woods.
What kind of nuts?
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
Father said witches live there.
What is it?
Listen.
We are leaving.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
What is it?
We should go.
Man or woman?
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
Baltus Van Tassel.
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
I was getting worried.  Who was it?
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 
Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
Climb up!
Lady Van Tassel...
What can we do?
What now?
How are you?
Forgive me, I didn't know.
Other people?
Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
These scars.  How did you get them?
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
Thank you.  No.  Here...
I insist that you have it.
Why would you do such a thing?
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
And this gives worth to butchery?
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
To avenge his father, and the others.
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
She is not your birth mother, is she?
No, but... why do you ask that?
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
It is only me.
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
I apologize if I worried you.
Blood.
What are you doing?
The skull is gone.
What... what are you doing... ?
What is so urgent?
What did he say, Katrina?
What would you have me believe?
If you think I am behind this, say it.
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
Where are we going?
The church.
What was that?
Ichabod...
I... I can't do this.
Returning to the Western Woods?
Yes, actually.
No.  She has gone out.
It appears well.  It has already clotted.
Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
I know you saw me.
You cannot kill what is already dead.
There was not much blood, was there?
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
What did you say?
You are from the Hollow?
The Horseman.  Yes.
What... what are you doing?
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
Go home.
She did not do it... please listen...
She is guilty.
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
She has confessed.
I can go. You don't have to. You don't never go.
They say you're a whiz on fixin' lawn mowers and things.
I like them french-fried potaters.
Yeah, they's good all right.
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
Can I help you?
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
Well, what did you want?
You have any biscuits for sale?
Did you decide, sir?
What you got that's good to eat?
What do you like to eat here?
French-fried potaters.
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
About a half a mile I think it is.
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
You know what, by God?
How'd your baptizin' go?
He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.
Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!
Sure, I guess.
I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.
Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.
I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
What's all them books?
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.
What's you last name?
Childers.
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
Don't you live somewhere?
I did live there in the state hospital.
They let you out?
Yeah.
Are you well?
I reckon I feel all right.
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
You told me to come by.
Did you want to play ball with us?
Karl.  You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
Yeah, I did.
Who did you kill?
Two people.
Were they bad people?
I thought they was.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
Yeah.
That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
Hit was right thoughty of her.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
They ort to. You're a good boy.
What do you mean?
Pull on your works. Your privates.
Why not? It died?
Yeah.
It was alive?
A boy or girl?
It was still alive when you buried it?
You will? For sure?
No sir.
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
You don't want to give away all your books.
Yes sir.
I've got a feelin' today.
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
How come Karl won't eat here with us?
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
I know he does.
Mama?
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
You walk fast, don't you?
A blister shore can hurt.
I'm ye boy.
I ain't got no boy.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
You better go get your things.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
You better go get 'em.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
Karl, you up?
Yes sir.
Do they know about you?
My history.
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
You scared me.
I didn't aim to.
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
Ma'am?
It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
What's that you say?
Why are you here now?
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
So, you're really going to stay here?
That boy wants me to.
Did you knock on the door yet?
How long have you been standing here?
I done et just a little bit ago.
I reckon not.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
Do you smell shit?
Let's just go, Marsha.
No, we have to get this story.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
And what are you, his chaperone?
Will that be cash or charge?
So your mother grew up in Shanghai?
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
That's the subject of my last chapter.
Jesus, what happened to you?
I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
And what about for you?
Huh?
What about for you?
For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
Are you closed?
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
Looks like someone forgot a camera.
Yeah, I did.
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
I've never seen anything like it.
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
He's crazy.
No, he's not. You are.
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
Two, right?
Uh, better make it one.
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
So. Are we ready?
She probably died.
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
What do you mean?
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
And what's that supposed to mean?
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
Bully for you.
Why don't you open it and find out?
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
Five thousand bucks.
And you're giving it to me?
It's all yours, baby.
For keeps?
There's just one thing I want to know.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
And why the hell would you give me money?
How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
It'll never be finished.
Sure, Auggie, I got it.  The store's closed.  And when do I tell them it's open?
When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open!
Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
Is your name Paul Benjamin?
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
I just want to know where he is.
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
And you told your nephew about it?
You going to sit here all day?
I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis.
Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
Hi there, little brother.
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
Well?
Well what?
Aren't you going to say anything?
What do you want me to say?
Baby? And what baby is that?
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
So what's the time?
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
I owe you something.
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
East Seventy-fourth Street.
In Manhattan?
That's where the what comes in.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
Drawing's a good thing.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
What time is it?
Eight-thirty.
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
How long have you been here?
Are you going to be all right?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
Appreciation for what?
I don't know. For helping me out.
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.
What time did you get to bed last night?
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
I don't know.
Is it yours?
Yeah, it might be.
So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.
Yeah, I picked it up.
And started to run.
And started to run.
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?
How do you want that cooked?
Medium rare, please.
Fries?
Yes, please.
Lettuce and tomato?
Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?
Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
I don't know.
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
It is.
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
Question withdrawn, you may step down.
You're implying th...
The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
My mom.  Would be the problem.
I can just feel my spirits soar.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her.
Did you write that column?
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head.
Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
<u>Were</u> you, sir?  Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
As my wife testified, we were considering it.
I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it.
My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?
You have the night watch?  On the radio.
I did.  Boy.
Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
Here now, what are you fixin' to do?
You gonna climb that with one arm?
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.
That's when he fell.
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
We don't let go, you s...
You always run with the well open?
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
You gaff with the <u>hook</u> end. Blood's on the butt.  Where your hand goes.
You must think I like losing.
You want me to say that.
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.
Does it now?
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
I don't think so.
How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
Is it possible?
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
Are you absol...
He had no reason to.
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques...
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Are these your bags?
Yes.  And that one, too.
Okay, doll.
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
Wanna see my driver's license?
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
I beg your pardon.
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
Thank you ever so.
You're welcome.
Upsy-daisy.
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
Okay. 
- so the one-legged jockey said - 
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.
You're right, Joe.
No we're not.
Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?
Hey, Joe!
I told you - it's a sure thing.
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
I thought you weren't talking to me.
Yeah - where were you?
With you.
Nellie told us about it.
All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
I think they got me.
They got the bull-fiddle.
Where are we running, Joe?
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
My name is Josephine.
Not there - that's the emergency brake.
Now you've done it!
Done what?
Tore off one of my chests.
You'd better go fix it.
This way, Daphne.
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
Steady, boy.  Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
Good night, Daphne.
What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
What happened?
I got pinched in the elevator.
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
You know - the old shell game.
Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
And where's he going to be?
With ME?
That's right.
Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.
You can both go take a flying jump.
Come on, you can do better than that. Give him teeth - the whole personality.
Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
What are you doing with my flowers?
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
I'm engaged.
I am.
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
You think he's too old for me?
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
Jerry - there's another problem.
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
Like when?
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
That's some nerve!
Joe -
Shut up and keep packing.
Sugar?
Get me Room 414.
Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
What'll I tell him?
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
It's all fixed!  Osgood is meeting us on the pier -
OH!
Are my seams straight?
I'll say.
Good night, Sugar.
Good night, honey.
If there's anything I can do for you -
And that's one of them.
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
Stay as long as you'd like.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
Interesting.
Anything wrong?
That's ridiculous.
And your head is hot.
That's ridiculous.
And you've got cold feet.
What did you say?
I'm a very sick girl.
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
You all right?
How's the bottle?
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
What's the surprise?
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
We better have a drink first.
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
Who needs vermouth?
And bring the cocktail shaker.
See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?
What do you think you're doing?
You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.
I'm a what?
Well, I'll be - !   How about that guy?
We don't have to run.
I guess she's not in here.
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.
No!
How did you get that bracelet?
You like it?
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
Where did you girls play before?
How did those holes get there?
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
Yes.  For a whole year.
I was it.
It's about the Florida job.
What's wrong with us?
We could pass for that.
- you got to be blonde -
- and you got to be girls.
Just a moment, miss -  May I?
Help yourself.
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
Me too.  Bye now.
Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
Most of the time I slap it.
You must be quite a girl.
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
This is where I get off.
Please.  It won't happen again.
Who?
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
Daphne...
Yes, Osgood?
You're leading again.
Pleased to meet you.
Another bridesmaid?
I forgive you.
We'll adopt some.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?
To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
I don't like no witnesses.
We won't breathe a word.
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
Why?
And you'll be in all evening?
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
It's not the backs that worry me.
What kind of band is this, anyway?
No, we couldn't!
Well, here we are.
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
Where did he conduct?
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
I'm not very bright, I guess.
Rough?
I'll say.
Every time!
You know - I play tenor sax.
You're entitled.
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
What's happened?
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
Want to switch berths with me?
Would you mind terribly?
Thanks, honey.
Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
What makes you so sure?
Wait a minute, Daphne.  You haven't got a bathing suit.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
You're not hurt, are you?
I wish you'd make sure.
Thank you.
Who are you?
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Not very likely.
Are you staying at the hotel?
Not at all.
No, my flag steward.
Well, I'm not.
How's the stock market?
Could be.  Do you play the market?
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
- Inauguration balls -
- opening of the Opera -
- riding to hounds -
Well, I guess I'd better go -
It's been delightful meeting you both.
And you will come to hear us tonight?
The most wonderful thing happened -
What?
Guess!
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
I just got this motorboat - it's an experimental model.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.
It's all right for a bachelor.
What a beautiful fish.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
What is it?
I don't mind if I do.
Look at all that silverware.
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
What's on Thursdays?
It's the crews' night off.
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
They just sort of leave me cold.
Have you tried?
See?  Nothing.
Nothing at all?
Complete washout.
What happened?
I don't want to bore you.
What else is there for me? 
Is that anything?
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
Anything this time?
It's like smoking without inhaling.
I think you're on the right track.
Mineral baths - now really!
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.
Did you have a nice time?
Really?
From a rich millionaire.
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
Good evening, sir.
What'll it be, sir?
Who's going to raid a funeral?
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
We got different information.
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
What's his first name?  And where does he live?
Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
I cut myself shaving.
You shave with your spats on?
All right, Charlie - this the joint?
And who runs it?
I already told you.
Refresh my memory.
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
What for?
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
Perfect. All ginny.
Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--
I should get going.
Are you sure youre okay?
Hey.
You know what? Im not having this conversation right now.
If Ed ever found out....
Does Kat know?
Jeffrey told her last night.
Wheres Nick sleeping?
Id be happy to. Youre welcome.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now shes getting married.
Um, just about everyone.
I thought you said you were crap.
You heading to the train station?
Whats his problem?
Theres something about him thats just a bit odd.
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
Thats when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Oh, shut up. Youre an optician.
I didnt deserve her back then.
Nothing.
Hey.
Shrink, actually.
Crikey.
What?
Nothing, nothing.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
So, tell me, hows unmarried life?
Kat, we must talk. This guy, theres something not quite right.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Bollocks, Im sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
Hi. Hey.
What color are my shoes?
Mission accomplished.
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
I dont know.
What does your gut say?
No, count it, anyway.
Why?
What?
Its cute.
What is?
You stand on your tiptoes.
How did you know that was me?
I have a friend at the magazine.
Would you grab my shampoo?
Yes.
I guess so.
I swear. I dont have a signature move.
Its hard to explain.
Dont they have a limit at those machines?
And what if I didnt want you to...to do that to me?
Oh, cut the crap!
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
So, whyd you say yes to me?
Yeah. You?
Fourteen and hes hoodwinked by a an erector set?
And thats when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
Hi.
I should go.
What?! No, no. You cant--
Whats he do anyway?
Oh, no. He told you.
You knew?
Give it back? Are you nuts?
You want I nut him in the boat?
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
You want me to let him in?
Dad!
Hi, kiddo.
So whyd you let him go?
Not yet...
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?
I always wondered what happened with us.
Im guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.
Uh huh...
Here it is, right here.
That's where we come from first?
What's his name?
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
Well, how did you like the class, David?
Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
Yes, Miss Johnson...
No, Miss Johnson...
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
But, Charlie --
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
I did look, Charlie, but I--
You would do that, wouldn't you?
It's cold, Daddy!
It was too dark, Daddy.
He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.
David Lee...
I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none.
Well, looka here...
Hi, Daddy...
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
We didn't find Sounder yet.
Son, that was some trip you went on...
Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
Goodnight, Daddy...
Mornin', son...
Where's everybody?
Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.
You know somethin', Daddy?
What's that, son?
Mister, can you visit anybody here?
Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
When's that?
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
Miss Boatwright --
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.
David!
He eats all right -- his throat ain't scarred.
I don't look like no possum!
I guess I'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be.
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
That's right!
Ready to go, Mama!
You got two shirts on?
Who's winning, Mama?
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
Who is they?
Can I go when the holiday comes?
Any sign of Sounder?
What is it, David Lee?
Can I go day after tomorrow?
Good night, Mama...
What's that you carryin'?
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
Who's Miss Johnson?
So when I left, she gave me these books.
What's wrong with him, David?
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
What's wrong, Nathan?
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.
It's about the Three Musketeers.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
Would you like to have a cool drink, David?
You know where my father is, don't you, Miss Boatwright?
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
Come, I'll take you home.
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
Don't take all day at that table, David Lee.
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
Is he gon' be gone long?
Mama, what was we laughin' for?
Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta see.
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.
Hi ya, Rebecca...
Good mornin', Nathan.
Mornin'...
You ready to eat?
How's the weather out there?
Well, let's get to work!
Is there something I can do to help you?
I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
What...
What... are you?
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
Montana.
Good. Now 'Pillow'.

What?
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!
Ze alarms! Zey went off!
Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway.
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!
Suck my balls.
But they fucking didn't do anything wrong!
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!
Hey Cartman.
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
You guys! Seriously! You guys!
What Cartman?!

You've got a stupid accent too.
Eric, that is not appropriate.
The N word?
Norwegian Ass Raper.
Kyle?!
We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
What's going on, Chef?
Hello there, children!!
What's the secret to making a woman happy?
Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
Viva la Resistance.
Oh no, it's that kid.
May I?
WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
Purpre mama!
Donkey raping shit eater.
Yes I am!
Mph rmph rm rmph rm?

Mph mph.
Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!

Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
Who is it?
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
What's the password?
Guess.
Uhh... Bacon.
SHIT!
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
Dude, we don't have watches.
What's a butfor?
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
It's so very cold...
We can't leave without you!
This is terrible! This can't be happening!!
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!
How can they do this?
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
This is sweet!!
I'm so sick of these soldiers.
It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...
Wow, a lot of people showed up.
Shiteater-
What about air strikes?
And Bill?
Yes?
You're all part of Satan's army now!
SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
No, it was worse than that...
Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
Article 42!  You don't mean-?!
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!
You'd fuck your uncle!
Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.
Hello, Conan!
Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
Oh, you are such a maroon!
AGH!
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
Saddam, would you let me do my job please!
Who's my cream puff?
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
You know I do.
What did you do today Satan?
Don't call me dumb!
Hey, I'm missing the party!
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Did you see that, Wendy?
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
What the hell are you talking about, kid?
Hi Wendy.
NAZIS!!
What's the matter, Wendy?
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Wendy?
Stan! Stan are you okay?!
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
My friend the clitoris told me.
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
Stan, I never cared for Gregory.
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b>
You don't have watches?
Got it.
And ze rope?
Check.
Oh my God, what is he doing?
I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne.
Oh yeah...
Oh yeah...
Oh Sara...
Anna...
Jesus, come on!
Evening.
It can't be.
Excuse me?
Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
Oh, thank you.
Magnificent, magnificent.
Well I appreciate that.
Of course, of course...
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
And what are they doing now, Mac?
On channel 10?
Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.
What did you say to me?
No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?
It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
You want to go back to shuttle work?
You gotta think of your old age.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
I think I can handle it.
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
Bridge!  Can anyone hear me?!
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?
It's time we lock coordinates.
So, what are we waiting for?
Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
Is that clear?
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
Look at this...Jesus.
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
What's the use...we're gonna die...
We're going to die.
It's getting hard to breathe...
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
What are we going to do?
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
OK...it's open.
Seen one like it before?
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
He certainly is polite.
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.
Everyone just stay put.
I don't know what we're facing.
Are you ready?
Yeah.  We did it.
You're ready for the real thing?
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.
Do you want some advice?
Dawn!  Dawn!
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
Take this flare.
I'm not going with you.
Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
Dawn.  Come in.
I'm in the bridge.
He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.
I'm about to blow the wall.
I'll do my best.
So what's going to happen to you?
Hopefully sooner than later.
Sooner than later.
What the hell are you doing?
We have room!  Let's go!
What do you mean?  What happened!
So close...
Will you marry me?
Marry you?
What is it?!
I'm fine.
Congratulations on your...recent award.
Is there anything I can help you with?
Carlo!
I'm going back for Taylor!
I'm homesick.
Oh no...I think there's carrots in here...
Well now what are we gonna do!
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
What the hell is that?
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
Is it safe for human transport?
You're not from around here, are you?
I'm looking for a man.
What kind of man?
You a mini-golfer?
Can I get you something for the road?
You have orange whips?
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Yeah, basement bingo.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
Three whips. To go.
Hey, you still here?
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.
La da da dalala...
How do you know, you don't even speak Latin?
You know, Elvis bowled.
How do you turn this thing off?
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
You look like you're something on the lanes.
Theo's bowled on the tour.
Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
Buzz Fazeli.
I'm not on the tour this year.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
They suspended me for 100 years.
Where'd you get this ball?
It's mine.
Who gave it to you?
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
I got a right. You're my father.
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
What the fuck is this?
I'm your blood.
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
Theo, I want you to get out of this town.
You got a better offer?
We ain't married no more.
The whole world thinks you're underground.
I never saw you.
He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
Hello?
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
Don't tell me, John.
I don't like to talk about it.
Knock-knock.
Who's there!
You shouldn't touch her.
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.
Who's there?
Junior.
I have someone for you to play with Junior.
Someone wants to play with me?
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
Why would you help me?
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
You're just like you mother! Always jealous!
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
Look who's talking!
Fantastic! What talent.
Don't go near the bowling alley.
Hello, Mr.Kastle.
I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.
Grasp firmly. Then what?
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
Get that outta your mouth!
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
Where can I find him?
What's your specialty?
How do you want it?  The eggs.
Uh...over easy.
Do those two work for your dad or mine?
I came here to have a word with your dad.
Kinda tough on the butt.
Everything has it's drawbacks.
Where did your brother escape from?
The mental hospital.
Whoa.
Mind if I cut in?
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.
Can I ask you something personal?
I'd rather you didn't.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Not while I'm in training.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No. Do You?
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
So, what about you?
Do I want you?
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
Well, that was plan A.
What's plan B?
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
What's plan C?
I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
More than you could afford.
Come on, bargain with me.
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
Why should I help that old fuck.
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
Nothing.
I can't tell you, Theo.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
How do you get this thing down?
You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?
He's dead Sheila.
I feel sick.
You should.
Are you sure he's dead?
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
You don't get two chances with Junior.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
What about plan C?
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
Sez you!
Very professional.
I am a professional man.
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!
Tell your little pal to let go.
Very good, busyboy.
Your time is up, busyboy.
Calm down, Dr. Levine.
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
... Your civil rights have been overridden!
Open it, Captain!
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
They're warm.  I can feel the heat on my legs.
Fletcher, get away from there...
It's burning...
Get out of there!
I can't see...
Fletcher!  Now!
In basic English, what does all this mean?
There's heat coming the door.
Back away then.
Wait a minute --
I said back away.
Hold on --
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
They told me about sixty hours.
Nobody move.
But she's --
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
Direction's east coming!
Fifty yards and closing.
Forty yards.
What was that?
Increase positive pressure!
That's our reserve air.
Don't do it, Norman!
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?
Don't do it!
Norman, please!  Don't!
Captain.
What have you been told so far?
Anything else?
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
From what?  What's with all the security?
How deep is he?
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
Then why am I here?
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
Hold on --
Extraordinary, isn't it?
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
They pressurize us with helium.
What is it, Norman?
Maybe we shouldn't.
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
I don't know.  That's the point.
Harry's missing.
What do you mean, he's missing?
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
How drastic?
You don't want to know.
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
Wait a second --
-- and then brought her down here --
Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons.
That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
Going active.
What the hell?  It shut us down.
I see it.
Can you open that panel?
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
I'm getting no sub reading, sir.
Any sign of Harry?
Nothing, sir.
Yes, sir.
Well, where the fuck is he?
They've left, keep watching!
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
I did.
Ted?  Captain?
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
So how do we get it open?
Gimme a report, I want --
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
I have to tell you.  It's strange.
Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant.
With an "o".  Harold with an "o".
She's not gonna know.
I'd also like it noted --
Ted, get her away from the door.
Look at this.
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
How can he be missing?
They switched us over.
To what?
She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.
From the sphere?
I want a name.  A real name.  This thing's full name, rank and serial number.
What is that?
What was Edmunds doing outside?
Resetting the sub.
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
Because when we get down there --
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
You're next, Norman.
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
Where'd this come from?
The library.
My gosh, Norman.
Yeah, it was awful.
Wait a minute.
Yeah, why?
What?  Why...
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
I can't feel her bones.  She's like a sponge.
She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
Norman.
What are they?
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
Where did you get this?
In Edmunds' things.
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
What?
You did, didn't you?
Don't do this.
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Forget the sub.
Don't bother me, Norman.
You, me and Harry?
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
Maybe you should go.  To the sub.
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
In case you die, too?
I don't trust Harry to do it.
I would.  But my suit --
You fixed my suit?
You don't trust me?
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
What's the matter?
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
Still clear?
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
The refridgerator.
That wasn't in there before.
We must've had it delivered then.
Wait a second --
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
You think?
Page 87.
He translated it wrong.
But how?
I don't know.
Looks like some sort of code.
Diphenyl parlene.
Something for burns.
It's for motion sickness.
Valdomet.
Ulcers.
Sintag.
Nothing about drowsiness.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Riordan?
Antihistamine.  For bites.
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
Parasolutrine?
How do you spell it?
P-a-r-a-s-o...
What's that?
How long does it last?
Three to six hours.
I'll just boost the doses.
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
How fast does it take effect?
To be on the safe side.  I mean --
You ever given an injection before.
I'm sorry.
For what?
What is it, Norman?
Where are you?
The sphere looks different.
What's wrong, Norman?
I'm feeling better.
It's getting cold.
You think I'd really drink that?
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
You tell me.
Do you fear them?
Don't you?
No, he isn't.
He can't manifest.
Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.
C'mon -- what?
That's when you went in the sphere.
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
That's bullshit.
Don't, Beth.
But I have to, Norman.
I promise --
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
Don't, Beth.  Please.
Beth!
Where is it coming from, Beth?
Beth?
You can't stop it, Norman.  You can't fight me.
I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
C'mon --
What?
You hear that?
Hear what?
Get away from me!
Beth --
No.  I don't think so.
I don't get it.
He doesn't wait for an answer.
For who?  The fish?
Then what is it?
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
Just in time, too.
In time for what?
What?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Like what?  I'm not --
You're staring at me.
We can refuse to talk.
How are you feeling, Norman?
What?
You holding up alright?
Fine.  I'm fine.
Don't be defensive.
I'm not being defensive.
Go ahead.  Ladies first.
C'mon.
C'mon, Norman.
Nice work, Norman.
Our answer.
To what?
This answers one of our questions.
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
I can't believe that, Harry.
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
No.  I didn't say that.
What is that?  That noise?
What noise?
Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
What are you still doing here?
You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
You don't understand about the sphere.
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
Did I?
Harry?
Norman, where are you?
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
What happened to her?
What do you mean?  She's not here?
When I woke up, nobody was here.
Her suit's gone.
Beth left?
She's cracking, Norman.
Wisconsin's your answer.
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
How do we decode it?
What is it?
It's the squid!  Stop it!
Did I kill her?
We're never gonna make it.
How much time you figure to get to the surface?
I can't reach her.
Push her, c'mon.
Hold on.
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
C'mon, Norman!
I'm trying to keep balance with --
Her legs are in the way.
No idea.
Well, press something!
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
There is one possibility.
She told me what you said, Norman.
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
English?
You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.
But it's impossible.
All the facts you need are right in front of you.
Do you?
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Please.  It must have flown here --
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
What'd you say?
Good idea, Ted.
Does this mean what I think it means?
How are the others?
The others, sir?
Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
No, they didn't say --
What report?
Huh?
What report?
You mean you don't know?
Who's everyone?
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
He wasn't feeling well.
Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
I don't see anything.
Squint harder.
Please, Ted.
Try this one.
Well, he's polite.
What was it?
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
What kind of a crash was it?
Don't be so supportive, honey.
Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
What?
Was it a military crash?
I think there are some things we should talk about.
We'll be back before you are, old man.
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.
I know that.
You saw through me?
You could put it that way.
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
What's wrong?  What's happening?
What is it?
I can't see!  How can I fight?
Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
Of course, where you been kid?
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
You're Starkiller?
Yes, sir.
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.
Yes, sir, but I can get him...
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
We don't get many visitors.  Let's take a look at it.
Where are you taking us now anyway?
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.
Who's the pilot?
I found it... It's just not there.
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
This isn't going to work.
Why didn't you say so before.
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
I think she's going to be all right.
Get to the ship!
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
We'll send a squad up.
No need, everything's under control.
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.
See Threepio... do you copy?
Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...
What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
Something... I've got...you don't.
You rich kids... are all the same !
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
It's what I deserve.
No, this hurts.
Mobile Infantery rules !
Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
He was our teacher... He was great.
Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
What's the hurry ?
Yeah, but I want Carmen.
Don't think about it... go on instinct.
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
I don't believe it !
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
Are you alright ?
So what are you doing later ?
I'm all ears.
Or...?
They revoke our flight status.
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said...
Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
WHERE IS IT ?
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
Funny...
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
Carmen...?
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
Where are you going ?
How do you feel about him now ?
I don't know, Zander.
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
Zander, what are you doing ?
Good for you.
She's flying starships !
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
I don't want everyone to see.
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
Carl can wait.
Isn't it great to be in love ?
How do I know if this is love ?
Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
None at all... We won.
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
Zander is going for pilot, too.
I can't help it.
He's nothing like you.
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
Who cares ?
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
You talk to Carl ?
I'm gonna miss you.
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
I thought you were KIA, Johnny...
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
Take care, wilya Johnny ?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
Alright, take her out, Ibanez.
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
Guess you gotta go.
Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
No thanks, Diz.
Man, they're defended... no way in.
Flip six, three hole.
Cover me.
It stinks, you goin.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
Way to go, amigo !
You used to dance...
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
Hey, Diz...
What frequency ?
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
Oh, my, what's that ?
Looks like rain.
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
Is that your signature, Rico ?
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Are your parents currently citizens ?
Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
What do you think you're doing ?
Let's go.
How bad are you, pal ?
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
Mister Rasczak ?
All dead except one, sir.
Kill the bitch.
Yes, sir !
Who is...'V'ger'...?
V'ger is that which programmed me.
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
The Creator is that which created V'ger.
Who is V'ger?
The examination is a normal function.
<U>Why</U>?!
The Creator has not answered.
Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?
They have repressed the Creator.
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
Our data is being prepared.
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
Departure angle on viewer.
It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
Yes.
We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
Then you acted properly, of course.
I'm aware of that, sir.
Stop competing with me, Decker!
Permission to speak freely, sir?
If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
<U>Computer off</U>!
It's taken control of the computer...!
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us; they could have done that outside.
They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
Forward motion, Captain...!
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. 
Hello, Ilia.
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
'Commander' Decker?
Time to impact...?
Mr. Spock?
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Hold station.
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
One hundred kilometers...
Viewer ahead.
Hold station...!
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
Not for us?
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
We're ready, sir.
Dock control reports ready, sir.
Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming...
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
Cal...
Annie...got an umbrella...?
Mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.
I'll be there.
You bringing your new friend?
Sure plan to.
He have any special dietary requirements...?
He'll eat potroast and like it.
Go you Huskies?
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
I want to rent this one.
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
Who?
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
You haven't heard of it.
What's it called?
I quit.
I quit the movie.
Yes.
Why?
Could you tell me when's the next train?
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
You get what you pay for.
That's true.  You grow up here?
Yes...
But, but but but...
No, no, I see...
That: in an act of...
Yes...
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
I understand...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
And likewise.
Goodbye.
I live there.
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might...
...such a pleasant sound.
Yes...
What are you doing?  I love your script.
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
You'd know better'n me.
What I need to <u>say</u>...
<u>Yes</u>...
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
Me?
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
I thought you had Play Practice.
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
What happened?
Cast stood me up.
What are you doing down there?
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
...lost the screw...
You like kids?
Paperclip?
Fix my glasses.
Great.  Who is it...?
"Room Service!"
Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside.
Oh, God...
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
I don't drink.
Thank you.
The other side.
Later on.
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
You can do it.
Because I'd met someone else.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
I used to go out with a politician.
Sure did.
Yes.
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
What's the scene...
It used to be the Old Mill.
Ah.  Ah.  Ah...
...yes.
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
That's right...
Hi.
Hi.
Where you going?
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
How's your star?
Gosh, you look nice.
What would you do with it, the printshop...
Press still works.
It does?
Best way I know to get ink on your hands.
You'd do the newspaper right here.
That's something a man could do...?
Good morning.
Yeah, you?
Now you're talking...
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
Not without a rolltop desk.
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
What is it all about?
But it'll stop the movie.
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
Carla was in the car, right?
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
What are you going to do?
If I go to jail...?
Morning, darling.
Water or mineral deposits.
We on for tomorrow night?
After Drama Group.
What is it, a surprise?
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...
What, what what are you doing here?
Ten thousand dollars.
That's so beautiful...
Hi!
We had a date.
Where have you been...
He works on the movie.
No.  Don't tell me that.
I'm sorry.
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
Well, then, what's he doing here?
He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
What courthouse?
Courthouse back in town.
Town ain't got no courthouse.
Well, where do they hold court?
They're holding it for ransom.
It'll hurt the box office.
He's on the ph...
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
...they run on water.
How big is this horse?
Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill?  Hey, Bob.
That's right.
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
They think it's your First Wife...
Then she wasn't in the car.  <u>Say</u> it.
...upset and impressionable...  Get me the Mayor...
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
What'll I do for fun?
Whyn't you learn your lines?
Bobby, don't say anything.
I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you...
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
Isn't he...
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you like some?
I don't eat vegetables.
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
Sure, what have you got?
Bourbon and Milk.
How old are you?
Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.
Are you all right...?
I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion <u>Picture</u>.
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Tell it with...
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
She's a...
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
What...
Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don't need...
Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
<u>Bobby</u>...
No, I...just...just Joe, just Joe...
Joe, the writer?
How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
Of course he...
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
It's night.
Aren't you ever in school?
There's other things to be learned.
Izzat so?
The Mayor's outside.
What's his name?
Nobody touched me, I was at home.
Who is it raped you?
Nobody.
No.
I wasn't in the car.
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
You have no right to...
Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
I, actually yes.
I love Jewish men.
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
I like you, too.
But not that <u>way</u>...
But we...
You have to hide.
That's my...
Oh.
Claire, when did you...
I just...
We're just talking about the...
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
What...?
I can't do it, Walt.
I know that...
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
I...I...
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
Wally...
...yes...
...wants a piece...
Yes.
And you know what...?
We, we have to give it.
Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
I...
An artist of your caliber...
I know...
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
...yes...
...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
You show Claire these sketches?
Yes.
Did she throw up?
I can't tell.
Why not?
Kiss my ass.
What?
Who got their heads cut?
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
You said <u>three</u>...?
Where you off to?
I, uh...I'm leaving.
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
Main Street.
I have to talk to you.
Arrest him.
What is the...?
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
He told you that...
He didn't have to tell...
I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
Later for you, pal.
What's in the case?
I'm looking for the writer.
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
How about that.
Mmmm.  You have children?
Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
He should be put in jail.
You should.
I had a witness I would.
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
Who's White...?
The writer.
He saw the accident...?
He saw the girl in the car...
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
We're out of money.
I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
I can only write on a manual.
Grace...
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
I want to make a good film.
What's the...
I can't.
I'm gonna nail it.
Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
I'm out.
I don't getcha.
The girl was in the car.
I treated you like a son or nephew.
It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
No, what is it?
I have to tell the truth.
The girl was in the car.
You can't write it?
What did you say to them...?
I didn't say anything to them.
How do you know you saw it?
I don't know.
I don't...
You didn't see it...
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
You cool the broad out?
I left that for you.
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
How was your flight?
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
Did you bring Bob's weights?
They're coming Fedex...
<u>Stop</u>...
<u>Pay</u> her.
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
Pay her off.
We don't have the money.
<u>Find</u> it.
If you do the product placement...
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
We got the permit.
Is that one hell of a kid?
He's got a gift for fiction.
She wasn't in...you were al...
There's no witnesses...
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
I've got two days to get this house...
Don't you <u>touch</u> that...I want them gone.
I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
I want them thrown in jail.
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
Well, you know, Walt, I just wanted to say that anything I could do...
You hear that?
She coulda done better than him.
"Assembly of Death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
You think so?
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
Ain't no second chances in life.
Where are we?
We have to lose the window.
We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?
But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;
Ben!  What's wrong?
I'd rather be with Mommy.
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
It just slipped out.
Scream.
How would you know sh...
...why do you think?
So why are you asking me?
What are you gonna talk about?
Then why are you putting on mascara?
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
That happens.  To families.
Wow.  Who's that for?
Like a big sister.
And don't tell her I told you.
I can't hear you.
I said...
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
This'll work, huh?
Annabelle...wake up honey...
Mom?  What's wrong?
I don't want to say goodbye.
I'll miss you so much.
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
I'm sorry, okay?  Let's not fi...
This is my daddy's house --
This is my house too!
C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...
She still packing for her trip?
Why don't you say hello?
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That doesn't bother me.
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
And you<u>don't</u> tell her.  What you're going to say.
Not use my words, please!
Ice cold water.
I hate her.  I really hate her.
There you are!
No they're not.
Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!
You do NOT run out on your moth...
You know, this horse smells really bad.
...your hating me.
No.
You touched it.
No.
Excuse me --
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
Are you <u>real</u> mad?
...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!
IS THAT YOU?
Poof!  You're happy now.
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Mommy?
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
That I do.  Always will.
ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!
No.
Mommy's sick, guys.
You have the WORST flu since...
So you're okay.
No!  I have to get there.
Where Ben?
Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
Find the bird cage?
But you can still see him.
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
You say that like I don't know that.
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
So we'll...radiate some more?
You're making a <u>career</u> decision here, I would <u>strongly</u> sugg...
Planning on getting --
Are you here?
I'm here.
Something's up wi...
Rachel's not half my age.
We're not discussing your age.
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
I'm worried.
Easy enough.
Called him.  We set an ap...
I'm afraid she's going to walk.
We...
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
We're going to win this.
What happens next?
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
Get out!
Machines do not EAT message.
She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
So why did y...
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
I'm sorry, I just...
She was angry at herself.
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
Nobody likes a snoop.
Did I hear the word...
I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.
You bet you are.
How the hell would you know?
They came out of my <u>body</u>!
Okay, I'm undeserving.
And you said...?
So.  Hopeful.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
The primo stuff is great for pain.
He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
And you said...
Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
It's just not the right time t...
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
My advice to you?  Don't die.
Is that what he told you?
Are we.
And I'm going to win.
Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
Thanks for coming out.
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
You're lying.
Why didn't I?
With good reason.  They fucking worship you as it is.
What do I have that you don't?
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
You're the hip and fresh.
You ride with Annabelle...
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
So I'll have to order in?
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
You don't trust me to be alone with them.
Look.  I know they hate me.
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
Get ready.  To get <u>really</u> mad.
And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
I think so...What do you think?
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
It's just an assignment.
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
She's not gonna die.
What a great surpri...
Well, they will be.
She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.
Can we go sit somewhere?
I told her I loved her.
Where you goin'?
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
Does Jackie know this?
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
Maybe he's gay.
Don't ever say that.
What if he is?
Out! Leave the table!
Hey.
There are some rumors...
Like what?
You know...Stanley...
No prob. I'm cool.
Marty, ignore him.
He was in a concentration camp?
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
Welcome to the show, Scooby.
Nice to have you here.
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Consuelo?
Yes.
Really? How many?
I did not go to high school.
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
We had to work. My family was poor.
Must've been hard being poor.
Mi Jesusmi jesus
Speak English.
Who is Jesus?
My baby.
You have a bay?
He's dead.
He wasn't.
But still, you can't be sure.
I am sure.
But really, you never know.
Why was he on Death Row?
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
No, you don't.
Yes, I knowBut still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
What's an audience going to tell you?
Mom?
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.
Was anyone in my room today?
What are you going to do?
We did the same thing last year also.
Fine.
Ready for tomorrow?
I can read it to you.
You mean, again?
Well, I changed the ending a little.
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
You're tired of me. I can tell.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
What do you want?
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
You know he hated my story also.
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
But what kind of pull did you have?
So? How was school today?
The same.
The same. Same as what?
Get the hell outta here!
Scooby?
Yeah?
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.
One in a million recover.
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
Hey, Mikey!
Hi, Dad!
Come here, give me a hug!
What are you doing here?
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
Uh huh.
No.
It's over there.
...gger.
Nigger.
'Fuck me hard!'
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
Again!!
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Hello?
Hello, is this Pam?
Who is this?
Toby Oxman.
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Oh, fine. How are you?
Great!
Great!
So what's going on?
That's what I was gonna ask you.
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
Oh, I don't remember that...
Yeah. But not any more.
Yeah.
Huh. Kids?
Yeah.
How many?
Three.
Yeah, sure.
Pretty cool, Stanley.
Thanks.
Gee, your Dad's smart.
I know.
Is it loaded?
Scooby, don't! Be careful!
Scooby?
Yeah?
You know...I like you.
Yeah. I know.
You want some?
You a pervert?
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
He did?
Yeah. He went to Harward.
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
Well, I-I hope that--that--
Well get someone down there!
I'll lead.
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
What are we going to do!
What now?
--be prepared.
We don't have time!
Let's move it we got company!
What's that supposed to mean?
Cooper...
Now what?
I have a lighter!
Are the labs in operation?
That's it!  Up ahead!
Are you going to kill us?
Come on, drink up.
She's still alive.
What about Cooper--where is he?
Who's Ryan Cooper?
So, what are we looking at White?
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.
Good.
I say we head out.
Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
Drop the anchor!
We can't--it's power driven!
Just what the hell is he talking about?
Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
What does that mean?
Can I have a glass of water?
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Possibly some coffee?
Don't be ridiculous.
Where are you trying to reach him?
At his office in the Capitol.
Where is this...thing?
That's preposterous!  We have no such program!
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
That's nonsense, and you know it!
Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
Perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source?
My seven body orifices????
Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
Now, snap out of it, fella!
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
What is your name, young lady?
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
Yes!
Well, Mister President.
Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
This is General Ripper speaking.
Yes, sir.
Do you recognize my voice?
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.
Who do you think you're talking to?
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
Plan-R????
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?
I suppose they are, sir.
How much soda, sir.
What shall we drink to, sir?
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
Major, you're talking like one of them!
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
To peace on earth, Major.
It was a honest mistake, sir.
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
General Jack D. Ripper, sir.
I want to talk to General Ripper.
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
Naturally I am, sir.
He says they've only shot down three planes.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Yeah, to see if we're on our toes.
Give me a first rough course as soon as you can, Lieutenant Ballmuff.
I've got the heading, Major.  One-three-eight.
Roger, maintain.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
All right...we're still flying.  I'm taking her down to the deck.
Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
What else could it be?
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
Maximum ECM.
Then this is it.
What?
War.
I'm sorry, Major Kong.  I guess I was way out of line.
Speed?
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
Why can't he help me now?  He's sitting two feet away from me!
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.
They can't touch us at this height.
I think they mean business.
Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.
No, this looks like the real thing.
Primary arming switch.
Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
Where'd they get you?
What does it look like?
Some kind of signaling.
Are you saying our order don't make sense?
When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
Primary circuit is live.
Release first safety.
Second safety.
Fusing for ten thousand air burst.
Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?
Everything still checks out okay.
Can't "Ace" help you?
He's dead.
Where'd they get you?
How do you know he's dead?
He's dead, all right.
No, look!  It's "OPE - Recall Mistake."
What do you mean?
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
Why should they call us back?
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
Like hell it does.
The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
That's the point.
I don't get you, King.
Take it easy, Major Kong.
We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
Who's that?
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
Maybe the warning system's out.
But I get a red light.
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
I don't anymore.
Can I have some?
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
Sure, all the time, in Group.
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
That was really great.
Was it okay?
Yeah!
What did you guys think?
Responsibility, progress.
Typical male.
Typical male.
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
No I quit.
Yup.
What's it about?
It's really not about anything.
Oh. Well, what's it on?
A cloud.
Right now?
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
And your mom.
No, I'm here. Where are you?
Stuck with what guy?
It's your birthday?
Pony's coming here to the corner?!
That's the rock star thing.
Sorry.
You wanna bet he's with a girl?
No, he's not with a girl.
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
A long, long, long, long, while.
Okay, okay.
A long, long, long...
So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
You know what we should do? Go to the...
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
No. Life is too short.
No, I'm not worried.
Sure.
No, I mean, no one.
Yeah.
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
Oh, and guess who showed up.
I know, man.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Y- s-sure it did.
No. It didn't, Buff.
Wait. Hey, man.
What?
Look.
Hey, man.
She's in the van.
Buff...
What?
She's dead.
Bullshit.
No, no, no.
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.
Hey, I'm Sooze.
Yeah.
Great.
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
Your his publicist?
Sure I am. It's fun.
What do you mean? His girlfriend?
Well, that's one way of putting it.
Am I fucking him?
So, then, you're, like, available?
In what way?
Buff.
Yes! Free concert!
Hey! Hey.
I'm so burnt-out.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
I can come visit?
You better! Yes!
Score! Yeah!
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Hey, we're just having a conversation.
It's safe, come on.
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
Are you talking to me?
It's okay.
Good. See you later.
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
Oh, you were there?
No, but I heard it was great.
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
Whoa!
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
You could do it.
I could.
Yeah!
Yes!
Yeah!
You okay, man? You okay?
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright.
Thanks, man!
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
Okay.
Come on. Inside.
Hi.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
You rich?
No, not really. Middle-class.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
Thinks he is. Well, he is.
He is?
Yes.
He is.
What'd he get you?
Mm.
I'd like to.
Oh, yeah?
What was your name again?
Deep down. Way down.
It's a mistake to think that.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
It's nice to do a lot of things.
That's what I mean.
I'm not a nice guy.
I know. It's okay.
No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
Oh, sure.
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
Um, mother-daughter.
It's coming along.
Two-fifty.
Can you tell me what happened?
He's drunk.
Who were you talking to?
Yeah, yeah, I stay at the Four Seas, it's ease.
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
Tim, what are you talking about?
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
What? What'd you do?
That chick, Erica?
What'd you do?
You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
Why? Because I give a shit?
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
I don't know.
You don't know?
Just go home, alright?
No.
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
Jeff! Come up here!
Is that Bee-Bee?
What?
Seven-twenty.
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
Nazeer what?
God, I haven't seen you all day.
Oh! Trim it!
No.
It's a piece.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
Yes, you asshole.
Of course I do!
Name one.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
One!
Your completely missing the point.
Hey!
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
But do you stand for anything?
Yes, I stand for -
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
Can I talk?
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
This is ridiculous!
Oh, yeah?
Okay, what would you have done.
I would've stopped it.
What feelings?
Us.
Of course.
And?
Nothing.
No one does nothing, Jeff.
New ground?
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
You do.
Come on.
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
Oh, yeah?
I, yeah.
God, you smell like whiskey.
No, no, I have to talk to you.
Where are you going?
For a ride.
Wait, away?
To his hotel?
I've run out of words.
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
Oh, no, no, no.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
You did, huh? Good for you.
'Bye, Jeff.
Go.
What?
Hey, Pony.
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Yeah, I crash there.
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
Sorry.
So you think I should?
Like songs?
Yeah, they could be songs.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Now?
Great.
Well, not exactly.
So who are you?
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
Oh, yeah.
Hey, where's Erica?
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
Get off my property!
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Ready?
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
No, this has everything to do with you.
Pony, oh my god!
Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
Is that your driver?
It's stupid.
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
Look at you!
Oh, yeah?
So? What's L.A. like?
It's pretty exciting.
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
You're not serious.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Yeah?
Yeah, come on, play it.
Alright, alright already.
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
I can't believe you're still here.
I'm moving.
If...
No, I'm going.
Soon.
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know. I say what I mean.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
Is that Jeff?
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
What the fuck are you talking about?!
"See what's around you listen to their lies"
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
It's none of my business?
Don't do that.
If you hit me...
Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?
Just one?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
So where are you?
Seriously? It's a great idea.
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
No car.
The fuck not?
You know the fuck not.
Fuck.
I just pulled and it - it came off.
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Holy shit.
I'm in, too.
Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!
Another sex dream?
Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.
Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
You sure?
... I don't know.  Probably not.
But, we have to make a smart plan!
Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four.
She thinks you went to the police.
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
Y'think?
Jack, I think I should get a job.
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
That was gas, Sweetie.
Oh... What are you working on?
Madonna.
Hat-trick?
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
NO!  Wait...um...  We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? So, uh...
Oh no...
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
That you?
Hello?
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Ammo?
Screw Lucy!
Is that you down there?
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
Really...
Yeah.  This summer at church camp?  I'm pretty sure I had, y'know, an orgasm.
Oh my G-d!  I'm not first!
You sure you wanna go there?
All of you!
Bank branch!
You shouldn't smoke so many of those.
My what?
Now how the hell can I help you?
My best friend got pregnant.
More proof God's a guy...
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
What the hell do you want?
Roll 'em.
Give me your coat.
Let it ride for a while.
You're going to stay, aren't you?
That was the general idea.
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
What's wrong with it?
It's from hunger.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
Hurt feelings department.
You forgot this.
I've been hoping to run into you.
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
Why, you sweet kid.
I didn't.
Is there someplace we can talk?
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
You'll be waiting for me?
With a wildly beating heart.
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
He thinks it could be made into something.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
I tell you this is half sold.
Sorry if I crossed you up.
You sure have.
I'll make it short.
It's just impossible.
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
Who's Norma?
I'll say.  This is solid gold.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
May I say you smell real special.
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Why not?
It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
I don't want it now.
What happened?
This is where you live?
You bet.
Hers.
Joe, I can't look at you any more.
Hello, young fellow.
Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
That's what I want to talk to you about.
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.
Just a minute, you!
Yeah?
You're a writer, you said.
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
And you'll play Salome?
Well?
This is fascinating.
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
What month?
You know, I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.
I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
It's getting kind of late --
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
Where do you live?
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
There sure is.
You can stay here.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
What's that?
Just a scene I cut out.
Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
How about some evening clothes?
I don't need a tuxedo.

You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
Don't bend back like that.
Who?
What are the notes?
What right do you have to take me for granted?
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
You're really going to send it to De Mille?
Have one of mine.
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
I ran into some people I knew.
Where are my cigarettes?
You'd better get to bed yourself.
I think I'll read a little.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
I went for a walk.
Yes, I am, Norma.
The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
That's a lie!  They still want me!
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
Look, maybe I'd better take my car --
Suppose you listen just for a minute -
Madame is waiting.
This room has not been used for a long time.
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
I'm not here.
That's what I told them.
Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.
How come?
The doctor suggested it.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
How is she?
You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
We've come for the car.
Got a title?
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
Along is no good.  I need it now.
Haven't got a thing.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
Madame is wanted on the telephone.
You know better than to interrupt me.
Paramount is calling.
Who?
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
What is the scene? Where am I?
This is the staircase of the palace.
What is it?
Is he your entertainment for tonight?
A Storm Dragon?
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
I think I'd better keep it.
Whatever you say.
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
I don't feel like it right now.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
What do you want?
Is this Nigel's doing?
It's a warning, that's for sure.
Wait...don't leave me in here...
What's happening?
I'm taking you to the hospital.
Don't leave me.
I have to.
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
We have to have a long talk about all this.
This is my favourite place in the city.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
Like it?
Yes. It reminds me of home.
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
Let's talk about us, not her.
We can't do that.
Why not ?
All this talk about love, it's silly.
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
What's that?
Let me kiss you.
No.
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
I don't love you any more.
Away. From you.
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
I sort of like what you said.
That makes it worse.
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
I'm not mad at you.
You think so?
I don't see why not.
But what if---it wasn't real?
Are you asking me for a "date"?
Before you go...
It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
How do I fight it?
She's right. They'll string her up.
Hey! Ethan!
I did.
Finished your estimate?
Well, there's several ways to go .
You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
What is it?
A passionfruit smoothee.
Oh no, not you again.
What an adorable hat.
They think I have a concussion.
And you think you're in love.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
I don't want your help.
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
Guess! Go on.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
Well...I guess I can't.
You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.
Hey, where you going?
I've got things to do.
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
Can I give you a lift?
Yes.
Did anybody notice you?
I can't help it if men notice me.
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
You bet your ass.
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
What are you making:
You see, a tree is a living thing.
There isn't any.
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
You're not...an orphan are you?
She did that deliberately.
How'd you do that?
Your hair looks the same.
No thanks. You go on.
Why is he acting so strangely?
Lucy; come back!
Don't you believe in knocking?
What can I do for you?
No plans for the weekend, Linda?
What? Me?
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
Balefire on you, Selena!
Nigel, get lost.
I have to talk to you.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
That was meant for me!
A cheap trick.
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
Where is inner space?
I was on Earth...
Others?
Zaltar, please help me.
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
There is a way.
But it's impossible.
You can use the wand.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
Don't stop. Keep moving.
What are you talkin' about?
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
Not enough vodka in it.
There's no vodka in it.
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
You know what's the problem?
You...um...you never got married?
But all he had was chocolate milk.
Gee, I haven't done this in years.
Peanut butter and jelly.
I can never get a way from it.
He really was!
Uh-huh.
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
Uh...excuse me, folks...
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
Do you really know Superman?
So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
Name?
Yeah.
Kitchen. . . Technician
Dishwasher? Any luck?
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
Sonofagun! Look at this here!
So where is all them half-centses?
How many sugars?
Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
Gus?
Say what?
The boss wants to see you.
You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
Black or regular?
Man, what is this?
Which country?
Columbia.
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
Just the man I wanted to see!
Turn on the T.V.
I did. isn't it neat-o?
Uh...what channel were you watching?
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
KRYPTONITE!
And do nothing. Just sit there.
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
Fair's fair.
For what?
A computer.
What will it do?
Everything.
Anything.
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
Stone mutha.
You want to mess with Superman?
Watch out for them air pockets!
No, we're just going down.
We gonna crash?
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
Who's the other woman?
What about me?
Thank ...you.
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
There's no rush.
Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
Lots of things...
I don't know you, lady.
How would you know?
Hey, I know a lot of things!
Turn on the light.
Where's the light switch?
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
I can't! It's out of control!
53.
Mr. White, the next number, please?
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
85,000 dollars.
That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????
I don't kiss.
Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
It could make weather!
Storms! Floods!
She's not his mama either.
Today coffee----
Small potatoes.
We already have a super-tanker.
Where did it come from?
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
Come on, let's give it a dry run.
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
Jimmy, how's the -
Anybody been hurt?
Hostages?
Are you okay?
Lois, I usually do.
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
Lois, what are you doing?
Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
Maybe I could try --
It is kinda romantic.
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
Lois, you're amazing.
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
Oh Clark, no!
It's true. It's true.
Lois, I . . .
I was right. you are Superman.
Maybe you wanted to.
We'd better talk.
I want to.
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
Hi.
Sleep well?
Everything on it?
Does Lois know about this yet?
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
You'll miss the battle of the century!
Good. My heart can't take it.
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
This way Lex.
I'll be alright.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
It's beautiful.
It has everything.
Artemis? Do you read me?
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
I think he said a "curl."
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
I want my Liberace record back tonight.
Where?
North.
Why?
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.
He flies as well, then . . .
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .
Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
There is something more you want. The 								greed is written on your face.
What more?
Put down Lex Luthor !
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
Free!
		DELETE IN CUTTING
So this is the planet Houston . . .
What shall we do now?
You are master of all you survey.
General --- ?
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
You're late. Very late.
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.
Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
Oh . . . my . . .
Gee, I'm really sorry.
I'm not so sure you do.
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
Daddy . . . ?
Yes, darling?
I think there's an angle.
And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
But he's never there.
What's he going to say?
What's that?
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.
Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
Hey! He looks . . . normal.
Hey! Just remember I made you.
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
We'll all fry.
You are . . .
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
I am an experiment? I am freako?
Destroy Superman!
Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!
Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
Superman. . .  But you're... dead!
You're a great architect, Albert.
I've been on the job.
A hot story, huh?
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
Mom...
Mother...
Do you know where you're headed?
Keep warm now.
I'd like to.
Your bookie?
Actually, she's silver-haired.
Not...gray.
Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
Some people aren't the athletic type.
Hey!
Stop him, Clark!
He may have a gun!
You described the exact contents of my purse.
What now, my love?
Huh?
Can I take you to the airport?
Not unless you can fly.
Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -
You're just jealous.
Jealous? Of what?
What'd you call him?
Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
Screaming
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
Again???
You think he's for real?
Bet he makes it.
Shut up.
Damn!  This will get him.
What's the temperature now?
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
I read the article.
You're happy, aren't you?
Ready?
Don't let me down.
You?! How about me?
No news is not good news. Y'know
There was a recipe on the back  --
A night on the town instead of under it?
This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
Oh. Why? does he live up here?
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
I'm wearing it.
I mean the other one!
You can't do this to me!
But you can't ignore these facts!  It's suicide!  Worse than that, it's genocide.
Then -
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
Gets you where you live, huh?
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
The good lord works in mysterious ways.
What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
-- as we will be.
But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
He will be odd, different.
You've been doing some research in the archives.
Enjoyed it?
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
No! You couldn't imagine -
How good it felt!
Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
Easy now, miss, I've got you???
Do as I say. Let go!
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
With my luck, now it'll rain.
Superman???
Right on the first guess.
I came to talk to you.
Oh, I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
You think they're strange?
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
It must feel great.
It's not bad.
How old are you?
Thirty-five.
How much do you weigh?
What about it?
Can you really see through anything?
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
Sure.
Do you like pink?
Very much.
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
What's the matter, Otis?
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
I broke the man out of prison --
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
I gave him steady employment --
I gave him this new face.
Please...
Is that real enough for you?
You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
They're killing me by inches!  Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.
Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
Of time, Luthor.
On radio waves?
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
Yes.
Ally.  That was my nickname.
Ally.  That's right.
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
Ally Jones.
How is Mrs. Stephens?
We're...not together.
I'd heard that.  But she's well?
Yes...fine.
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
Which one?
Which one?
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
Then...when did she get better?
She didn't.
But you said...
That's where I'm going.  To see her.
What...does it turn to?
I'm...so sorry.
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
Alison.
Alison.
I will.
I hope she gets better.
I understand.
I can help you.
Hi, Nicole.
Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...
They just finished supper.
I'll be back around nine.
Are you sure?
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
Billy, please.  The children.
How is Nicole?  Is she around?
She's resting.  In her room.
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.
Because it's what we have to do.
No, Billy.  We can't drop the lawsuit.  You know how much we need the money.
She said she's got to be home by nine.
Have you been waiting long?
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
Yes.
It's natural.
You're leaving.
Good night, Billy.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
You believe that?
I have to.
Why?
Because I have to.
What do you mean by that, Dolores?
About the Ottos?
I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...
For rabbits?
From what?
You talked about it?
Berry-picking.
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
And what's that?
Were his parents...attentive to him?
What do you mean?
That's right.
Did his parents attend to that?
What do you mean?
That would complicate things.
He knows that?  Billy?
Yes.  He does.
You've talked to Billy?
What other people?
You heard what Abbott said?
Yes.
Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.
What do you think?
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
You hate it.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.
No.  A little sugar though.
We've only got honey.
Isn't it a lovely day?
What happened to summer?
Summer's over.  It's fall.
And winter?
Is this mine?
Yes.  It's a present.
Nicole!
Did he say what about?
Is he coming over now?  Right away?
It's like a song.
Nicole?
Nicole?
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
The people in the town?
Yes.
So he was mean?
Oh.
Should I keep reading?
That you didn't die?  Like the other children?
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
I won't lie.
You seem very sure about that.
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
I have no questions.
Do you have a room?
Will you be spending more than a night?
What do you mean?
What do they do?
Tell me about it.
Almost three.
Perfect.
Here we go.
DADDY!!!
Yes, I'll accept the charges.
Daddy?
News?
Don't you want to hear?
Yes.
I tested positive.
Yes.
I need money.
Do you have the blood test?
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
Some more wine?
We do.
Is there shrimp on it?
If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
Who are you?
I'm a lawyer.
You've been retained?
Are you expensive?
Are you a reporter?
What time in the morning was this?
About eight-thirty in the morning.
And where did you sit that morning?
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
Yes.
You remember that much?
You are?
Before the actual accident?
Yes, I understand.
Why were you scared?
Seventy-two miles an hour.
You saw the speedometer?
No.
I was scared.  And there wasn't time.
That was great.
You're going to blow everyone away.
You mean it?
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
What took so long?
What's that?
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
How do you like it, Nicole?
The ramp?
Pretty slick, eh?
Very slick.
Do you like the colour?
The door needs a lock.
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
Nothing good on your T.V.?
Are you sleeping?
What's going to happen to Dolores?
I don't know.
She'll move away.
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
Is "he" inside?
But of course...
Hello, Sidney.  Wanna table?
Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
He's somewhere...
Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please.
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.
See my mother?
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
How is dear old J.J. by the way?
And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
Does he have to be here in our hair?
Why, has he bothered you before?
Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill.  Just give us the punch line...
You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
Not being partial, are you?
Sidney is a liar!
Who said Sidney?
Susie, I'm sorry if---
No!  NO!  Don't touch me!
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.
Hello, Harry.
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
Can I come in for a minute?
Mac!  I don't want this man at my table...
I know Manny Davis.
Match me, Sidney...
What, some cheap, gruesome gags?
Spahish...that must show he likes "spigs", too.
J.J., I want you to get them back their job, Steve and the Quintet.
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
Talk to her, Sidney...
I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town.
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
I don't think so.
You're sure.  Find out for me.
Is Frank D'Angelo around?
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
In his apartment -
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
Do you still keep your key under the mat?
Don't you know who that man is?
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
What sort of thing?
What would you think of me if -
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
That's the third time he's called today.
But...
The renting agent and the tailor.
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
If that's for me, tear it up!
What's the matter?
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...
That's no way to talk...
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
Where's those glossy prints you promised?  Tonight's the latest I can place them -
Why me...?
Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous!
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?
We stick in each others craw.
Where do you come off to make a remark like that?
J.J., if you think -
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!
You haven't told him yet...
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
I made you write a beautiful song...
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
Do you know about the chip?
My God.
No good.
My mission is to protect you.
So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you?
What does that mean?
Liquid metal.
Can I stop by my house?
You sure?
Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
Oww!  Why'd you do that?
You have to do what I say?!
That is one of my mission parameters.
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
Swear.
Everything.
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean.
Alriight!!  My man!
She intends to change the future somehow.
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
This is tactically dangerous.
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
I'll deal with the police.
Remember what I said, you can't...
Drive for a minute.
We don't have much time.
Is it dead?
Will it melt in there?
No!
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
I have to go away, John.
It must end here... or I am the future.
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
Easy money!
Out of the way, John!
No!  Don't kill him!
It, John.  Not him.  It.
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
I love you, John.  I always have.
I got it.  Piece of cake.
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
I love you.  I always will.
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
Can it be destroyed?
You look like handmade shit.
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
The CPU from the first terminator.
I must be destroyed.
It's finally over.
Are you afraid?
Where do you stand on all this?
On all what?
On Furtwngler.
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
Respect your elders and your betters!
And no elbows on the table!
What does he mean, too correct?
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.
I'm very sorry.
I guess you admire musicians.
I guess it's possible.
So, what does the Russki want?
Yes.
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
You bet.
What?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
Furtwngler's in a different category.
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
Let Furtwngler go. Please.
You live here, in Berlin?
Yes.
You do shorthand and typing?
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
No. Ours was damaged.
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
What is this, Emmi?
I can't do this. It's not right.
I made no deal!
I don't buy that.
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
May I ask a question?
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
How?
I was warned.
Who warned you?
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
If it's too hot, open your tie.
I wish to say something.
And what was that?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
Tell me about von der Null.
Von der Null?
Yes, von der Null.
And what happened to Von der Nul?
I have illegitimate children.
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Do you know what that is?
Okay, so what is it?
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
That's what I asked.
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
Major.
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
It's Dr. Furtwngler's baton, which I stole.
Yes, you remember.
Show me.
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
I've remembered something else...
He did?
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.
And ask him about his private life.
I don't know what you mean, Major.
You were in insurance before the war.
Right. Claims assessor.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
Yes, Chuck?
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.
Alright!
Can you handle it?
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
You can't to that...
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
What do you think?
Great.
Alright, the beige one.
I hate the beige one.
Not lately.  Did you check messages?
What's it to ya?
You must have a girlfriend.
That's none of your business.
Do you understand?
This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
There's so much...
You cold?
Freezing.
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
I caught one, back there.
We gotta get you to a doctor.
John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...
I volunteered.
Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's better tight.
Good field-dressing.
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
Okay.  Talk some more.
About what?
Bag some Z's?
Thanks a lot.
That's where we're going.
Let's go.  Time to move out.
My whole life has been combat.
He'll find us, won't he?
Someone?
A girl.  You know.
So much pain.
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
And so you feel nothing.
It's better that way.
I bet you're ticklish.
What are you doing?
I don't think I like this.
What are you doing?
So.  You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Surrounded by living tissue.
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
I can help you...
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
That stuff's two hours cold.
Did you reach the next girl yet?
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
Call her.
I just called.
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
Go!  Go!  He's got her.
Projections were far too optimistic.
But, the expectation was ten.  And, in this case, expectation is everything.
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
You don't talk to me like that.
I apologized, I offered to help.
Pardon me... Miss... ?
Excuse me, I need to explain...
What's with him?
Do you know what to do?
Don't just stand there, get help!
Alright... okay...
This is nuts.
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
You've got to be kidding.
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
There's got to be a flashlight.
See you around.
Where are you going?
Don't even think about it.
I'll give you a boost.
No.
There's a ladder here.
This is C.R.S.
What's C.R.S.?
They'll love that.
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
You're the one who started running.
There goes a thousand dollars.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
That one did.
Never did catch your name.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
That's classic.
Where are we going?
What exactly do you do?
Nice.
The maitre d' called you Christine.
Right.  Call me Christy.
What are you doing here?
Can we talk?
What is it?
Well... the red bra.
Okay.
Do you mind if I sit?
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
Want anything to drink?
Take the picture out.
They're watching.
Wha... ?
No!  I'm sick of this...
What is this!?
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
What did you say?
My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
It might be best if we didn't talk.
All I mean is... someone like you...
What?
Scams, con games.  How many?
Who is it?
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
What... what do you mean?
I'm back from the dead.
Get us out of here...
Nicholas...
Who's responsible?!
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
Where'd you get that... ?
What the fuck are you... ?
Where'd you get that gun?
It's mine...
We searched the house.
Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
Stop talking...
Nicholas...
Shut up!
No!  You take another step, I'll shoot!  They're trying to kill me...
Stop it!
Don't move, you bitch... !
I have to show you...
Claire.
I have to get to the airport...
What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Like... where are you from?
Originally, Connecticut.
Big family... small?
One brother, one sister.
Studied acting, I assume?
Julliard, yeah.
Single?
Yes.
No.
Underwear?
Hey there, Nickie.
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
They gave me a free jacket at the door.
Never better.
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
Yeah.
You need anything?
For you.
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
Trust me.  Call that number.
This isn't an escort service?
It's a profound life experience.
Like a stroke?
Will you?
But, will you?
Are you still on mediction?
I'll call them, okay?
It doesn't matter...
I'm going to call.
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
What's this all about, Connie?
What are you doing?
Yeah, almost...
You dodged a bullet.
What have they been doing to you?
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
It's them.  They did this.
How did those... ?
You're part of it...
No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
Yeah.
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
Robbed?
I'll explain someday.
I'll call.  I really will.
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
Oh... it's a game.
What kind of vacation?
It's different every time.
Humor me with specifics.
We provide whatever's lacking.
How long will these take?
Get rid of them.
I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.
Goddamnit, why do they do that?
How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.
They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
You don't need me...
Where'd you pick up your checks?
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
Ah, Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go...
The key?
Hm?
Is there a room key?
Didn't I give you two?
Thank you.
Dinner's in the oven.
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
Is everything alright?
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
Mr. Van Orton... ?
Ilsa... you're alright?
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
What makes you ask?
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Not much, I think.
Did you worry about him?
Goodnight.  See you home.
Your brother.  Will you come with me?
Invitations: the Museum Gala.
No.
What gentleman, Maria?
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
Attractive...
Don't ask.
What's happened...
How concerned should I be?
He hasn't called back.
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
Uh... Nell Vance...
And what kind of sleeper?
I only saw Theo drive up.
The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.
Why?
Do we still get paid for the week?
It's not going to hold your weight.
Hey!  I heard screaming...
I didn't do it.
We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
All night?
You want company?
Was sure she'd be in here.
Are you working with her?
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
You don't believe in the paranormal.
No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
No.
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
Eleanor, how was the drive?
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
Nell!  What's wrong?
What did it smell like?
It was very specific.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
Like she smelled it too?
And then what happened?
I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
I don't know.
It was.
Someone is playing with you.
Why?
The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me.
But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!
Come on.
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
That?  That's Hill House.
Have either of you seen David Watts?
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
Maybe they're Mary's.
Oh God, we can't get out!
What do you want?
Oh!  You scared me.
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Is there something about the house?
That's where she hanged herself.
Why?
Why'd she kill herself?
Yes.
She was unhappy.
Mrs. Dudley.
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
What did it cost?
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
That's why we're here.
Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
Jeez.
A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.
Yes.  I've missed it.
Good night, Theo.
Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
How could he have left without his keys?
Watts?
What's his first name?
Is it over?
Theo... Did you?
Maybe you did it yourself.
I don't know what to think anymore.
Well?
I think so.
I don't think I want any.
What'd you come back for, babe?
Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.
I used to hate it.  Now I like it.
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
Not for you, clearly.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
Am I a thing?
Well, you're certainly not a person.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
It's not a knock.
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
As soon as you get dressed.
What kind of food?
Anything but Japanese.
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
Italian?
I'm sorry.
I like the colors.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
No.
Why not?
Hey.
How they goin', kid?
Same as last time -- the rest after.
Where do we go?
What.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
You broke last time.
I wouldn't talk.
Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
You're in gun country now, my friend.
Man knows what he likes.
Edward Rama?
Eduardo.  Rama.
I didn't expect anyone.
Who done it, then?
Huh?
Boomerang.
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
No.  Not at all.  Do we?
Five years, I think.  Long time.
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
What?
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
That was one of them?
What's so fucking funny?
Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
No one else is even here yet.
What are we standing on?
You goin' back inside?
That would be too easy.
I've been wondering something.
What d'you say, Elaine?
Not much -- you?
Same.
Really.
Didn't get it.
You just cooking then?
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
Had a feeling it was you.
You look alike.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Why did you come here?
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
Sort a few things out.
Been busy, have you.
How d'you mean?
That's not what I heard.
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
Oh, it just ended, then.
Not embarrassed.
Disappointed.
In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
When did you get in?
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
Nah, accommodation address.
What's that, like a P.O. box.
Something like that, yeah.
-- Your employer?
-- Mr. Lindgren.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
My employer.
What line is he in.
I bet.
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
Why not.
You don't believe it was a car accident.
Depends, don' it.
On what.  What makes you so certain.
I'll bloody well ask him.
How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
It didn't discourage you, though.
Hey?
I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
Who remembers.
Get seven years, did you?
Overnight.  What about just now?
You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
You ever been to London?
Only in the movies.
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
Not that I recall.
What'd your father do?
I guess you're just habitual.
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
How do you know?
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
It was you.  Downtown.
All of what?
Of the deal, man.
As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
And that is?
My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
Where is he now?
Don't you work with Ian?
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
I would have preferred staying home, me.
You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
Been away a lot.
Sounds like you need a rest.
How much.
Five thousand.
Hey.
I got half.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Yeah.
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
I don't know.
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
She's nice lookin'.
I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
What d'you mean, any happier?
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
There is?
Something's on.
You do?
You bet.
What's in it?
How'd you get in here.
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
So why would he want to see you.
Is Valentine here?
Hello there.
What are you doing here?
Exercising my visitation rights.
Since when?
You've made it ... brighter.
I don't want you here, Terry.
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
-- You know his name is Frank.
Is he here?
In a couple of days this whole thing --
Who's looking for you?
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
Ah.
You must know Ian.
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
Thanks.  You, too.
Tell me.
Hello, Ed.
...I'm so sorry about your loss.
Yes, Ann?
Yeah.
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
...I stank, didn't I?
He didn't say that.
But more or less.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
Huh.
You're an enthusiast.
Birdy--
...No, please.
Uh-huh.
Ah yes, a music lover.
...Mm.
...she can go up there.
You got the dough?!
I can get it, yeah.
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
...Was that a pass?
Maybe.
No problem!
Way out of line.
Right! Strictly business.
...You bring a check?
Cash.
That'll be fine.
Mm.
She's a rare one.
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
...Ed, I...
Well, you know what that would do to me.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
Please, Ed.
But it's...
Your place?
...Dave?
What kind of man *are* you?
Rye.
Told what?
Honey?
Come on, get ready. It's important.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
...What a knucklehead.
Who?
Dave.
...What's so damn strange about that?
Honey.
I don't know what's going on. I--
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
Should I... should I tell you why?
OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* killed him. How come?
OK, how did you know?
Will anyone else say they knew?
I don't know. I don't think so.
How did you get into the store?
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
Oh, hell. Drink?
No thanks.
Sure you don't need one?
I'm fine.
OK. Boy. Jesus!
So--
Taking it seriously.
Coffee, Ed?
I'm fine. Thanks.
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
Ed, how're you holding up?
I don't work here. My wife does.
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
Uh-huh.
...Ed?
Huh?
Russians exploded an A-bomb.
Yeah.
...You sure, Eddie?
Frank.
Huh?
This hair.
Yeah.
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
...How you today, Ed?
OK.
You don't got a headache?
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
That's very generous.
...We goin'?
Birdy... I didn't mean to--
What'd he say?
'Lo, Ed.
Mr...?
...You're Ed Crane?
Hello!
OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
Yes, sir.
He's a barber.
Ah.
Second chair.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
His eyes are open.
You'll go to the prison hospital.
What'd he say? Does he understand?
Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
Someone broke into this room.
I'll go down and speak to him.
Where's the walk-in safe?
Behind you.
Forget it!
Battery's dead.  Shit.
Ippolito!  Get back here!
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
Who are you?  The undertaker?
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
The body?
What's left of it.
We need light in here, stat.
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
Lieutenant --
You're kidding.
How big is the sub-basement?
Apparently it's huge.
Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
Look.  It's some kind of letter.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
Dr. Green has to see you!
It's still back there!
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.
What's that?
What does it say?
Dr. John Whittlesley.
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
What are we talking about here?
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
Curious.  There's something missing.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
I'm not giving up.
Margo, these aren't seed pods.
What are they?
Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?
I'm coming with you.
Come back and get me.
Dr. Frock?
Something tried to get into this room!
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
What's that?
Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
You work here?
Yes, I do.
What do you do?
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
We're not supposed to go back there.
I don't want to go this way.
Quiet!
Big as a house.
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
They were yellow!
Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
They've got something.
Shut them up!
Stop!
Argo!  Hobbes!
Oh... my... God!
Jesus, what is this?
Oh no.  I smell it.
Margo, you haven't heard?
What?
Mbwun.
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
What kind of egg is it?
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
Is Dr. Frock safe!
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
You were going to be married.
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
What happened?
Where did you see it?
That's not what I saw.
Pendergast?  Are you all right?
You're not.  Where is it?
Gone.
That was D'Agosta.
The planetarium!
Hide quickly!
What is it doing?
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
I think... it means it's full.
Then it won't go after the others?
Help someone!
You smell that?
Just like John.  He won't listen.
I have to shoot.
I can't!
Where exactly?
<i>Fiji.</i>
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
Viti Levu.  For how many?
<i>A month.</i>
Why wouldn't I?
That's right.
Close up?
Why is he in the basement?
What's to see?
Give me a shot from Truman's ring.
What have we missed?
We're not watching the sea.
Why would we--
What music?
He doesn't care.
Welcome.
Amnesia.
A window onto the human condition?
Are we talking Emmies?
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
Who are you?
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
The memory of who?
How can they have a child?
You think she'd go through with it?
Sure she would.
You take Japanese.
Oh, yes.
Lauren, right?
That's right.  Lauren.
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
No.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
Well, what do you want to do?
It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.
I've got to talk to you.
Sorry, I'm way behind.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
I think I'm mixed up in something.
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
I told you I can't.
What're we doing here, Truman?
This is where it started.
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
What's that?
Well, what do you think?
I won't be late.
Where have you been?
I've been thinking--
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this now and then.  Come to bed.
What're you doing down here?
I know.
What did you want?
I made macaroni.
Come on, Truman.  Haven't you studied enough?
Good night, Mother.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
Arrah!
Oh, my God!
What do I do?
I don't know--
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
I won't be here Sunday.
--we need more charcoal.
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
Let's go now.
You hate gambling.
That's right.  I do, don't I?
So why do you want to go?
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
You blaming me for the traffic?
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
There's been an accident, Truman.
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
Truman, what about that sign?
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.
--What the hell are you talking about?!
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
Who were you talking to?!
Well, I made it through another night.
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
It looks so small.
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
When you get to Fiji?
You got it.
Is there any way around?
The whole area's being evacuated.
Well, thank you for your help.
They're coming.  Any minute.
They're going to stop me talking to you.
I don't understand.
How's it going, Truman?
See you tomorrow, Truman.
I think you better tell us.
We don't even know you.
Well, we're FBI agents.
Yup.
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
I need your clothes, Byers.
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
Working with?
This man's still alive.
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
We have a situation. The members are assembling.
Who?
You got some kind of business with him?
I'm looking for him.
You looking for him for some other reason?
We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
Have you examined them?
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
I know the name. Why?
Those people were already dead.
I think you're full of shit.
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
How can I reach you?
What?
I'm not sure. A virus --
-- You saw this experiment?
That would be my guess.
You told me you had answers.
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
I've been using you?!
You didn't know my father --
Mulder -- it's me --
Where are you, Scully?
I'm on the roof.
Did you find something?
No. I haven't.
Had you.
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
Scully...
Scully, I found the bomb.
Where are you, Mulder?
Scully, get somebody to open this door.
Something's not right...
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
I wake you?
No.
Are you drunk, Mulder?
Go home, Mulder. It's late.
Get dressed, Scully.
Mulder -- what are you doing?
According to this tag.
Why are you whispering?
What did you find?
Evidence of a massive infection.
What kind of infection?
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
And you've never seen anything like that?
This looks like new grass to you?
All the equipment is brand new.
I don't know, Mulder.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
Where would they be going?
You think they went left?
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
This virus -- it... 
Mulder --
What do you think it is?
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
Scully....?
What are you doing?
Where'd they go?
What? What's wrong?
I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
I have. I did. It's done.
What? What happened?
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
We've got to keep moving.
I can't go any farther.
On whose orders?
I don't know anything about that.
Well, call General McAddie.
I don't have his number.
-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
Agent Mulder --
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
How deep does this go?
Are we being watched?
What are you doing?
What happened to Kurtzweil?
Where's Scully?
I have answers for you.
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
Where is he?
What about you?
You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
Sing a song of sixpence...
A pocketful of rye...
Did we go sailing?
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
She adores you.
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
Miriam...
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
Sing a song of sixpence.
Nothing.
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
I'll be fine.
Is it cold in here?
...a pocketful of rye.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Damn him.
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
I don't need them anymore...
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
...give a kiss to Edward.
I realize that...
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
Edward Baines, I presume.  Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete.
The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
Agent Novak?
With Stargher I saw things...
Why'd you bring him here?
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
Then what is he?
Evil.
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
What happened?
What difference does it make...?
You're sure of that?
Wait...
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
Where the hell are we?
COME ON!
You sure about this?
Yep.  Eloped.
They're hungry.
Thank you.
No problem.
You liked him?
What now?
Mocky-Lock.
Already there.
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
Intravenous administration complete.
She changed the codes.
Instead of going into his mind...
When did he lapse into the coma?
Catherine!
Into Stargher.  Inside...
Nervous?
Prevacid.  For my stomach.
Any psychiatric medication?
What about narcotics?
Agent Novak.
Dr. Kent.
How's the patient.
Awaiting his arrival.
What about the cat?
Someone looking after her little girl?
I need it.
Now?
The dog's an albino.  He'd love an animal like that.
How is she?
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
You sure you want to go through with this?
Right here.
Next time, tell me, okay?
Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
Den leuten.
Give her some cigarettes.
Warscheinlich ist der murder.
Thank you.
You were awfully good.
Do you understand German?
But I could follow it fine. Perhaps Harry told you about me. My name's Holly Martins.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
No.
He has a little dog.
Yes.
He was Harry's driver?
I don't know. They didn't answer.
Anything really wrong with your papers?
They're forged.
Drink?
Who are you looking for now?
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
Can I hear you?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
Do I...
Gestern bein heurigen...
What's that?
Tell me about him.
...to steal my girl.
Oh, that was many years ago.
...and buried him.
Seemed like a good idea.
It's just what he used to say.
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
We're both in it, Harry.
Holly.
I'm so sorry.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
Let's go away.
What's the matter?
I wish I knew.
Wer ist da?
What happened to your hand?
A parrot...Let it go.
Have you seen Calloway?
...you know.
Harry.
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
Here, it will be cold on that train.
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
He's safe in the Russian zone.
How do you know?
Did he say anything about me - tell me?
His.
Oh, well.
Why are you lying?
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
Thank you.
Nichts danke. Kein.
...parents.
They're Harry's.
Do you know this man?
Joseph Harbin...
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
Must you take those?
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
Where?
Yes, of course.
...Austrian Police Headquarters.
Can you tell me whose...
My name is Calloway.
Martins.
You a friend of Lime's?
Yes.
Been here long?
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
See much of him before that?
Holly Martins.
I can't say that I have.
Him dying like that.
...to him.
What are you trying to say?
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.
Ever seen one?
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
Listen, Callaghan.
What the devil?
Getting around, Martins.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
Miss Schmidt.
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
A parrot bit me.
Well?
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.
So would I.
Bring him in.
...in the morning.
Well?...
This is where he vanished.
I see.
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Fifty yards right down there.
A girl of spirit.
Didn't I?
All right, Calloway. You win.
I said you win.
Win what?
What time is it?
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
Wait a minute - let me out.
Well, there's not much time.
Shall I go over there, sir?
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
Do you know his number?
...his number.
I'll look it up for you.
Come upstairs a moment.
I know a very good dentist.
No, a major, were you really?
Mr. Crabbin.
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Very popular, sir.
...leaving tomorrow, sir.
Listen...
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
Hmm.
You can help her.
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
Unwise, Holly...
And - Anna...
What do you want me to do?
You've got plenty of contacts.
As long as they can use you?
You told them, didn't you?
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
...this way.
Coffee.
It's wonderful how you keep the tension.
You really liked it?
...were of you.
...you know and all that.
...the best way one can, you know.
Not yet.
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
Dr. Winkel?
Martins.
Coming to the point, please.
Find out?
In great pain?
Speak English?
Coffin?
Excuse me!
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
Mr. Lime - yes.
You remember me? Upstairs...
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
Could he have been conscious?
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
...give evidence.
Kurtz.
The Roumanian?
Yes.
There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.
Yes, it is.
Funny?
That's all you meant?
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
No.
Joseph Harbin.
Third Man.
Mr. Martins...
...this time.
Should I make it all fact?
What's the purpose of your visit here?
Where are you staying?
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
Lime.  Harry Lime.
Excuse me.
Yes?
I'm Daffy.
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
I'll share something with you.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
Nice work.
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
I don't know - I'm American.
We think in miles, not kilometers.
So how many miles do you think it is?
Everyone ok?
We're ok.
Richard - I saw a fin!
What!
Big?
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
I'm sorry.
She is gone!
What about Moliere?
He tried to borrow money from us.
It's on an island that no one get to.
But he has been there, off course.
One kilometer
Two.
Bonsoir.
Did you sleep well?
So from there to there?
We swim.
Have you told someone?
I think so too.
Exactly.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
We lost our key.
They only kill them when they love them?
They don't have extermination camps.
Fucking Danny, man...
That's a movie, you moron.
What do you think you're doing?
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
What do you care?
I don't, but...
Yeah, but not on the letters.
Why the fuck not?
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
I don't care about money.
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
Disease? What disease?
Where'd you read all that stuff?
Why no silencer?
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
What's he care about?
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
Oh, really?
Bigger and better.
Who's Linda?
Why won't you talk to me?
When can I see you?
Your father??
Where'd you get this?
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
The sex is better.
Even though his dick is so big?
With you there's a tragic dimension.
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
Fuck that.
Don't curse in front of it.
You're learning the Hebrew really fast.
I told you, I'm good at this.
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
I don't know. I just want to try it.
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
You gotta get out of here.
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
That's a much easier game.
I thought there were people here....
Who's Eichmann?
What'd you say?
Why are you taking that?
An investment banking house.
More cultural than political.
That would be a catastrophic mistake.
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
And? WHat did you notice?
Notice? Like what...?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
I don't know. Is that right?
And Jewish men like to get it.
He has Israel.
Those aren't Jews.
Who? How would I know him?
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
So you're saying it's not true.
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
Listen to me....
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
What were you, following me?
How do you reconcile the two?
I always won.
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
To hear them read Torah.
I thought you hated Torah.
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
I can't help what I think.
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
A forty-five.
It was a nine millimeter.
Think about your father. Your sister.
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
I don't do that.
You do it on the inside....
No!
Lina Moebius. And you are...?
Daniel Balint.
Balint?
What part of Germany are you people from?
So what Jew would you kill first?
Do you feel you're making progress here?
How have things been going?
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
What is happening?
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
What about chicken?
Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
Steve...
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
They're not my people....
Tell it to Hitler.
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
What kids?...
I've got to get back to the --
Who told you that?
Who knows what that is?
Which was his room?
You could do it.
Which one were you aiming at?
Shut up. Fuck you....
Open it up.
This will be a different kind of device.
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
Oh, what is this shit?
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
Not too fast.
You said they didn't have night guards.
Who even knew?
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
Where?
It's not going to be fine. It's --
When do you want it to go off?
Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
You remember Miriam....
Who'd you kill?
How did you know they were Jews?
I can tell....
Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head.
You missed on purpose.
And what did you do?
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
It's Friday....
"Do chickens give milk?"
Who's this?
Dennis Leary.
Leary?
Howard Stern.
Adam Sandler.
Funny?
Not like Mr. Dorfmann.
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
So what?
We tested the new bomb.
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
Are you out of your mind?!
Do you think I...
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
He's shy, not like Enzo.
Yes.
Does he know?
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
Did you tell him?
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
What d'you mean?
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
Hello!
You know each other?
Yes.
Where did you two meet?
You forgot the Hula!
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
Congratulations, Enzo.
Well, good night, then...
The Mamma's there too.
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
Jacques!  Johana!
Checking out the competition.
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
What else is there?
You risk your life when you cross the street.
Because you'd laugh.
How do you know that?
... Not yet.
Don't.
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
Ten thousand.
Lira?
Roberto?  How long?
Have the car painted.
Then tell him to wax it too.
Enzo, wake up!
Where did you get that?
Is he here?
Plenty of women everywhere right?
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
It isn't lit yet.
The rules are the rules.
... What's your name again?
And... does the voice come back?
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
Yes, I know.
I dove 315 feet!
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
What room have you got?
People say that?
Not at all!
Enzo?
What?
Madame...
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
No.
Why?
... Everything.
Everything about what?
Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did you learn how to drive?
Here...  Here...
You still collect them?
You don't have that one, do you?
Can I come in?
Anybody can have a bad day!
Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!
You say that because you have the title!
No!  I would never cheat you.
You were right.
... Push me back in the water...
I can't.
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
A drink to warm up?
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
In the lake?
Please, have a seat.
No, no.  You'll like it.  It's superb.
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
You look adorable.
Thank you...
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
... No?
How can you tell it's a female?
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
Hello?
How are you?
I'm still here.
Then, tell me a story.
Hello?
... Not at all.
You sure?
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
And you?
I didn't dive.
What?
Jacques...?
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
You've got to tell me what happened?
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
Promise me one thing.
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
... Are you sure?
This is the hotel San Domenico?
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
Why don't you ask me?
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
Where are you from, Henrietta?
Well... here.
In my apartment?
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
Louis, we were French!
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
Well?
What?
How was your trip?
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
Way past it.
Does that have a hidden meaning?
What are they for?
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
Who... Who is that?
But... how is he going to breathe?
Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
Wait!  Professor...?
I'll go see how he's doing.
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
So why the long face?
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
So. Do you have a name?
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
That got annoying fairly quickly.
Want to get a drink?
What was that!?
Sorry. I'm better with men.
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
Esther!
Esther!
You two know each other?
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
Happy Hanukkah Tikva.
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
What's wrong with him?
A stereo type alarm system?
Hammer, you alright?
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
I wasn't too over the top?
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
My soninlaw. What do you think of him?
Good looking?
Mmmyes.
This is for "mama and the kids."
What about me?
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
Then what do you do?
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
Sure.
Where's that man?
Sure!
I don't know. I want to see Robles.
What do you want to see him for?
I want him to lock me up.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
What did they say before the bad card came up?
Don't look at it!
See you tomorrow -
Pedro is waiting for me, too.
Rosita  I have wondered -
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed - He'll come up with something.
I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
Hey  I'm over here.
Well, I'd best be off.
It's about the leopard.
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
That's right, of course.
You know Charlie How-Come?
Come to look around?
About Charlie's leopard?
Yes, but what sort of a man?
It was you, Galbraith!
No.
It was you.
It's better you don't know.
I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
You're too good to me.
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
Are you all right?
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
What did he have to do - look at the body?
I know. Funerals.
Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me 
Maybe I want to feel badly.
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
I got into a little crap game.
Eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways 
We stood here once before.
I hated you that day - you and your flip talk - with that little girl lying dead.
Aint nobody out there, Mister.
Will you please come with me?
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes majordomo. They are expecting you.
Good afternoon. De Moraess residence.
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
I work here, sir. Im here most of the time.
Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brothers death.
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
Can it be that easy?
I found this at your brothers.
You... You found that at Leons?
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.
The man who sold the boy to your brother.
Mr Lombard?
Have you got a pen?
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
Paul Lamont...?
Mr Lombard...
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
Black suits you.
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
What do you mean, No, Mrs De Moraes?
One just doesnt... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
I dont.
Good.
Is there anything to understand?
You splendid bastard...
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
And you still havent told me why you sent me after Friedman.
I didnt know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
Something like that.
Something like that?
Here we go again.
Where is that?
Simplify and damn.
Dont you believe in simplicity?
So you did talk about it, huh?
What do you suggest?
I dont know. Everyones dead...
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
Crow what?
May I ask where youre from, Mr Lamont?
Europe...  France. Im French but I live in London...  ... England.
Youre sure you wont sit down, Miss Stewart?
By your Austrian?
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
Thank you. But I think Ill go to bed. Its been a long day.
Friedmans dead... They killed him...
Were both thinking the same thing, right?
Damn it! You cant fucking walk away from this!
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.  This should cover what you lent me.
Why?
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
Yes... Good, good...
So, what are you looking for?
... Fine. Ill go for the safe place.
On the bed!
Where is the Austrian?
Yes. Friedmans the fuckin Austrian!
Whos the money man?
Ever seen him before?
Yeah... The Diplomat.
Where?
Where are we?
Finsbury Park. Were in Finsbury Park.
Where are the kids?
And who does Friedman work for?
How many of you scumbags are here?
B-Black...
Where is it?
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
You sure you passed on my message?
How are you, Jane?
I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
Shes pretty... See you, huh?
Carlos De Moraes?
Yes. How did...
I hope its not too significant.
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
I didnt mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
I presume you checked your sons apartment...
The 1,000 is on account.
10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
What happens now?
Vous tes Franais?
Problems?
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
No. In Hampstead... Why?
This car needs petrol.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Huh... Im sure thered be lots of takers.
What is?
Trying to say something, Martin?
Hyatt... Friedmans... at the Hyatt...
The Hyatt...? Whats that?
At what time will you be available?
Three oclock.
Five to three. Youre early.
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
Its wet. Will this do?
Wheres your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
Shut up! Wheres your wallet?
A private investigator... Youre not Austrian?
Do you know Leons parents names?
Who else knows about the boy?
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
The nineteenth... How come you didnt know?
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
Hows the boy doing?
Los Angeles?
Welcome to the club.
No shit... Well, Im afraid I cant help you.
I take it you dont know where he is, then?
What about his girlfriend?
Quest-ce que tu veux?
Cinq cents.
O est pass ton salon?
Alors?
Then why dont you reach him?
Okay, shitbag. Im only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Five seconds. Then you die.
Fuck...
Three...
The acid bath?
Huh! You turned him into a liability, didnt you know?
If he had, youd be dead.
So why didnt he?
Try again, and this time be polite.
When they realise Im missing...
Mossad?
Cost what?
Costliest!
Whats that? A word?
Very funny. Can I go on now?
That's a good idea, sire.
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
Of course I am, it's just that...
I would like some fresh straw.
Now?
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
Now?
He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
What did they say?
What's going on?!
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
Well...
I'll go.
Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
I don't know it.  I feel it.
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
But it is what I want.
Will you at least let me stay with you?
But... why... what's the point?
Do as I say!
I want to stay with you...
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
I -- I don't understand...
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
We have to press home the attack!
Sound the retreat...
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
I tried to.
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
Quite a few.
Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?
Why?
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
And when was that?
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
W-w-what are you doing?!
What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
Am I... am I dead?
Dead you're worthless, darling.
Where... where am I?
God defeated the English, not me.
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?
Quick -- hide in here...
Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!
But where are you going to be?
Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
In a village called Domremy.
How old are you?
Were you baptized?
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
Not long ago...
Yes.
What did it tell you?
Please... may I have it back...
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
He's feeling wonderful.
Thanks be to God.
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
But... her army's so small now...
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
... You look wonderful...
If there was, I didn't see it...
His face.
Does he have hair?
5,000 gold crowns.
8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
Yes... they were.
Good.  Where are the English?
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
Wait, wait...
The wind will be against us...
What's going on?
Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...
We need another ten minutes...
Well...?  Shall we go?
Not yet.
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
Yes.  We can pray.
This is no good!
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
But the bridge has been pulled down!
Clear?
Jeanne... we're not enough...
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Jeanne, look behind you.
Do you know how to count?
Who told you to wear men's clothes?
Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
Stop it!  What are you doing?
Why not?  He has good teeth...
Yeah...
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
Prepare these as battering-rams!
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
Yes... a half-steed... white.
Who gave you that horse?
My king.
How many did he give you?
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
Jeanne... what are you doing?
What have you done to me?
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
What are you doing out here?
I might ask you the same question.
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
Yes!
They're going to come and visit you in here?
Why not?
They won't come anyway.
What do you mean, they won't come?
God asked you to do something?
Yes... lots of things!
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
No.  That was a sword in a field.
I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
What are you doing on the wall?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
I don't think so.
Are you going to leave me too?
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
You think you are ready now?
Yes, my lord.
I need to confess.
But you already confessed this morning...
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
My father's.
Oh yes... very.
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
So... everything sounds... wonderful?
Yes, it is.
Who is this "he"?
He never says his name.
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
Why did she have to die?
Jeanne, be patient.
I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
Someone you know?
You can't, it's too dangerous.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
Wladek, please.
Wladyslaw Szpilman.
Dorota.
I need help.
He'll be back before curfew.
How long have you been married?
And how's Yurek?
Will I still be able to play?
It's not going to be very comfortable.
I'm on the run!
Have you seen this?
Calm down, what, what is it?
Halina?
What?
What?
wish I knew you better.
Henryk's in there.
I haven't seen him.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
Can you help us?
It costs.
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
We're recruiting.
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
Mama, that was a great dinner.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
That makes a change.
A good place for what?  He's insane!
You sell anything?
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
I can look after myself!
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
Otherwise what?
No one thought they'd hold out so long.
So, what's the news?
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
Why didn't you come to me?
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
Can you help? I've no money...
Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
Wladek! How are you?
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
Pig!
Cow!
Pig!
Bitch!
Dirty pig!
You're a dirty pig!
I was listening, Kitten.
Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
Where are we going?
Out of Warsaw.
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
What the hell are you doing?
What's your work?
I am... I was a pianist.
Where are you hiding?
In the attic.
Are the Russians here?
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
Watch your feet!
Careful! Watch his hand.
To be deaf?
Yes, like a cave.
No sound at all?
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
My REAL father was a famous German composer
I thought she met your father in Luxemburg.
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
The Alps.
Well, that is a strong opinion.
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
She looks tired.
What's he say?
They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?
On your property?
I'd like to make a swap.
What for?
You'd have to organise it up here.
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
I don't want to learn.
You don't want to learn.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
You mean in signs?
No, words. You have never heard words?
Please take us to the beach where we landed.
You have to wash them.
She wants to see what you can do.
Everyone has to practice.
She says, throw the piano overboard.
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
What's in here then, lead?
It's my mother's piano.
Oh no, it can't come now.
Hello, then.
You've missed this bit.
Do I know any gigs?
You the owner here?
That's right.
All right if I look around your lobby?
Which way are the rooms?
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
What's the line on Visitation?
7 to 2.  That ain't bad.
The wallet.  You gotta go after him. He's got all the money.
You wanted by the law or somethin'?
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'. 
How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
What do we do?
No.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
You're late.  Where you been?
How much did ya lose?
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
You think my play is bad?
I'm out, Johnny.
If that's the way you want it.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
Wasn't no problem a mine.
Which way did he do, Eirie?
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
Which one?
What about the other one?
Who's got the contract?
Yes sir.
I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.
I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.
Been a while since I stocked a wire store.  Not many mobs playing that anymore.
You sober?
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw.
You mean you blew it.
I picked something up on the way.
Lonnegan after you, too?
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
I'll take him anyway.
You just worry about your end, kid.
How'd ya do?
Everything go all right?
No signs of trouble?
And?
You think he'll show?
Did he say he wouldn't?
No.
Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
Henry.
You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
You wanta wait for your share?
The wire is ten years outa date.
He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie.  How much cash we got?
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
Raise 500.
See and raise five.
Raise 300.
Raise 1,000.
See and raise 1,000.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
Who are you?
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
It isn't any better.
2:00 A.M.
You doin' anything tonight?
What does this guy want?
Looks like he missed ya.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
You sure it'll be one of these two?
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
Hooker!
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
I feel lucky tonight.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
Yeh, he knows that.
So could Shaw.
You're dreamin', kid.
660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
You should always look to the back too, kid.
And you were gonna pay me back?
You really picked a winner, kid.
Well, what did I tell ya?
You're a lucky man, all right.
Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.
You stayin' in or not?
You got the 400 grand yet?
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
Let me talk to him.
How am I gonna do that?
Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?
We missed him.
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
I don't know.  He took it hard.
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
He'll never do it.
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
What about this Rosebreen?
He was?
Why not?
You know how they are... sex...
Then just say he was sixty years old.
Is that what it means?
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
Now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.
Any luck?
Why did that man want to kill him?
Said he stole his invention.
What?
Nothing.
How are you?
Another young man.
That is, if it's all right with you.
Mind if I look around?
And don't ever try to see me again.
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
You're talking like a crazy person,
Give it to me.
What is it?
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
Don't.  It's horrible.
I didn't.
You hand that over to the police.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
Oh!
Mother!
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.
Is your father still in there?
He didn't do it -- Nick!
You know, we know each other.
Aren't you Nick Charles?
Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He worked on a case for father.
Macaulay.
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
tried him once -
How do you do?  I'm sorry we have to rush.
Come on in.
You heard about Julia Wolf?
Yes.
Where did you hit her?
She fell down.
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
Which way did she fall?
Where did you get this gun?
I bought it in a pawn shop.
Don't lie to me.
It's been the same one for three months.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
What would your mother say to that?
He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
How's your brother?
I'd like to see him.  Why don't you bring him down?
I know -- I know --
And he still wants to marry me!
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
Only in bad weather.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Better get home before it is.
You can take that out to the car.
Not at all.
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
Not a thing.
Did you kill her?
Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
What's he want of you?
What'd he think it was to you?
Ask him.  I don't know.
I'm asking you.
This gun yours?
No.
No proof?
No.
He's holding out on you.
Well, what'd you think?
I think we're on the right track.
Trail him!  Trail who?
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
Rosebreen.
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
What're you doing here?
Are you kidding?
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
You mean that body-----?
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
I said he hadn't written me.
Well, what?
He telephoned me today.
When was that?
About three.
Did you go?
I didn't know they had a fight.
Goodbye.
You did!
That's ridiculous.
I think we may as well sit down.
Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.
That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
Want to take a poke at him?
I'll get some.
You've said that for weeks.
Chris!
All right.  All right.
I couldn't go near that woman.
What are you going to do?
Just what I said I'd do.
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
Why, you said...
We're just having a little drink.
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
You're going to return every cent of it!
I can't! I haven't got it!
What did you do with the rest?
Oh, he's sitting up.
I'm not telling anyone.
But suppose some business comes up...
One hundred...  two hundred... three...
Thanks, and goodbye.
What'll I do if something comes up?
Is Julia going with you?
But what if you need more money?
How are you?
Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
I have no right to answer that.
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Well, don't you?
Dorothy!  Is she here?
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
They'll want more than your word for that.
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
Nobody told me.  I did see him!
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
I've never heard about you.
I didn't knock Julia off.
What's that?
Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?
Why do you say that?
So it's you he was after!
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
You might have mentioned me first.
Pretty girl.
If you like 'em like that.
Much better, thanks.
How many drinks have you had?
What hit me?
Who's that?
Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.
Isn't that my drink?
What are you drinking?
She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.
She didn't tell me a thing.
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
Can't you get to sleep?
Maybe a drink would help you.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
They were kidding you.
I'd like to see you work.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
But it's Christmas now.
You idiot!  Asta! Stop that!  Get down!  Now, stay there.
It's all right.  It just grazed me.
Someone get a doctor.
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
Want a drink?
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
I never saw that before.
No.  It's a Christmas present.
Who gave it to you?
Hello... send him up.
Who's that?
Aren't you hot in that?
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Is that another Christmas present?
Let's see.  Where's it from?
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Your guess is as good as mine.
Oh, it's a fire hydrant.
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!
You talk as if I were Asta.
What's the trouble, Asta?  Your balloon busted?  So's mine.
Maybe I will.
But Wynant --- ?
I don't believe he did it.
So am I.
He's just been for a walk.
Looks like a hold-up!
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
You bet I wouldn't.
Not with all your money!
You dog!
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
I did find him!
What do you mean?
It was his body that was buried there.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
That's a fact.
Well, don't they?
How long has he been dead?
Couple of months anyway.
Smart gal.
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
I'm going to tell her.
Yes!
Got a nice evening dress?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Got a nice evening dress?
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations. 
Mimi...
Mimi!
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
I wish you'd tell me who.
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
Is that true?
I don't know.
Why are you saying it?
It's the only way it makes sense.
No, Mr. Charles.
Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
Yes.  Nick!
You his wife?
Bonds, sir?
I know I left them there.
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
I'm sorry...  but...
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
Where are you going?
Home!
I'm fired.
Who fired you?
Baghdad.
What's in the other direction?
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
Paper.
It's a map, I think that's what it is.
Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.
What are we going to do!?
Wha...
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
What are you doing.
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
We've got rope?
Ready?
All right.  Let's get out of here.
The US Army:  Always an adventure.
What do you figure it to be?
Missile!
What about the gold?
What about it?
You're the one with all the ideas.
You don't know that.
You're out of your mind.
He's an enemy soldier.
We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority--
I've got no stomach for murder.
Then step aside.
No.
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
I'm the one's got the big stick.
Just keep quiet.
So you can give us away?
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
There might be something in there.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
Now this is war.
But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.
Invest it.
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
Take the binoculars.
Wh-what do you think--
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
They're not going to--
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
It'd make their heads explode.
What do we do with the Humvee?
SAY IT!
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
What!?
What?
You didn't step on any mine.
Oh, God!  Oh God!
Just be cool.
It's a mine, isn't it?
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
Why you got to move away to talk!?
There's a way.
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
This.  Whatever it is.
I don't hear any--
Don't!
Iraqis.  A bunch of them.
X marks the spot.
Where is it?  Where'd it go?
Stay low.
We're not going to do anything.
They're going to kill us!
A whole lot of nothing.
What are you doing?
It's just a mongoose.
Is it dead?
It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
We'll find our way.
How!?
Wes is dead!
What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
We'll lie.
First Wes, now you?
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
I'm sorry about that, Epps.
Epps?
Yeah.
I don't want to die.
I pick that way.
It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
Just let me rest for a second.
Well?
Slip out your M-16.
And then what?
Can't you--
What do you make of them?
Shi'ites, I think.
Is that good, or bad?
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
With what?  Against how many?
I didn't say that.  I never said--
Which way do we go!?
Damn it.  We lost the horses.
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
Epps.
Epps?
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.
He's not slowing.
Woods.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
Just...want to be ready when we do.
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.
Spanish wasn't hard enough?
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
What is this?
He says it's a box.
You get it yet?
Naw, nothing.
Jaeger?
Yeah.  So?
That's in two days.
Jaeger?
What!?
You ever think about dying?
Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
Epps, is that a sand dune.
If!  If there's a treasure.
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
If there's gold.  If!
Iraqis.
I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
I thought we were dead.
Yeah, well, we're not.
You have to go with us, Wes.
Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
How long we going to keep this up.
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
Is there anything you do know?
So?
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
What do you think?
It's got a bottom.
You down?
Maybe we should give him some water.
All last night he could have been--
I think he wants something to drink.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
Stress category.
Correct.  Origin?
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
Drug evasion with....
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
Permant cortex bond.
HUMMMM.....
Hurry up.
4732...?
Vocasity
What's this?  Why did you change it?
You've seen enough.
You know I don't feel well.
When?
Now.
Don't go.
I haven't done anything.
Look, food!
That's not food.  Can't be food.
What time is it?
Don't take anything.
What are you doing?
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
Are you all right?
They don't know.
They're watching us now.
It's the end.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
THX!
We're leaving.
What?
We're leaving.
Who?  Who's leaving?
THX and me.
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
I can't see him at all.  He's been destroyed.
How far did you go?  Was it cold?
I've got it!  Astounding!
Where is LUH?
Why did you have LUH come here?
I want you for my roommate.
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
When?.....How?
Right now.
What?
What are you doing here?
I was lost.
...and you're not lost now?
How do you know?
We've lost SEN!
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.
Who?  Me?...I don't know.
What kind of answer is that?
Oh, That!  I'm 5555 SRT Entron..
Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.
I knew him.
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
That's not it.
She's not there
No......  She's dead THX........
Remember this...?
Where's LUH?
No...no you're wrong.
I'm sorry.
What do you want?
Just look at all those people.
Yes.
May I help you?
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
They're not here.
Where are they?
And you are...?
Hey, that's the guy-
Coffee, Mike?
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
Aren't you on suspension?
Just do it.
Who the heck're you?
Where did you get this?
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
Treat. We treat devices.
Anything else I should know?
Only once, at Redstone.
Oh yeah? Prove it.
So what were they doing here?
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
Look, it's a longshot...
How long are we going to stay?
How long were you hooked?
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
Ex-girlfriend?
What's up?
Driving in circles, waiting for-
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
Fuck factor?
Off the scale.
Talk to me. Let's assess.
Good, now the other side.
Nothing.
More metal... sharp edge...
Which one's which?
I don't know.
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
How the hell do you feel yellow?
What do you think?
It's from an IRA.
You got it.
Bev, you're the greatest...
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
C4, plastic explosive.
Computer device?
What do ay say?
Alright!
Jesus...
Thank you.
Then why tell me?
You okay?
Alex-
What is that?
What's the matter?
No... No more killing.
Alex, please.
Who are you calling, sis?
Alex, please-
Drop it.
What the hell was that?
Prints?
Nothing so far.
What about the ballistics report?
I'm filing charges against that mother-
He is!
How're you guys doing?
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
Pooch, can you move it?
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
Oh shit...
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
What was it this time?
You okay?
Mike...
It don't work-
Reilly, Vice. I-
Make an appointment.
Vice cop on a homicide?
Device.
T.J., what're you doing?
So what're we looking for?
Nice to be here.
I'll do it.
Sir...
What's this?
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
I promised her she'd be safe.
It's our only option.
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-
Yes.
And diamonds in the front.
Yes.
Diamonds all over.
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
With the compliments of Colet and Company!
The representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, M'sieu Filiba.
No!
What did you talk about?
About tonsils.
Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the feeling we have met somewhere before.
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
I wanted to say goodbye to you.
No.
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
Amsterdam?
No.
Constantinople?
No.
You've never been in Constantinople?
And harems ... ?
Umm.
No doubt about it--it's that secretary.
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
Nice suit.
Like it?
Smart. London, eh?
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
He's really not a bad fellow.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?
I would start with cocktails.
Yes, Baron.
And, waiter--you see that moon?
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
I want to see-- 
Yes, Baron.
And as for you, waiter--
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
I hope you find the figures correct.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
Two weeks and three days.
Um-hum!
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
I've got to see you.
But not now.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
Very well, m'sieu.
Otherwise I'll call the police
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
What do you mean?
You say I am a crook.
M'sieu ...
Monescu.
M'sieu Monescu!
Just as you say, Doctor.
Thank you, Major. 
Good day, Doctor.
Now just a minute, Major--
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
Disappointed?
The pepper, too?
Monescu!
Gaston Monescu.
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...
Right.
Sweetheart, what day is today?
We'll take the Royal Suite!
Two fifty-three, five--
What?
Certainly!
Five, seven, and nine--
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
What time is your rendezvous?
Now, Lily--
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
Lily, you must listen to me.
And you--
Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company! 
I remember.
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 
Oh! You didn't read it!
Naturally I did.
Too much blue in crimson.
What shade of powder do you use?
That's too dark.
What?
Make it out to cash!
Eighteenth century.
Right!
This used to be my secretary's room.
I see.  She must have been very happy here.
Then I mislay my checkbook--
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
The same thing.
I'll be delighted.
Um-hum ...
Then riding together.
Um-hum ...
Then lunch in the Bois--
Together.
Then a little nap--
Beautiful.
Hair?
Marvelous.
Correct!  Good night.
Good night. 
Good night.
Talk? About me--about us?
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
You would?
Yes, I would!
Like that!
And you're going to fall for them.
So you think you can get me?
Any minute I want!
You're conceited--
But attractive--
I <u>must</u> go.
I'm crazy about you!
I know it.
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
I <u>believe</u> you.
Then why do you want to go?
On the night table.
Thirty-three--
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
Call the police?
Instantly.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Mariette!
<u>Adolph</u>?
Adolph J. Giron.
And you expect me to believe that?
Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.
Goodbye...
Goodbye.
It could have been marvelous ...
Lovely.
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
Yes, Madame Colet?
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Oh, no, it's the way you lead.
No, m'sieu!
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
Two lumps, madame?
Please!  Thank you.
Well--uh--yes and no.
To me he seems rather nervous.
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
Yes, madame?
Ever had a romance with a crook?
He started it.
But you're the more intelligent one.
That's true.
Then why did you do it?
Because I hate him--because I love you!
Your bag?
Yes, my bag!
Didn't you take it with you?
No--I'm sorry.
But you saw it here.
Yes, I saw it--but--
How much time?
The ship will sink.
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
Good luck to you, Rose.
I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.
Who's the best? Say it.
We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here...
Holy shit.
Don't drop it Rose.
Rose Calvert.
None of the stewards have seen her.
The one on the other side is letting men in.
I make my own luck.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
My God... Cal. Is it a --
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
But I was with him the whole time.
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
Is this in any way unclear?
What do I tell your mother?
You're precious to me, Rose.
Sure. Count me in.
This should be amusing.
Just a soupcon of lemon...  ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
You're a good liar.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
Cor... look at that, would ya.
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
Why have we stopped?
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
How cold?
Ever been to Wisconsin?
I'm Jack Dawson.
Could I speak to you in private?
So, you got a name by the way?
Mr. Dawson, I --
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
Is he your boyfriend?
Yes, exactly!
So don't marry him.
If only it were that simple.
What's this?
Just some sketches.
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
No, no! Just with her hands.
And...?
May I cut in, miss?
I don't know the steps.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
Where to, Miss?
Are you nervous?
You're trembling.
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
You have to go for help.
I'll be right back.
Will this work?
You jump, I jump, right?
I promise.
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
You think she was really there?
Would you like anything?
It's been 84 years...
Don't come any closer.
My God, Rose, what's gotten into --
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
Rose, get in the boat!
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
Do you want the truth, Anya?
It would be a nice change from you.
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
Well--shall we go into dinner?
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
Good afternoon--
I hope so.
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
I don't understand.
Did you find it?
No-o!
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
What did you want a gun for?
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
Guess again, copper.
Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
How about a little game later?
I'm so sorry!
I thought you were one of my friends.
Nice lines--
Very much--
You've got lipstick all over you.
--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
So you washed it off!
How about giving me another coat?
Good-by!
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
Never eat before the show.
This is Mr.--er--
Brett is the name.
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
Isn't she attractive?
Very--your mother?
Don't be a c-a-t.
Yes?
Well, I can't.
Don't rub it in.
When?
At seven-thirty?
Sooner it you like.
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
A little.
Sorry.
What are you thinking?
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
You mean that?
Don't let's talk about it.
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
Good night, Mrs. Brett!
I could see you were pining away--
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
Nix, the law!
Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
How're the tips?
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Oh, Shortie!--  --there's a girl on this ship--
No, sir?
My change.
Shortie!--you know my motto?
Inspector McKinney.
Thank you, sir. 
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
About sixteen hundred.
You keep it-- 
<U>Me</U>!
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Where did you hide it?
On the drunk.
Come in! 
It's your deal.
How's your mother feeling?
Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
I thought you were a sucker--
Oh, yes. On the pier.
I'm going to the show--
Care to join us?
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
How about you?
Sure, I'll go.
I'll go with you.
Hello, young fellow!
Here's your fifty.
Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.
No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
That's too bad.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
Here you are, sir. 
Where do you live?
In New York.
Back is in New York.
Sure.
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
I'll say--how fast is this boat going?
Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
No. <U>Knots</U>!
What?
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
Yes--Me--in person!
I can see where I won't talk much to you.
Well, did you find me?
McKinney's the name.
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Is this your gun?
Everything O.K.?
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
I don't get the humor of that remark.
Yes.
Very serious?
Why--don't you like him?
Meaning what?
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
Somebody's got to do it--
What's the matter, Mary?
I'm getting seasick--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
With your dry wit and humor--
Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
What's he got that I haven't got?
--And he has sex appeal.
So what?
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
That's him! That's the sucker!!
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
How much did you lose?
About twelve hundred.
He's all right.
Thanks to me.
Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
Congratulations.
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
That's the truth--every single word!
I sincerely hope so--
Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
There you are, sir.
Thank you.
He's certainly good-natured.
Sure, Sis.
I was in his cabin--
What!--are you crazy?
Nothin'.
I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Then why did you run away?
I said that's 500 to you, Holliday.  In or out?
God damn son of a...
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?
Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-

Pretty fun too, isn't it?
Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.
Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
You'll never make that stick.
Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.
Virgil?
See what I mean about it getting Spooky?
Why don't you just leave it alone?
I appreciate your assistance, M. But this is now a military operation.
It's too late -
Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.
I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
...And what's that, my dear?
I'm sure they will.
- Instant melt-down.
...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.
Where can I find him?
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
- We all want what we can't have?
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there.
Paris?!? What are you doing here?
Is that any way to say hello?
Oh, James. I've missed you -
Is this another one of your games?
Do you feel better now?
Shhhhh...
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
It must do something.
How is old Q?
Gone fishing.
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
That's reassuring.
Hey - the world is my office.
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Natalya?
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
She married a hockey player.
I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -  What happened?
Who knows? Fog, night...
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
I got you covered.
Interesting presentation.
... Does this do anything?
Married?
Happily.
... Kids?
Three. You? Married?
No.
Thanks.  Take care -
Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
Nice to run into you again.
I hope you'll be gentle.
And what do you call this?
If I were you -
Why don't we just take these -
... Do you have a gun?
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
Blood or Dutch?
He was my father's best friend!
He's killed closer.
Wait here.
... How did you get into marine salvage?
Not a lot of difference.
What the hell does that do?
Down?
Sometimes you just have to -
If not?
Sleep well?
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
And when might that be?
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?
- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -
... What's Harmsway done?
...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
What do you make of all this?
... And what do you call these?
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
I was just getting to the interesting part!
Sakwa!
Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.
Who's in charge here?
What's your name?
No.
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
How is it now?
What is HE doing here?
Obviously, the British government denies all of this -
...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
How sweet.
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
Approaching the first gate.
Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!
Take the men. I can finish alone.
Is the helicopter ready?
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?
What the hell is going on?
It's Bond!
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
What about ID's?
Who is it?
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
I don't know. He's not in the database -
Will it go off?
Maybe. Maybe not.
Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.
I pay my own way.
What did your wife get her?
Junior spends time with his child.
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
What is a sip of coffee going to do?
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
Like a veil has been lifted?
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
Who is it?
I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.
Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?
What for?
I'm going back home with Harry.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
I could swear I heard my son call me.
You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
Well, you just have to move further out.
Now how far would further out be?
Your feet are cold.
I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.
You all act like two roosters.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
Hush.
You're always taking his side.
I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.
I'm worn out.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
It's good to be able to hear that.
You must have been really sick.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
What, are you having another party?
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
Since this morning.
What happened to your hand?
What did you put on it?
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
Everything these days is made overseas.
Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.
I have someone I want you to meet.
How is everybody?
Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
That smells like fresh coffee.
Let me get you a cup?
Good afternoon, ladies.
Those boys never did have good luck.
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
How many people do you all feed?
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Girl, do you still sing and dance?
Some people grow up and change their ways.
None of your business.
You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."
Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
Is this your house?
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.
No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
We can't really bring another family in here with us.
When did you talk to Harry?
What are you doing?
I was just trying to make conversation.
Where is Skip?
He is in his pigeon cage.
I'm sorry he got those birds.
I didn't mean for you to pay me for that.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
Wow!  Cool!
Whadda ya think?
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Can I bring some toys?
You can bring ONE toy...
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
But Mom, I can't find him!
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
Can I help pump the gas?
Yeah?!
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Next stop...
Mom, have you seen Woody?
Where was the last place you left him?
Everybody say, "Bye, house."
Hey!  Wow!
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
Which one can I open first?
We're almost there.
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Hello-o-o...
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
You can't!
Can!
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
You're mocking me, aren't you?
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
That's why.  Sid.
Sure is a hairy fellah.
Oh.  Oh, that's good.
According to my nava-computer, the --
Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
Ow!  Watch where you're going!
You mean it has hyperdrive?
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
Woody, we don't know what's out there!
It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Woody, stop it!!
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
Come on, this way!
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Shhhhhhh!
What?!
I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
Well, thanks for the ride.
Great!
Woody!  The rocket!
Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Hi!
Hey, watch it!
Let's string him up by his pull- string!
B-3.
Miss.  G-6.
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
Are you peeking?
No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!
Oh, that is disgusting.
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
I don't know!
Oh no, Hannah!
What?
Hey!!
She's sick!
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Aa-a-a-a-ah! 
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
A lunchbox?!
Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...
Who is it this time?
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
No!  No, no, no, no!
ROOAAAARR!!!
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.  This is serious!!
Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
What the heck is up there?
We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
I got it, Woody!
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
Sir!  No Sir!
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
This is ludicrous.
Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
W-w-w-we?
Hey, Slinky?
I'm red this time.
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
Bad news?!
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
Woody!  Speed up!
I can't hold on much longer!
You'll put your clothes here.
I can manage.
I like plaits.
I did like the music.
Is there anything else I should know about him?
He made that. In his off hours.
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
I want to go home.
Home is where the heart is.
She's not accustomed to being ignored.
She'll have to learn.
What was <i>that</i> in aid of?
Go away.
Do what?  Oh, I see.
You're only a young thing.
You're not so old yourself!
Who's there?
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?
I finished it off.
He'll murder you when he finds out.
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
Stop it!
Finn ...
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
How long has -
So had I.
Everything is gone, now.
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
I'm Melanie.
Did you do this?
You're well built; how old are you?
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
I... I don't really know.
Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want?
I can't find Manolo.
How much?
What is he planning on telling them?
I want to believe you.  I really do.
Helena, I'm so sorry --
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
How much do I pay him?
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.
Don't bother.
Carl, that's insane.
Carl --
That's frustrating.
I think she's lying.
Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
This is different.
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
Should we bring the police into this?
About the other night, I'm sorry.
My Leica's gone.
So's the video camera.
Did you meet the President?
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
Did you tell Dad?
Not yet.
Are you going to?
I don't know.
Is this bad for him?
Hi.
Hi.
Just watching you.
You all right?
What if every country legalized at the same time?
I don't know.
Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?
Okay, young lady, that's it.
You can't make me.
...How old are you?
Sixteen
Live with your parents?
Parents still together?
Yes.
In school?
Private?
Yeah.
How are your grades?
I'm third in my class.
What's that mean?
I get A's.  All A's.
What are you doing?
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
What is this, like freebase?
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
Have you done your homework, honey?
Yes, mom --
That's a big word for a fisherman.
I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
She knows Arnie Metzger.
So does half of San Diego.
You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona.
He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you.
What do we do?
What do you think she wants?
Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?
What do you think it is?
Depends who it's from.
Depends on the state.
David --
I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
Yes, sir!
We aren't barbarians.
I don't know, sir.
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
Wasn't that General Salazar?
Yeah.
What's he doing up here?
Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
Who?
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
Madrigal's alive.
Somewhere safe.
You should feel good about this.
What's your name?
If I can.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
What is it you want me to do?
Does this offer include my partner?
Only if he can be trusted.
I'm aware of that.
I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
She's not at that place you sent her?
Oh, man --
Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?
You won't say anything to my parents?
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
Salazar's been taken down.  He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.
Who are these guys?
Who do we interface with on their side?
Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
Did you tell him?
Well, I've not brought them.
I'm sorry.
Bit fucking late, like.
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
You've stabbed me, man.
For fuck's sake.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
What?
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.
Thanks.
What's your name?
Diane.
Where are you going, Diane?
Where's that?
It's where I live.
Great.
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
Diane.
Ssshh!
Sorry.
Right. You can't sleep here.
What?
Out.
Jesus.
Because it's illegal.
Holding hands?
Calm down. You're not going to jail.
Easy for you to say.
Can I see you again?
What do you want?
Are you clean?
Yes.
Is that a promise, then?
Smells like it.
You're too young.
It's Iggy Pop.
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
Sixteen next month.
So, what's he like?
I read it in Cosmopolitan.
What happened?
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
Oh, really?
Do you recall the school motto?
Of course, the motto, the motto --
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.
I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.
There's no need.
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
Are you getting out much?
No.
Following the game at all?
No.
You take the test?
Aye.
Clear?
Aye.
That's nice.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
Have you got any gear on you?
Good luck, Spud.
Cheers.
Now remember --
Right.
But try too hard --
Exactly.
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
Running time?
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
Director?
Lewis Gilbert.
Screenwriter?
Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.
OK, so who was it, then?
The park?
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
Who wrote it?
Roald Dahl.
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
What about The Untouchables?
I don't rate that at all.
Despite the Academy award?
Yeah.
That's your theory?
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?
Say something, Mark, say something --
Eughh. Sounds horrible.
It wasn't that bad.
Did he -- you know?
What?
No, he didn't make me touch it.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
He made me lick it.
Cut it out.
When are you going to visit him?
Why would I want to sell my passport?
What was your price?
Four Grand.
But you don't have the money?
We're two thousand short.
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
The Sick Boy method.
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
That's hardly a substitute.
you'll need one more hit.
No, I don't think so.
What's on the menu this evening?
Your favourite dish.
Excellent.
Your usual table, sir?
Sounds great, Swanney.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
There.
How's it going with Gail?
No joy yet.
How long is it?
Six weeks.
Where did she come up with that?
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
Six weeks and no sex?
So what's it going to be?
We go for a walk.
What?
Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
And how did you breach the Barrier?
Then I shall make use of this starship.
He has his doubts...
No, no, it's not possible.
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
Rescued at last.
My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
Sulu, what are you doing?
Following new course. Warp seven.
In firing position. Torpedo armed.
Shuttle en route.
Position, Bird of Prey?
Raise shields.
But the shuttle-
This is the Starship Enterprise.
I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.
Can we have it quiet?
Have the Klingons responded?
No, but you can bet they will.
Your pain runs deep.
What do you know of my pain?
Where did you get this power?
Join my quest.
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
And that is?
Because it's there.
Ah, Captain?
I don't understand.
What are you doing?
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
Jim.
Yes, Spock?
Go to sleep, Spock.
Yes, Captain.
Goodnight, Spock.
I could use a shower.
What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
I cannot be certain.
I do not often think of the past.
Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.
To land any closer would risk detection.
Spock.
Be one with the horse.
You must allow us to act.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
I ordered you to defend this ship.
You ordered me to kill my brother.
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
There, you see? See?
I have a half brother.
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
There's got to be a way out of this place.
Is it possible?
I am here, Captain.
New word. "b".. "a"... um...
There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
It would appear we are too heavy.
Spock.
...mark two.
Spock... don't.
What is this?
Spock?
Spock, I thought I was going to die.
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
Who are you?
We must change our course at once.
Spock...  What have you done to my friends?
Now learn something about yourself.
Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
You are mad!
About the ship...
The ship needs its Captain.
No special conditions?
What makes you think I won't turn us around?
What have I done?
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...






"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
Sybok, you must surrender.
No. I will not.
I hide no pain.
I know you better than that.
Spock?
I cannot go with you.
Why not?
I belong here.
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
Sybok, we must find a way...
I don't get it.
Hi, Alan.
Want one?
I want to go to his place.
You call that getting over it?
What for?
To warn him.
Of what?
For what?
I don't think I'm cleared for this.
Beautiful!
That all you can say?
Oh. Anything else?
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
I'm your program?
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
This town's full o' live ones.
Yes!
No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show...  What's up?
Flynn?
Cute.
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
Who is your User, program?
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
Where did you hear that name?
What's that?
Flynn!!
Greetings, program...
You're alive!
Did we make it?
Hey... you guys OK?
A User -- in our world?
There's another beam!
Flynn, we've got to help him!
Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
Flynn... you can't... I
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
You're a..."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
Watch it!
Feel what? You okay?
We have to talk.
So...how's the world of serious science?
you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
What do you think?
You think we can make it there?
Do you know what he's talking about?
My quarters.
Why is everything...like this?
You've grown, big program.
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
What is it?
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
We have to get off this beam!
Nice...
It's something Users do.
So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
I'm shocked.
Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
Where are you going?
Dana, are you listening to me?
How was school today?
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.
Harry!  Where are you!
Harry?  HARRY?!
What a team.  See you at eight.
Thanks dear.
Son of a bitch!
Kids.  Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.
Fourteen, Harry.
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.
There's another guy, still in the car.
You want me to just hang-- ?
Just hang a minute.
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
Is this national security stuff boring you?
Put a tap on her phone.
What're you talking about?  We have that.
Guy's a spook!
Give me the page.
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
She's still at my house.						*
You tell on me, I tell on you.
We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?
I thought this look like your work.
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
No!  Never!
So, it was your first time.
Well, what's the point of waiting?
Yes.
Oral hygiene?
Did you tell her about us, Harry?
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
I'm late.
That's fabulous Harry.
Uh huh.  Okay.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
I'm sorry.  Thank you for the party.
Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
Uh huh.
They must've just missed me.
Why did you continue to see him?
You weren't attracted to him at all?
Would you say he was boring, then?
Let me handle this part.  Do you mind?  Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
And you agreed?
Yes.
I don't know.  I guess I needed something...
Let me out of her!  Right now!
Yes.
Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
You will be contacted with the assignment.
Natasha?
Now slide the nylons off one by one.
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
What were you doing there?
What did he give you?
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
Yes.
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
I don't take those assignments.
What about Juno?
She's really a fox, isn't she?
Did you pork her Harry?
No.  But I wanted to.
What is it?
What?
Do you still love me?
As much as you used to?
What are you going to do?
So what's your angle?
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?
I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?
What?
Boris and Doris?
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.
Like one?
Tell me what happened?
I'm sorry, I can't.
I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
You'll call me then?
What is it you need me to do?
I don't know.  I have to think...
What do you want me to do?
His wife.
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.
Did you get the letter?
What letter?
Not yet.
That was so good I am gonna have another.
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.
I didn't get any chicken.
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
Tell him we gotta go.
The letter I sent.
Has he looked through it yet?
Bye-bye.
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
Want some Goobers?
Thanks a lot.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Is that your real name? Really?
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.
What time is it?
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
I love to get pie after a movie.
Would you like to get some pie?
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
How 'bout me what?
Tell me about yourself.
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
Ask me them again. One by one.
What do you do?
I don't remember.
What's your favorite movie star?
Like it?
Very much. Now, where were we?
How long have you worked here?
Almost four years.
You know when you sat behind me?
What would make you think that?
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
Who and what is a Drexl?
My pimp.
You have a pimp?
Uh-huh.
A real live pimp?
Uh-huh.
What?
Yes.
You better not be fucking teasing me.
Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"?
I do.
Hello, Mrs. Worley.
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
Where you goin', honey?
What?
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
What?
I think what you did...
What?
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
With a vengeance, I hated them.
Cancoon.
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -
So you do eat pussy!
What?
Can you live with it?
Yeah.
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
You'd really do that?
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
Where the fuck is that bitch?
She's with me.
Wannabee nigger...
You got it.
It's great to hear from you.
I'm a married man.
Clarence sent a letter?
Money problems?
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
This shit can't be real.
It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!
I certainly hope so.
Tell me.
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
Elliot.
Elliot what?
The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
Clarence...
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
Clarence.
Yeah?
In case.
I'd fuck Elvis.
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
Want an animal cracker?
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
What department?
What do you think, eightball?
Where's everybody else?
Well, I guess it's about that time.
Elliot.
Yeah?
Don't you?
Say it, goddamn it!
You are the dumbest person in the world.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
Where'd you go?
A Norms in Van Nuys.
Why does he trust you?
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
I can, but I don't.
Do you still have friends on the force?
What makes you think I could do that?
You were a cop.
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
Where'd you come from?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
That was very good.
Sure. No problem.
Could we try it now?
Where'd he come from?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
That Vietnam movie?
Uh-huh.
That was a good fuckin' movie.
Sure was.
Do you believe him?
He'll wear a wire?
You're no longer an extra -
'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -
You do more than try.
You do.
He knows.
How the fuck could he know?
He saw the wire.
How's he supposed to see the wire?
What was I sayin'?
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?
You gotta hold this for me.
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
Just put it in your purse.
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
I'm not wearing a bra.
Put it in your pants.
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Sorta room-mates?
Yes.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
Do you know where we can find him?
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Where's that?
What was the Jew-boy's name?
We want you to tell us about last night.
Well?
Him?  You saw that man?
He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out.
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
They forced me to take drugs.
Change what?
I need to go.
Do you know why you're here, James.
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
I have to go.
A jail?  Prison?
I love this air.  This is wonderful air.
What's wonderful about the air, James?
It's so clean.  No germs.
You're afraid of germs?
This is April, right?
July.
Do you know what year it is?
What year is it?
No, 1995 is the past.
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
It's just a shot to calm you.
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
"Never cry wolf!"
My notes.  Observations.  Clues.
They're keeping an eye on me.
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!
You didn't have a gun before, did you?
James, why don't we...?
Mason???
What's the matter with your leg?
You smell so good.
Give me the gun.
The gun! ... I lost it
I don't understand what we're doing.
I thought I was in...prison again.
Just like that?  You were in prison?
It was?  I didn't...know.
What does this mean to you?
You want me to rob him?
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.
What're you writing?  You a reporter?
What...???
Excuse me -- what did you say?
I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
How did you find me?
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
But you know what's real now?
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
You really want to know?
Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
You want to go in?  Examine him?
No, thank you.
Nine thirty
Might be tight.
Hey!  You there!
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
I think I've heard that before.
What do you want for free?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
More or less.
You want to make a kiddies bet?
Thirty-bucks?  That's it?
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
It's nonsense.
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
Can I help you, sir?
Where to?
Out of here.
Where in Mexico would you like--
How much.
One way, or round trip?
One way.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
You want somethin'?
You Harlin?
Nope.  Darrell.
Harlin around?
Will he be back soon?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
How much time?
Time.
What time is it now?
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Nothing.
Don't look like nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
How much!?
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Two-hundred.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Please, just leave the car alone.
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
It is morning.
I want my car.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
What would a truck stop be without beer?
Let me have a Beck's.
We ain't got no Beck's.
Ned!  Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.
Who was that on the phone?
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
What's the matter?
You didn't hear something?
How could I?  I was sleeping.
Jake, what is that?
What does it look like?
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
I'm just going to my car.
Do you have to call me that?
I don't know your real name.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
My cup runneth over, beauti--
It's Grace.
You sure you can manage?
No, I've got it.
What happened to your hand?
Accident.
Thank you, John.
You're welcome, Grace.
I just drove in this morning.
Where you coming from?
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
What happens if you lose?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Nice place you got here.
I guess it must.
Where'd you learn to do that?
A medicine man?
Those are white words, not ours.
What?
Like you.
Beautiful?
I have ideas.
You never did answer my question.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
You love him?
No.
I'm guessing no.
You could just leave him.
I don't know how.
How far is it to California?
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
Yeah.
Take me with you.
Where?
You live pretty good.
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
What are you talking about?
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
What about us?
I could if I had Jake's money.
Why the hell didn't you do anything?
Where's the safe?
Nothing.  There's no safe under here.
There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.
If you want.
Let's go in the bedroom.
Let's do it here.
Where are you going?
Sheriff Potter, please.  I can't go to jail.  I wanted no part of it.
Give him the money.
You heard me.  Count it out.
I shot him.
You killed him!
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
Well, nothing.
Are you all right?
I think I busted my leg.
I can't make it.  Grace?  Grace!?
John!  Can you hear me?  Are you still there?
Where the hell am I going to go?
It's . . . it's locked.
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
No.  I swear it.
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
Who the hell are you?
I'm her husband.
A lot that means.
What happened to your hand?
Accident.
You've got to be--
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
I'm a solid man.
John Stewart.
Wait a second--
Would you?
Would I what?
How do you know if you've never tried?
Good Lord.  What happened to you?
Hungry?
I had a problem getting my car back.
Now what can I do for you?
Talk?  About what?
About things.  About your wife.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
I'm not rambling.
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
You meant it.
And what does that make you?
And for that you'd kill Grace?
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
How much could you get?
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
I need thirteen.
Is the job done?
No.
You didn't kill her?
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?
You think that's a lot of money?
Yeah, well, me too.
Trouble with the car again?
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
There's another reason?  It better be good.
I came for Grace.
You came to take my wife from me?
I came to kill her.
It's the truth, Jake.
Honest, Toby.  I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.
I want to stay.
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?
What happened to your hand?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
I've had time to get over it.
For what?
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
What the hell are you talking about?
Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Christ, I don't believe this.
Stand up.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Mister!
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
Now, what's this?
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
Do you understand me you little fuck?
Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
Why don't you step out of the car, son?
I don't understand what the--
Eh?
Soda.  You got any soda?
I call the policia.
No police.
But, Senor--
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
Senor, you need a doctor.
Hey!  You there!
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
I think I've heard that before.
What do you want for free?
What?
...But ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
More or less.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
Christ, I don't believe this!
Stand up.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Mister!
Now, what's this?
Give it to me!
Who the hell is this!?
Who the hell are you?
A lot that means.
You broke my nose!
Accident.
You've got to be--
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
That's a solid name.
I'm a solid man.
An overheated car.
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
California...
Wait a second--
Would you?
Would I what?
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
What can I do for you, lad?
I was hoping we could talk.
Talk?  About what?
About things.  About your wife.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
I'm not rambling.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
You meant it.
How much could you get?
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
I need thirteen.
I guess this is what they call "ironee"? Hunh?
I came for Grace.
Shhh! Liar.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
I've had time to get over it.
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
For what?
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
What the hell are you talking about?
You Harlin?
Nope.  Darrell.
Harlin around?
Will he be back soon?
You own this place?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Yeah, I can fix it.
How much time?
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
How much!?
Hundred-fifty.
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Two-hundred.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Look, Harlin.
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
What you want?
I want my car.
That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Got any cold soda?
Eh?
Soda.  You got any soda?
I call the sheriff.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
I'm just going to my car?
I don't know your real name.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
I like that about me, beautiful.
It's Grace.
Jesus.
You sure you can manage?
No, I've got it.
What happened to your hand?
Accident.
Thank you, Bobby.
You're welcome, Grace.
I just drove in this morning.
Where you coming from?
What happens when you lose?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Nice place.
I guess it must.
Where'd you learn to do that?
Those are white words, not ours.
What?
Like you.
I have an idea.
You never did answer my question.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
You know what I want.
How do you know he's still not here?
You love him?
No.
I'm guessing no.
You could leave him.
I don't know how.
What's the matter?...Grace?
Nothing.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
What about us?
I could if I had Jake's money.
The money's right here! Get the key!
Good thinking.  What's all this?
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
I'm not sailing his boat.
You know I thought you'd left me back there.
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
Why?
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own.
Time to go for a walk, Jake.
Hope is a four-letter word.
Bobby? Are you all right?
I busted my leg!
Why's that?
Where ya goin'?
Harlin's.
That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.
I need a ticket.
Where to?
Out of here.
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
How much?
One way, or round trip?
One way.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
You got a beer?
What kind?
Beck's.
No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
Morning Grace.
Who was that on the phone?
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
They look nice.
What's the matter?
Help me, Grace, help...
Yes?
Is that the entire message?
Wrap it up.
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
How old is Jeb?
I'll keep it in my office room.
What about Jeb?
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
Is Jeremy okay?
He's asleep.
I don't know. It's been a while.
Do you remember me getting sick?
Not a specific day. What's this about?
When was the last time I wore pink?
I've come to a decision.
Megan?
Yes. Is this David?
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
Yes.
...I think rust.
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.
My turn. What's your favorite song?
What was that?
Think carefully?
What about the game?
Why?
What's he talking about?
In college. A car accident.
I assumed because of the train.
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
Just give me a minute.
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
I thought he was carrying something.
Have you ever tried to develop it?
I don't know what you're asking?
I have to go now.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
He's kind of a miracle.
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
I want to sleep here tonight.
I think it's be better if I was alone.
Why'd you do that?
I'm going to work out.
I'll help you.
How much did you take off?
How much is it?
All of it.
I'm sleeping in my room.
I see.
I'm not scared.
That's great.
I know now.
YOU WON'T GET HURT...
I'll just shoot him once.
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
Yeah, hello.
How are you feeling?
Where were you sitting on the train?
Against a window.
In the passenger car?
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
Twelve years.
You and my mother would have a special connection.
I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
Well, go get it then.
Where is it?
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
You... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em?
Where'd you get the money, huh?
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
You told them cowboys you had it.
Rain's coming.
Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
He's coming ain't he?
We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
Nope.
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
Oh. How long I been here?
Three days. Are you hungry?
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
Are you really going to kill them?
You want... a free one.
Your wife?
Yeah, I guess.
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
Books. He's my biographer.
You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
Mmmm pistols.
Those cowboys messin' him up?
You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
Yup.
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
That much, huh?
You could run off them two cowboys.
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
Like I said, I...
What's your name?
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?
He's... he's dead.
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
N-no, sir?
Oh.
Well, how about it?
Three ways, I figured.
You're goin' back with him?
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
Well... I don't recollect.
Finish him, Ned.
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
You missed him? You didn't...?
They takin' water?
It's gonna get riper yet.
You still think he's in there?
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
Is it him?
Did... you... get... him?
I can't see 'em.
Say, Bill...
First one what?
First one I ever killed.
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
Wha... what f-for?
Lemmee see it.
You... gonna take... the money?
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
I... I... think I'm... shot.
You sure you ain't armed?
A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
We ain't bad men no more, Bill. Hell, we're farmers.
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
How long you gonna be, Bill?
Two weeks, I guess.
He musta been movin' right along.
She gave me the evil eye.
You ain't like that no more.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
Yeah.
Beats the hell out of me.
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
HEY.
You're marking us, Bill.
HEY, KID.
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
IS THAT YOU, KID?
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
Shit.
Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
You... you remember Eagle Hendershot?
Huh? Uh... yeah.
I seen him.
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
I seen her... I seen Claudia too...
Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT?
You want the Spencer, Bill? 
What is it, son?
Who's he?
Three.
That fella come by... Tom.
Did you... did you... ?
All that money... I mean... did you...?
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
No... I meant...
What?
K-k-kill somebody?
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?
Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'...
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
More.
See that scrub oak yonder?
Fuck you.
He's blind, for Chri...
Say, Ned... ?
How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
Jesus.  You done this before?
His pistol must of jammed.
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
He's gonna die, ain't he?
Maybe.
Well, suppose he does?
We'll bury him.
An' if I spot 'em?
Yeah?
Who ?
Keyser Soze
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
They'll never stop.
I love you.
They ruined me tonight.
Come home, Dean.
I know who he is.
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.
Then who goes?
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
Why don't you just calm down'
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
What are we gonna do?
Did you hear what he just said?
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
What the hell do you want?
Get out.
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
I was out of line.
You okay?
I'11 be alright.
Well, I'm sorry.
How are they going to do it?
Three million?
Maybe more.
What is this?
What-are they speaking?
What if I
Ready?
Let's say for example -
with what?
Who's your boss?
The answer is no.
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
You're lying.
A little of both.
Get a grip. I didn't know.
Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
When does he post bail?
Two hours, tops.
He won't go into the interrogation room.
Someplace else, then.
I'11 find him.
What?
I know he was good.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
You know Ruby is in Attica?
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.
Is he the one that killed Keaton?
So this lawyer...
Kobayashi.
Came from Redfoot.
I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
You're stalling, Verbal.
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING .
No...
Keaton was Keyser Soze
You're not safe on your own.
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
You're joking.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Mr. Abraham...
Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
What did he find?
Nothing.
Four cases in three years ...
How did you settle on the amount?
We thought it was just.
You thought it was just.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
And no one will know the truth.
What are you doing here?
... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ...
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
... he wants to testify ...?
This is going to drive the ante up.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
They want to settle.    It means a lot of money.
No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Yes.
Say it.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
Anything special about the case?
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
We went to Code Blue...
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Well, many reasons, actually...
Tell me one?
That's right.
And what did your team do...
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
Ed Concannon.
Objection, we've...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
Just as you are, Sir...
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
No.
Neurology?
No.
Orthopedics?
How is that?
Through, through his book.
What book is that?
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
...of Anesthesiology?
`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
How old are you?
I am seventy-four years old.
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
I did.
Nothing further, your Honor.
No further questions.
I wouldn't do it.
You would not...?
Yes.
Just now...
That's not my handwriting.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
I thought I would need it.
I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
She getting good care over there?
'Code Blue'...
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
The Doctors were not negligent.
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
I didn't do too well for you.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
I.  Yes.  It is.
And you wrote that...
Dr. Gruber ...
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
Yes.
Her doctors killed her.
Well, well, when can we meet again. I'd like to get a deposition..
Thank you ...
... that's perfectly all right.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
I've got nothing to say to you.
You know what happened.
I didn't do it, Mister.
Who are you protecting, then?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
Then why don't you testify?
Yessir.  I'm sorry.
Why is that?
What is it?
Thank you for seeing me.
I need an extension for my case.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Ready, your Honor.
Nothing further, your Honor...
Overruled...
Continental Casualty...
Mr. Galvin's...
Hello, I'm calling from...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
From the magazine?
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
How come you're calling me from...?
This is Miss Costello...?
Yes.  Price...
Kathy Price.
We find that your subscription lapsed...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
D'you find an apartment?
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
Why?
What Hotel are you staying at?
And what are you?  A cop?
I'm a lawyer.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
Maybe what?
What...?
I've got to work...
Why don't you get some rest?
You're going to stay here...?
Do you think it's my fault?
You're talking like a drunk.
And it's over...?
Well, then what are you doing here?
And what makes you so tough?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Is there going to be a later...?
Not if you don't grow up...
Joe...  Joe...
You're pressuring yourself...
Is it over?
What are you going to do?
Thank you.
Dr. Gruber.
He's not in, Sir.
What do you want?
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
Are you out of your mind...?
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
You got a good memory, Franky.
Jimmy?  Bushmills.   Lookit, do me a favor.  I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
Oh shit, what's today?
What happened, Joey...?
I can't talk now.
Yeah?  How's our new witness?
How are you holding up?
You use their witness.
Are you with me...are you awake...?
Yeah.  I'm awake.
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
The broad has disappeared...
What the hell are you doing here?
What are you doing in New York...?
It's locked.
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
... I know.  I went ...
... You saw her?
She told me.
She did?
I just saw her.
In New York?
Hi.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
How old is he?
Who told you that?
Mrs...
Mrs. Simmonds.
Kathy Price...
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
Yes.
One hour.
I did.
A single hour.
Well, well, well.  Huh?
It's a long road that has no turning.
Dr. Towler...
Yes, that's correct.
Yes.
As I've said we had some more...
What happened in those three...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
What happened in those three minutes...?
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Yes.
How'm I doing so far?
Ah? That complicates the problem.
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
How long have you been back?
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
From whom?
I want you.
That's Carlotta Valdes.
There are things you didn't tell me.
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
What for? Who are you?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
Just let me talk to you.
What about?
You.
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
What do you want to know?
Your name. And --
Judy Barton.
Who you are --
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
-- and how you happen to be living here.
It's a place to live, that's all.
But you haven't lived here long.
I told you! Right here!
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
No, you don't owe me anything.
Then will you for me?
Dinner... and what else?
Just dinner.
Because I remind you of her?
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
An hour?
Mmm.
Thank you again. Good-night.
Can I see you tomorrow?
Tomorrow night? Well --
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
No.
No.
But Scottie, you don't have to!
But I like that one, Scottie.
Scottie, what are you doing?
They're none of them right.
I don't like it!
You don't even want to touch me.
Wherever you'd like...
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
Come here.
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
That's what I had in mind.
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
Scottie!
How does it work?
Can't you see?
We're going awfully far.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
But why? Why here?
I need you.
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
No! Let me go!
You can't. You're afraid!
I don't know... Switzerland?
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
Love me... keep me safe...
Why am I here? What happened?
You don't remember.
Where were you?
Where had you been before?
This afternoon.
Oh... wandering about.
Please drink your coffee.
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
Wandering about.
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
One shouldn't live alone.
Some people prefer it.
What?
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
-- talking to you...
I hope we will, too.
What?
Meet again, sometime.
Good-bye.
I don't know.
Shopping?
No.
Well... anywhere in particular?
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
Why?
Do you hear anything?
Only silence. It's always like this.
No birds live here.
Would you like a drink of water?
Where are you now?
Here with you.
Where?
Have you been here before?
Yes...
Where were you born?
Long ago...
Why did you jump?
No, I can't tell you!
Take me away from here?
Home?
Would you know the room?
What else?
A grave...
How do you know?
I know.
There's a name on the gravestone.
I'm here, I've got you...
Don't leave me... stay with me...
No, don't go away!
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
Here with you.
And it's a all real.
My love... because I love you.
No... we're together...
Why?
Let me go.
Madeleine --
Is there something I can do for you?
Yes... you run this hotel.
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
What is her name?
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
How long has she had the room?
Her car is gone.
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
More than you think.
How do you know? Personal experience?
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
I had to quit, Midge.
It wasn't your fault.
I know. Everybody tells me.
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
From that music.
How's your love life, Midge?
Well?
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
What.
Step number two.
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Yeah.
Pop Leibel.
Do you know him well?
The poor thing....
Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
Here you are.
You haven't told me everything.
I've told you enough.
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
Is she pretty?
Carlotta?
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Midge!
Just wander.
Where?
Around.
Mm. Better.
Did you need it?
Yeah.
Oh... this and that.
What have you been doing?
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
What is it, a still life?
She died.
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
She'll be out in a moment.
The stripper's here.
She's fucking hot!
Jesus.
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
How ya doing?
What?
What's that?
I said how's it going?
I didn't hear you.
You're an asshole Adam.
You're an asshole.
Multiple reasons.
Name one.
The floor was wet. She slipped!
Why was the floor wet?
Why?
This is pathetic.
You're pathetic.
What did you say?
You're not a team player.
I have plenty of friends.
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
About anybody but yourself. You never have.
And you're a little fucking reject.
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
Go home!
Don't even start.
She's got no fucking pulse.
Wait!
What?
What are you doing?
What are you talking about?
What do you think you are doing?
Are you sure this was an accident?
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
Just giving the facts.
Bury her out in the desert.
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
Her fucking head was caved in.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
Wait. Wait a minute.
What?
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
That is absolutely not true.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
We have to get going.
I am not flexible on this.
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
What does that mean?
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
What is your problem?
What?
At the seven-eleven.
Who? What are you talking about?
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
They won't figure it out.
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
Don't snap at them!
They're driving me nuts!
What?
They're screaming for Starbursts.
Where's the candy?
We'll be ready Adam.
That's one idea.
I won't do it.
I know and I'm honored...
If anything ever happens to me...
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
No way.
Have you thought about what I said?
I got you.
My god.
Well, oh...
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
So. When is the wedding.
What are you talking about?
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
What is it?
She's not here.
So who's the lucky guy?
Who?
Yup.
Doing the bachelor party thing?
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
She's still working?
Is everything okay?
No I don't.
I don't think so Boyd.
But not tonight.
I got her arm.
What's your fucking point?
What's goosed?
He just had two.
You said that Boyd.
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
Oh, Jesus...call the police.
No.
She's dead. Call somebody!
Shut up.
Nobody knows she's here.
What kind of words?
I'm talking about prayer.
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
He's cracked up.
He is not cracking up.
Boyd...What have we done?
What did you ask me?
What is the question you asked me?
Say it again.
I just want to get married.
Just do it.
What are you going to do?
Take care of business.
That's right.
Okay fine.
Fine? Fine what?
Whatever you say Kojak.
You're a fucking moron.
The hell I did!
The hell you didn't!
You hate women.
True.
Not true.
And what happens when you can't?
Israel doesn't have a King.
Then what do they have?
There's my point exactly.
What? What's your point?
Take Mexico.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
We're goosed.
We're goosed! Goosed by God!
Stop it!
Stop.
Goosed!
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
What?
This is ridiculous.
Why can't we do it through the mail?
Can't we do it on the phone?
Why is this Kid staring at me?
I think so.
The wedding cake check?
Sent it.
Photographer?
Yup.
Caterer?
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
I think I forgot the tent.
You forgot the tent?
I think so.
Why?
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
You can't play around with these tent people.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
What else have you forgot?
Don't you dare.
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
Are we going to do this again?
Well it's bad timing.
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
He is.
He's a moron.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
Who else?
Charles Moore for instants.
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
I just don't see him in the big picture.
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
He's weird.
He's quiet.
He just doesn't talk a lot.
Why? What's his problem?
He's a great chef.
Time out.
That's absurd.
Do you love me?
Of course.
How much?
With all my heart.
We've got problems here.
Seating problems.
Okay.
Keith do not trivialize this.
What kind of seats can we have?
Not padded ones.
So what do we do?
You go down there.
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
Honey I don't have the time...
I need your help.
I'll call them from the road.
Take care of those chairs.
I will.
Do you love me?
I love you.
Hello.
Hi.  Are you calling from jail?
Well I do.
What are you doing?
Just a bit of organizing.
Yeah. Nesting.
I'm mad at you.
Go have fun. Not too much.
Hello.
Hey. It's me.
No. Just like an hour or so.
What about the chairs?
Okay.
What okay?
What!
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
Well, can you come back inside?
Yeah. Sure.
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
Are they fighting?
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
No way.
We're not canceling.
Yeah. You.
No.
Do you love me?
What?
Do you love me?
What kind of stupid question is that?
Who's dead?
The prostitute.
You fucked a prostitute?
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
You killed a prostitute.
Micheal, by accident.
Call the police.
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
He kept saying he was protected.
The only proof is those bodies.
So what do we do?
Move the bodies.
Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
Just kills me...
Everything okay?
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
What does that mean?
It means she's insecure.
I don't care for him.
He's your brother.
Go for it.
I'm getting married...
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
Where did you get that?
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
I don't hear it.
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
No...No.
The first day.
Did she believe you?
A move?
Greenpeace.
Where's Boyd?
Did he try to kiss you?
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
The stone age.
The post-Vegas Man.
A mutant species.
We will.
Good times.
She's dead.
Right.
Shut up Micheal.
I'll come to you tonight.
No, the children sleep with me.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
Where's the camera?
Are there many windows?
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
Don Amalio!
Enedina and Paco ...
What about them?
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
You have no feelings toward ...
Come down here, you scamp.
How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
What do you mean?
Yes, it is.
Don't you ever see him?
And this innocent child.
You must think I am a monster.
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
Leave us alone, Ramona.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
You must listen to me before you go.
Leave me now. You can go to bed.
But what can I say to her, sir?
You believe me, don't you?
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
What will the lady say?
Is it all right?
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
How much is that?
Fifteen yards.
That's fifteen by seven?
That's it.
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
And in the vegetable plot?
It's very good.
My God, what have you done to him!
He was asking for it.
Ramona! Ramona!
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
What's the matter with you?
Why the bad temper?
If you wake first, wake me up.
What are you thinking about?
How in hell does it wind up?
Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
Why?
I don't know -- they've always been there.
Miss Viridiana ...
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
What do you know about me?
I don't understand how you can like being alone so much.
Do they worry you that much, then?
Are they going to work here too?
And ...your friend?
She's left.
Is she coming back?
No.
What's he called?
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
How are you today?
You'll soon find out, you liar!
Stop this!
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
You cannot leave ...
Why not?
There's been an accident.
Where?
Why are you crying?
I'm afraid.
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
A black bull came.
It's a very big one.
Very, very?
Yes -- very, very big!
He came in through the cupboard.
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
What's going on, Moncho?
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
I had so many things to think about!
Forgive me if I have offended you.
She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.
She looks like a sick marrow!
Welcome, miss. I'm Ramona, Don Jaime's servant.
How do you feel?
I have a headache.
Have I slept long?
Hello.
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
What?
How did you see me?
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
Why would they be going there?
I don't know.
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
He was a computer program for crissake.
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
What about them?
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.
Their weapons missing?
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
On my life, I promise you I will.
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
Think you can do it?
How does he know who I am?
He hears...everything.
I haven't been working on anything.
Do I get to see it or not?
Get that fucking thing away from me!
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
How do you kill it?
You need a maid.
What's wrong with Parker?
How should I know?
I wonder how that...
Should I have?
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
It was you, wasn't it?
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
I am beautiful, aren't I?
Help me get out of here.
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
I don't need a babysitter.
He was reenacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
She's beautiful, you know?
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
Don't get out of the car.
Enjoying yourself?
You know I am.
This isn't a game, Parker!
What's the problem?
Which way?
Parker - stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you
We know you didn't kill those guards.
You're not capable of it.
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
Nice work.
Can I ask you something?
You don't know?
You okay?
More or less.
Lindenmeyer?
My guess is dead.
Sid?
How's your pulse?
I couldn't tell you.
Then shoot him already.
What do we do now?
There you go  best seat in the house.
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
<u>Lure</u> him. 
...on the way in.
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
It's the White House.
What about it?
It's <u>producing</u>.
Ames here.  <u>Yessir</u>... 
...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of... 
What can it hurt.
Okay.  Here's what we're gonna do.
And...she's not an Illegal Immigrant?  Is she?  Can I see her "chart?"  Because...
A small, "calico" kitten, sir.  "Calico." 
...can we have a white one...?
Hey, hey, I'm just the Producer, I'm just the <u>Stationmaster</u>, Johnny Green wrote that song, and...
...The Albanian Campaign...
Yeeaahhh...  Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...
And?  NO.  I don't wanna know.  What do you <u>mean</u> "and..."?
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
<u>IT DESTROYED THE ELECTORAL PROCESS</u>.
Come on.
...where?
...how do we Explain That?  Hey?  Am I worried...?
What rig?
What are you talking about?
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
Who we got here...?
We are virtually certain it isn't...
Who's got the story? 
It won't hold.
All I need is the one day.
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
<u>Do</u> it...
What would do that...?
Gimme twenty thousand dollars.
Tell, tell, tell me again.
....we landing?
We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
What's it gonna cost? 
Who would find out?
...the... 
The American "people"?
Yes
Who's gonna tell'em.
...you want us to go to War...
...that's the general idea.
...they sound what?
<u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
<u>Who</u>?
Yes.
...<u>nothing</u>...
...where is the Back End coming from?
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
...can we see the Kitten...?
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?
Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
Waal, that's where you <u>want</u> em...
Why is this putz on the air...

Maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
We're gonna do the <u>Team Song</u>.
...this is magnificent.
...fourteen years...
He just got Hip to us.  He just ended the War.
What are we going to do?
War's over, Pal. 
Ronnie says we don't need'em for another four days.  ...s'there a problem?
How's your wife?
Uh...Didn't we <u>do</u> this?
... you want Schumann saved by an Illegal Alien...?
Stanley, you can't do this....
Oh, MiGod.
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
"...where's my pill..."
CAIN LOOKS DOWN AT HER SCRIPT.  SHRUGS, AND LOOKS UP.
Where is he?
Well, c'n we get him back home?
Captain...  You wanna Take'er up...?
Heavy weather East of here.
Course there's a war.  I'm watching it on Television.
N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?
My name is Ronald Brean.
S'only got to hold for another few days.
What's on your mind?
I have a question for you.
Ask it.
Why do people go to war?
I'll play your silly game.
Why do they go to War?
To preserve their Way of Life.
It can be documented that he displayed the...
...why?
...you the Press Office?
What's more interesting than boffing the girlscout?
But there isn't a B-2 bomber.
China.
When's he coming back...?
Do I know you?
What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action.
If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
What do you think would hold it off?
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
Why Albania?
Who?
I never won an Oscar.
Well, no, well, you couldn't <u>tell</u> any...
"The Country Is At War." 
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
They got to have something that we want.
I'm sure they do.
"Freedom."
...who is this guy...?

And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?
...it's a Teaser!
Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
What is it?
What're you gonna do with Morse Code?
I think it's fine?
In the Folk Music Section.

Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
Where is he now?
Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...
...we get our hands on him?
They got him standing by.
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Not bad for government work.  Having a good time.
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
Well, yes, but the guy <u>did</u> bring Peace.
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
Inaugural Speech, press corp's gonna be jealous of giving up that one...
Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
The Albanian Campaign.

They should be.  Most valuable animal since Sea Biscuit.  <u>Isn't</u> he...

You like it?
Yes.
It's tough to rhyme.

Buddy boy, how ya doing?

What the hell...
Hey the door was open.
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
The stock's going to Pluto!
Sell?
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
You sure about this FAA announcement?
About what?
Don't start, alright.
Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
Your words, not mine...
I guess it's time to hit the road.
What if he asks where I got the money?
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
What if they call him?
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
Rising profits...strong balance sheets, good earnings per share.
Nah, she asked the wrong question.
So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
So what firm you with, pal?
...come on sport, you gotta try harder, I need some exercise for chrissake...
Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
I guess I'll head back...
Why do you need to wreck this company?
...I can't make it tonight.
Hello Bud.
Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
Where is it?
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
You really do believe in destiny?
Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?
Well, why stop at that?
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
Hi.
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
Any better and I'd be guilty.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
It's over you, Gordon.
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.
With Mark?
Yeah, yeah, OK
Well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big.
Anybody want another drink?
We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Weird and tiny huh?
Would you like a closer look?
Yes, I guess you're right
Your books Master Loftmore
Thank you Jenkins
Thank you
Thank you
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Jenkins!
Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
Can I give her a message?
Velcome to ve Vaxverk.
I hope you enjoyed your visit.
Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
They seemed, closing by much 
Tony and China?
Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
What?  Tony and China, together?
That's not what you said last night.
Sarah listen to me.
Safety in numbers man.
Anyone else not coming?
No thank you sir we're fine.
Well?
Well divide 18 into three
Can this be stopped?
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?
Do you have a scarf?
Yes?
It's only two hours away.
I know that.
Of course you will.
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
He loves you very much.  He just--
I miss you.
What do you mean?
I started seeing things.
Did you?
No.  But once I heard...
Who's idea was it?
I didn't want to come.
Then why did you?
Do you really think so?
Fireball?
These are good.
What does she look like?
Try to communicate with her somehow.
Are you humoring me?
What's happening to me?
Yes, but...
Your friend saw them.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
Do you?
No.
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
At the party.
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
Who's that?
Yes?
Well maybe your wife...
She isn't here.
When...when will she be back?
I don't know.
Oh-kay...
Give me that shit.  Your wife.
You're the flower lady.
Um...yes.
I've seen you.  From the window.
Hello?
What?  What are you afraid of?
That's not...It's not like that.
I wanted to apologize.
Would you like some iced tea?
Your house is so beautiful.
Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
Love.
You must think I'm pathetic.
Mrs. Frank?
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
You know where she is?
No, I don't.
You look a little old for a student.
Why are you here?
They're calling me in to work.
Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
What was her major?
Wow.
This is...
He looked like one of the Monkees.
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
I didn't sleep with him.
...just so she could cut them off.
He was so pissed.
I came in from my room...
How you holding up?
Good.  I'm good.
Okay, I'm a little tender.
Kambucha mushroom tea...
You're discussing me with your psychic?
Thanks, but I'm fine.
Yep.
Know what I think?
What?
Seance.
Jody, no...
Telling you...
...no...no...no...
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
Someone's there.
In the window.  Norman's at work.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
The planchette?
Nothing's happening.
Oh...
Mef?  What's Mef?
I have to go.
Are you okay?
Does Norman know?
Jody, she's alive.
Something was there.  You saw it.
But Claire--
Oh God...you knew.
I was down in Adamant...
I'm a terrible friend.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
If she was dangerous before--
Jody, she tried to kill him.
I know.
I can't believe this is happening.
Did he say that?
I think three...
She's awake.
When's she out of here?
It's today?
Whatcha reading?
If you have to work...
How are you?
It's okay if you're not.
Not the focus.
It's just us now.
Tired?
Nope.
Did you...
Maybe we should just...
Of what?
Of him I think.
Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.
That's not what I'm sug--
But what if something happens?
I know.
Mmnph.
Unless you need me to come home...
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
In the house.  I was scared.
What kind of whispering?
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
I think so.  Maybe.
You are so brilliant.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
Well, that's nice.
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
"...for my father."
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
Did you tell her?
What?  No.  No.
Sorry.  You understand.
Get down!  He'll see.
What's going on, Claire?
He killed her.
Our house.
It's a flare.
See?
What am I looking at?
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
When you do this, I swear...
...Don't get all...
...like it never even happened...
There we go.
I don't need a shrink.
Harvey says he's amazing.
What are you doing out here?
This is the Feur thing?
How do you know this?
We had a seance.
Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
Keep your voice down.
I'm sorry...
Do I have everything?
Yep.
I felt you...looking through me...
We walked all night...
You dropped a glass.
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
But I don't remember.
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
The...
Stop...
...I'm positive this time...
It's Madison Fra--
I take it your not mad at me.
Ow!
What's the matter?
It's too rough.
Who?
Your wife...
"You know..."
I was there.
It was last year.  We were having troubles.
So you fucked a student?!
Who?
I tried to break it off!
You should have tried harder.
Claire...
She did it.
We don't know that for sure.
She's gone.
She can't be here without me.
Look for antiques...
Adamant.
Huh.
Do you know it?
Don't think so.
What's that for?
Nothing.
I'm cooking you dinner.
You don't have to do that.
I know.
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
Mmmuh...
Shhhh.
:Would you stop it!
I have seen him again.  Last night.
With his hands!
How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?
What have the witches always asked of you...?
He made that quite clear, yes.
Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.
I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
I beg your par---
When did she die...?
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
I had you sent away.
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
You kept her in this filth in restraints...?.
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
Go back, MICHAEL... Go Back
The door, Michael.  find the key...
Michael...  Do what you can.
Lasher - bring us through!
Parents say he - uh - fell -
FAST.
uh - then he - be just -
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
STOP!
YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
Made it...?
It is from love.
Go away!  I don't want you here.
If that were true, I would not be here.
A girl...?
What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
I LOVE him!
Do not tell me that!
I love Michael...
What is wrong...?
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
Harder...
Harder...
Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
Yessss...
I'm glad you're around to say it.
What do you see...?
Just one.  The bar's closed.
The one time I want it to work...
Rowan...
HARDER!
Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
I was born, in New Orleans, too-
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
Why don't you let at do that...?
Doctor's orders- - -?
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
Seems more like a year than a month.
We're quite a pair, you and I.
Hello...?
Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!
Do you love me, Michael...?
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Maybe he's just - waiting...
Ro, how long have we known each other.
You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?
Wanna snack...?
Hey - you're bleeding.
You look a little green.
Nobody makes a car like them Nasis...
That's cause we're below sea level.
You did that, didn't you...?
Is he - is he gonna die...?
If it's a boy --- Taylor.
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
When aid you get home last night...?
I can't.
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
Lasher...  Where --- where is ---
On which planet...?
You can't just -
'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?
Wow...
I'm getting --- left behind.
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
Rowan Mayfair.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
You really love this guy...?
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
Which do you think is her best shot...
The one on the left - definitely...
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.
OH MY GAWD!
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
That's right...
All the time?
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
This must be one of the old keys -
It doesn't mention 'females only'
I lost the touch
What are you doing?
My names isn't ANGELA...
So what do you do?
Oh, about six years since I graduated
And how many people have you killed?
I don't know
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
No she didn't...
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
How long have you been watching me?
Tell me how it happened...
Why should I?
STEPHANIE?
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
What's wrong?
What is it?
Where are you going?
We've got nothing to talk about
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
First finish your tea...
Why did you let him in?
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
I loved you ELLEN - why did you do this?
Don't you want me now LESLIE
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
I want you out now
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
It's been what, three years?
What's this all about?
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
Just put it in my room
Her husband left her
Dr STECKLER?
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...
Sugar?
I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.
That's crazy talk.
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
Who the hell was your father?
...A bouncer? Are you serious?
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
So far away? In Xenia?
Check this out.  Hurry!
Hurry.
What is it now?
Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty?
Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
Oh, how inappropriate is that!
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
You got everything you ever wanted.
Naked girls, wild sex, video games. No wonder it's called "Heaven."
Never say never.
What gives, Don Corleone?
We reinvented ourselves.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
From your lips, to God's ears.
You go first.
Ladies first.  I insist.
Well. The prom's coming up.
Yeah?
And I was wondering.
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
Hi, Teddy Bear.
Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
Do it?
Which you pulled, hard!
Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
You have changed since second grade.
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
We miss you. We miss our son.
You guys are my parents.
Son.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
Sorry I--
It's okay. You need me?
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
I-I don't have the keys.
You do know how to drive?
The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.
It's your car. These are all your cars.
I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
The one with the horses.
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
Who exactly ARE you?
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
Teddy? I was thinking.
Ted! Do something!
What do you want me to do?
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
You're on the next plane home.
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
My new bike.
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
If you could just sign right there.
You want it in writing?
He was my Grandfather, too.
I meant biologically.
That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
I have absolutely no intention--
Your article sucked.
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
Then I'll write about YOU.
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
I guess.
She said peanuts, you cretin.
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
Why can't you be nice to me?
Where are we going?
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
He phoned it in.
I see.
Your dad taught you everything.
It's all so complicated.
Eventually you'll let go.
You're amazing.
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
That's probably my office.
Well? Where the hell are you?
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
That's refreshingly deviant.
I'm very aural.
You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
Do you trust me, Julie?
Not a chance.
That's hard to believe.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.
Very ambitious. I like that.
Yellow pages?
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
That's part of growing up, honey.
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
Only the best for my mother.
You promise you'll finish school?
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
But who would run the store?
I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
I never figured you for a pimp.
Rules are rules.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
You called the cops on us?
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
Of course I like girls.
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
As much as possible.
Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
Me? The King of Coitus?
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
I told you you could do it.
I was like a different person tonight.
You were the new and improved you.
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
Really? You'd do that for me?
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
My father must've been amazing.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
What are you doing?
That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
Bad news.
People pay good money for that?
I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
Talk to me Artie.
How you doing, Artie?
You look pretty.
And where might that be?
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too...
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.
You okay?
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
Maybe she used another name.
I don't know what to say...
I've got that two o'clock in town.
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
You saw the news today?
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
Guess I kind of lost it there.
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
If you want company...
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
Will you do me one favor?
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
That bothers you?
About a year ago.
He dropped Jimmy off first?
So you were alone.
Did he come in with you?
At that point were you able to fight him off?
He did say something.
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
Ms. Toller?
A ride.  You want one?
It's those rocks, up there.
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
Oh, for Christ's sake.
What are you looking at?
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
Get off my property.
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Hi, Mon.
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
Okay, what's the matter?
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.
I would hardly say you look like trash.
Kelly.  What is it?
I miss Dad.
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
He... Sam Lombardo?
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
Where, the mall?
Don't forget the car wash.
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
So, where you off to now?
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
Do it to ourselves?
Kelly.  Is Suzie there?
I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...
Hello?
Hello.
And you believe her?
That's not your line.
Say you love me.
I love you.  Now give me the line.
I'm running away.
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
I just want my life back...
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
No.
Will they?
It doesn't look like it.
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you?
I had to go look for this coupon.
Yes.
And she wanted to talk.
But she ran away.
How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
Sam...
That was about as grim as it gets.
What's wrong?
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
No.
Shit. Here we go again.
J. S. Bach.
Jim West.
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
But don't pull that again.
Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
That should put us ahead of the criminals.
Aha!
Prepare what?
That's a lot of butler.
Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
Almost?
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
What was all that back there?
All what?
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
At least I tried something.
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
You might have mentioned you had that.
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
Can you fill me in here?
Know what this is?
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
This is good.
Oh, damn!  That's it.
It's better than nothing.
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
Willard...
It's not a guy...
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
Not again.
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
When we find him, he is mine.
Oh, thank you.
What?  President Grant is...!
There's only seventy-eight.
It was in your book.
My God!  He's so excessive!
What is this?  A whole new train?
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
He calls it the Tarantula.
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
A new friend?
Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
Would that include me?
You've... done... this... before.
My.  It's gotten longer.
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
French?
Good work.  Really.
This is Colonel Richards.
And?
No, sir... just a businessman.
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
He had a pressing engagement.
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
Dr. Pemberton?
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
This is something.
Now it's a bomb.
Well?
They're coming.
When are they coming?
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
You're not going to use it, are you?
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
You left me to die, friend.
You managed alright.
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
You're chasing a dream.
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
Thank you, friend.
Willow Ufgood.
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
Sir!  I have to talk to you.
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
You!  Are you the mother of that child?
I can't.
I can't.
Why not?
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
I do what I'm told.
You're a fool.  Now put her back.
Why did you say that?
Because it's true.
Sorsha.
He's no magician.
Then you get us out of here.
Who is that girl, anyway?
We're a tiny version of all that?
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
Thanks for your help, Peck.
You a woodcutter?
You all right?
Smells like a battle.
Are you a warrior?
What's that?  I hear something!
You hear trouble.
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
You gotta promise to feed her.
I will.
Fresh goat's milk.
Time to change her diaper.
Because she's sick.
Where's the baby??
Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
I'll help you...!
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
Did she ask about me?
She asked about you, Madmartigan.
She's in love.
Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places.
Watch it!
Can't we keep it, Dada?
Who are you!  Who are you!
No!
You must learn magic.
I'm all finished.  Now what?
What's the magician's weapon?
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
Ouch!!
His will.
I just wanted to test it first.
Tir Asleen.
No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
Time is running out.
Patience, Willow.
Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
I'm not going in there.
Get back here, Rool!
Madmartigan.
Who is he?
Who??
I'm getting her out of there!
This is not going well.
Talk!  Say something!
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
Maybe milking.
Milking?
Cows. You know, cows?
I've seen pictures.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Where's Timmy and Buck?
Who are these orphans, anyway?
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
John, why?...
I came to see Rachel Lapp.
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
Your hole is healed, then?
Nail it!
Everything is all right, John.
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?
He was... like him.
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
Hey, Sam...
...I want to say a thing.
What are you going to do?
Don't let them hurt you.
Have you got your gun on now?
How reliable is this kid?
Oh, he's good.
Amish.
Yeah.
Maybe.
You know who?
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
Who else knows?
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
Who else knows?
You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out.
It's all over, Paul.
You have no right to keep us here.
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
They kid a lot.
But not a good tired.
Home.
No, no doctor...
Does anybody know I'm here?
Only the elders.
How long have I been here?
Tell him his tea stinks.
Something wrong with buttons?
Buttons are Hochmut.
I'm going this morning.
But Stoltzfus said...
Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
We had some lemonade and he left.
What else can you do?
But... You may not be well enough.
When will you be going?
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.
You're so sure of that?
Where's my baggy pants?
Anybody know about this?
I didn't even know about it.
You hear me?
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
Say again?
You know where he is.
Wrong.
You'd lie to protect him.
You admit you're lying?
I admit I don't know where he is.
You're the first one he'll contact.
Did you find him?
I don't know where he is.
Everything okay?
Yes, thank you very much.
John said you're Amish.
Yes.
Good morning.
Who was that man?
Is the English dead?
No...
I am not a child.
You are acting like one!
No, Rachel...
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
She say where he is?
What about Carter?
Tight. But I'm working on him.
He's not in this building.
He'll live.
You might have killed him!
Get back in there.
My son is out there!
Momma... are they angry with us.
They are English. They don't understand.
I wish dawdie was with us.
Aunt Em!
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
To see?
If she...
If she?
From now on you'll be history
Uhhhh -- yes...
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
Oh --
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
Oh, please give me back my dog!
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
Run, Toto, run!
...Toto, too?
Toto, too.
Oh, now?
Are you ready now?
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
Aw, come, come, come --
No, they won't - honestly.
That's our farm!
...her face is careworn.
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
That's right.  What's she doing?
...bed.
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
Now you're seeing reason.
Oil can.....Oil can....
Did you say something?
Where do you want to be oiled first?
Oh --
No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
Oh --
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
Oh - I'll get it!
We might.
And him a brain.
No.  Why only --  Oh --
Oh! Something bit me, too!
Dorothy!
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
...yes.
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
...has been simply unbearable.
A home --
Yes -- let's run!
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
How about a hippopotamus?
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Supposin' you met an elephant?
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
I'd sooner wait outside.
But why?  Why?
Because I'm still scared!
Oh, come on.
Oh -- Oh, come on.
Does it work?
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
Did they hurtcha?
They're coming back!
...Ain't it the truth!  Ain't it the truth!
Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
...don't talk.
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
...yes.
Ohhhh --
Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
Ohhh --
...free!
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
They would?
Um-hmm.
You're going to see a Wizard?
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
To Oz?
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
What?
Oil can what?
He said his mouth.
Here -- here --
The other side....
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
Oh, come on now - everybody -- 
No -- No -- No -- No!
Yeah.
Ah --
Dorothy next!
What if it were a brontosaurus?
Who at?
What happened?
Somebody pulled my tail.
Oh, you did it yourself!
I -- Oh --
Here --   Come on.
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
I've got a plan how to get in there.
Fine.  He's got a plan
And you're going to lead us.
Yeah. Me?
Up!
Where -- where do we go now?
You humbug!
Sneaking up on me, eh?  Why! 
I haven't slept in weeks.
Why don't you try counting sheep?
Not even a rhinoceros?
It's a whatzis.
It's a whatzis?
Whozat?
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.
Where do we go now?
Mr. Gale!
... about Dorothy.
You mean she bit you?
No, her dog!
Quiet!
No, sir!
That's right.
We do.
To Oz?
Animals that -- that eat straw?
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!
Hey, Dorothy!
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
Let's.
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
Ha -- ha -- ha --
Oh, did - did you see that?
Oh - look out.
It's a whozis.
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
Now, now, don't fret.
Oh, dear, dear.
Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right. We must worry about Dorothy.
...to Dorothy!
Oh --
Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out. 
No, you don't.
Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
Oh - upstairs, quickly!
It makes you nervous?
What about us?
But I still want one.
-- Ruined my exit!
You new?
What happened to Len Tashka?
When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
The plutonium is missing.  Theyve taken the core!
Whos she?
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
Makes her look even more innocent.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
The King pipeline.
Is there another way?
Hes sealed himself in.
Do you know what youre doing?
What kind of bikes did you ride?
But what if...
I love Christmas in Turkey.
Its just a scratch.
Then maybe Id be... open to that.
Perhaps after this ... test?
Constructions not exactly my line.
Ive scheduled a medical for you.
Its barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
You havent been given an assignment in this case.
Who?
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
That which does not kill me makes me stronger.
The inside man?
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
Your last chance. Take the money.
Your last chance. Give me the name.
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
In case youve forgotten.  Im dead already.
Beautiful, isnt it?
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
He was my father.
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially Kings daughter.
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
Oh my God...were buried alive...
I cant stay here.
I cant stay.
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think Im a coward.
James...
I have to go.
Then take me with you.
I dont want to be safe!
Vodka martini.
If this little show is for my benefit, Ill take you home right now.
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
You can drop the act, its over.
Wheres M?
All this, because you fell for Renard?
Was this all about the oil?
Know what happens when a man is strangled?
One... last... screw?
Valentin Zukovsky.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
Shes no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
Whats your business with Elektra King?
And the payoff on the tables?
Wheres the sub going?!
The Maidens Tower.
No! Bond!
Ill send someone out.
Someone will come.
Warm.
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
He was a...good lover?
Do we have the range of Renards plane?
Its heading for the oil terminal.
Any word from him?
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
Walter --
A whore fucking.
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
God isn't there to do it.
Hi, Jon.
The bearer of bad news.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
Would you like me to stay?
Mm hmm.
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
What -- am I --
Jon, where are we?
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
Jon -- for Gods sake, what do you see?
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
Adrian -- you've lost it.
And what if youre wrong?
Im not.
Damn straight.
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
His . . . whatever.
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
What are you up to?
They're practically on us . . .
What?
What's he doing?
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
Welcome back, Night Owl.
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
Those cars.  What year is this??
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
What do you mean, frame-up?
Coward.  Giving up.
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
We should get back --  What?
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
I can fix it.
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
Did you know he was back on the streets?
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
Their real names, please.
I don't know their real names.
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
I'm terribly sorry.
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Adrian.
Don't rub it in.  I live here.
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
Maybe I'll do that.
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
New information.
Ever see one of these before?
Who the hell are you?
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
What is this place?
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
Is that all?
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
We're not after car thieves here.
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
The scum of the Earth.
But programmable. And expendable.
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
What do you get if you finish?
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
Like what?
Yorgi asked me to.
You do everything Yorgi says?
Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you.
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
They left. To a fortress in the mountains.
We'll have to go after them.
Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three.
Where'd the damn truck go?!
Toadies right behind.
You okay?
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
He's shut out the communication circuit!
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
Nothing. He had two days.
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
The Peace conference...
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
Sorry, "dude".
What's so damn funny?
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
Help me with this guy.
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
That's the guy.
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.
You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
I wish I could go.
I don't like him being here.
What's wrong with him?
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
I'll tell you one thing though.
Into the Hudson?
Jean... can you?
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
How long have you been in Alaska?
I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
Anything else I can get you?
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
By reading my thoughts?
If necessary.
You should always work with a spotter.
Were you now?
What do you say?
Let go.
He's uptight.
He takes his work seriously.
Logan, do you see this ring?
Dr. Grey.
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
What is it you intend to do to me?
I do love a good check mate.
What do you want?
Where are we going?
To find Rogue.
You designed this yourself?
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
I felt like she almost killed me.
If she held on any longer she could have.
I lost him.
Is that what you're looking for?
A piece.  Only a piece.
I'll find him.
I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
Yes, my dear, he is.
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
You have the wrong house.
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
No!
What was your grandfather's name?
Where did you get this cauliflower?
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
No, sir.  It will never happen again.
Give him an extra dollar.
Carlson!
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
Baack!
What?
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
MMMmm!
Is it that music?
Still happy you married me?
MMmmm.
Love me oodles and oodles?
Darling!
Hello...?
Surprised?
Well... yes.
Miss me?
Darling!...you will be careful!?
Of course.
You have your tickets?
Yes.
And your passport?
Yes.
Promise??
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
Will you miss me?
Oh, nice.
I hope you like large weddings.
You're incorrigible!
Does that mean you love me?
I will!  Goodbye, darling!
Goodbye, darling.
Darling!
Surprised?
What a strange fellow.
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
Are you suggesting I call him master???
No, of course not.  I just meant...
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
That's a tough choice.
Is it worth taking a chance?
Good night.
You mean... the laboratory??
Yes!... the laboratory.
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
There seem to be quite a few books.
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
Well... we'll see.
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
Dr. Frankenstein?
Fron kon steen!
Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune.
But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
How long will this whole thing take?
Why did you do that?
Break that old man's violin.
Yes, sir.
One week at the most!?
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
I beg your pardon?
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
A piece of what?
How old are you, young man?
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
Frederick Frankenstein?
Are you putting me on?
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
And do you also say Fro dereck?
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
I see.
No, it's pronounced Aye gor.
But they told me it was Ee gor.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
Are these your bags?
There.
I beg your pardon?
There wolf!  There castle!
Why are you talking like that?
I thought you wanted to.
What wockers?
The wockers with the knockers.
Home!
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
Aye-gor!
Fro-derick!
But what you were doing?
Just putting up some tea.
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
What is this place?
What a filthy job!
Could be worse!
How?
Do you have the name I wrote down?
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
I want that brain.
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
It's always been one of my favorite names.
If you like -- just hurry!
Throw the second switch!
What?
More, do you hear me?
What?
Throw the third switch!
Don't try to cheer me up that way.
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
But you did -- I just heard it.
Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
Original.
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
You can say that again.
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
... I'm glad that's...
No, no!  That whole thing!
Yes, Master!

Get the sedative ready!
What's that tune that you're playing
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
Extremely well.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.
Would you like a sandwich?
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
Inga, wake up!
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Ooh!
Look, Doctor!
Well, this explains the music.
Oh, doctor!
Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.
A god?
Yes!
Right here?
Raise the platform, hurry!
Reputation.  Reputation!
Oh, Doctor!
I think you've done it, master.
It looks that way.
What are you going to do?
Me?  Sing?
All right -- give it to him!
Are you serious??
Give him the sedative!
Did you do it?
Good night, Doctor.
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
Just passing through the night.

It wouldn't be fair to her.
Are you ready for me?
MMMMmmmmm!
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???

You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?

So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?
Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
