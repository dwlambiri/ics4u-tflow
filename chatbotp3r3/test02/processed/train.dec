Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Let me see what I can do.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
Where?
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
I believe we share an art instructor
Tons
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
Let's go.
I hope so.
They do not!
No.
Joey.
I don't have to be home 'til two.
Expensive?
Hi, Joey.
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Can we go now?
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
In 9th.  For a month
Why?
But you hate Joey
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
You set me up.
Perm?
Exactly my point
And where're you going?
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Daddy, no!
Just for a minute
No, but
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
So they tell me...
C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
Who is she?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
You wanna go out with him?
He seems like he thrives on danger
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
That's what I just said
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
Dead at forty-one.
It's her favorite band.
No, I ' m not.
Don't make me do it, man
It's off. The whole thing.
She's partial to Joey, not me
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
She kissed me.
Where?
You get the girl.
Not at all
Away.
Your sister here?
And why would I do that?
What do you think?
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
You just said
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
Fifty, and you've got your man.
What?
A hundred bucks a date.
Forget it.
Forget her sister, then.
A deal's a deal.
Do what?
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Are you lost?
Nope - just came by to chat
We don't chat.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
You and Verona?
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
An attempted slit.
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
William didn't even go to high school
That's never been proven
Neither has his heterosexuality.
Who cares?
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Who?
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
My mission in life.
Oh, right.  Friday.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
Seven-thirty?

That's what you want, isn't it?
Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
Funny, you're the only one
I'm fine. I'm
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I know, just let me sleep
I told you
You don't care if I die
Why?
Dorsey.
Were you in jail?
Then why'd you ask?
Why'd you lie?
Do what?
This.
My father wouldn't approve of that that
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
BIANCA
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so --
Pleasant?
Unwelcome.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
Try lookin' at it from this angle
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
I dazzled him with my wit
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
Acting the way we do.
Yes
How?
For. . . ?
Fallacy.
The duck?
Hearsay.
I hate peas.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
No one else knows
Go to the prom with me
You know what I mean
No.
No what?
No, I won't go with you
Why not?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
What?
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.
Why can't we agree on this?
As a parent, that's my right
So what I want doesn't matter?
Which parts?
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Hi.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Yeah.  I guess.
Oh yeah.
Right.
Kat a fan, too?
Yeah...
What?
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Good enough.
Yeah.
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
With the teeth of your zipper?
See you next week!
Make anyone cry today?
You're not helping.
But -- who -- what --?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Did I have anything to say about it?
That ' s what I thought
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
We'll all go crazy...
If they agree to follow me, yes.
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
I know.
Thank God...
That's something you can't decide.
You don't usually ask.
I am busy inside.
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
Yes... I remember...
Appointment to what?
Viceroy of the West Indies.
There'll be a time.
You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
This time with me!
Not bad.
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
No?
... for a commoner?
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
What...?  Do I have so many already?
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
All of them created by people like me.
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Chief knows.
Thousands.
Why?
Chief says -- he has a God.
... and also to bring medicine.
Chief says...
Ask him if he will help.
You did the same to your God!
That's what it says.
How did you manage it?
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
So was Christ!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
Colon!  Don't!
Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
Give me absolution.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
I knew you would.
New worlds create new people.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
What did they say about Granada before today?
That she was impregnable.
Surely you can do anything you want.
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
My horse doesn't work.
You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
Twenty eight.
Six days ago, yes.
You must be mad...!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You think I don't know that?
We're lost!
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You're right.  Let the men decide.
He must be replaced.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Here.  I have your money.
Where are we going?
I'm coming with you.
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
Oh, sure.
I was all of these.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
No.  No way.
But it's...
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
Yes, but he was a cop.
They won't until this is over.
Divorced.
Yeah.  This way.
Yes, I considered it.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
What about back home?
No.
What are you asking me?
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
I'm sorry.
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
I'm glad I met you.
Right.
In the kitchen.
I'll make some for us.
I'll get my clothes.
Pouring it out!
I don't want to drag you down with me.
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
Who do you think, Chief?!
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
I let her take a shower.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
No!  Nothing happened.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
What was that, Korfin?
When?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
You ready?
A timer.
Takin' a bath.
It's okay.
Yeah.
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
What are you saying?
She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
No, what is it?
Nah, I musta missed it.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Good.  Good.  Commendable.
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
My folks are.
Stay here.
Mind if I ride along with you?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
Better than one.
I'm on duty.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Something back home?
I don't have a girlfriend.
My point exactly.
I'm serious here.
So am I.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
What do you want?
I kill someone famous.
Then do it, asshole.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
There are two bodies found at this point.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Is it drug related?
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Alright?
Alright.
Hey.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
I'm not.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
You're not so bad yourself.
Yeah.
Well, that's great.
I love you.
Tonight.
You promise?
Yeah.  I promise.
Okay.
See you later.  Good luck.
Thank you.
Don't be late.
Not what.  Who.
Okay.  You ready?
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
And what do you do with the bones?
No.  Are you proposing?
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
Where's Czech girl?
Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.
I have five-hundred dollars.
Is there a problem?
He doesn't speak English.
New York's finest.  This is his case.
In here, says he wants a million.
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Okay.
I want to document my trip to America.
We have no money.  Come on.
How you erase this?
I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
Does it hurt?
Don't want to film this?
Put the camera down, Oleg.
The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
Shut up.  Look!
No, I don't get that!
Surprise!  Surprise!
Ha. Ha.
A job?
Yes, the money is good.
As a plumber?!
It's easy to learn.
What are you doing here?
You've got a call.
You want the tape?  There it is!
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
Alright.  Go ahead.
What are you coming here to do?
I'm here for movies.
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
No way!  He's mine!
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
He's my collar!
Well, he killed my partner!
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Oh yeah?  Guess again.
I used an accelerant.
Yeah?  What kind?
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Oh yeah, why?
Don't blow your nose!
What??
You hear that question, Garcia?
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.
Not good.
What the hell happened?
They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted.
She's wonderful.
Right. Just a sec.
Okay. 
Okay, come on down.
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
It's about my salary cheques.
Yes.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Yes, I thought so.
But not completely inconceivable?
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I guess it isn't.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
Are you reasonably awake?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
No.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Yes.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
Well, don't worry about it.
And don't you worry about it.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Yes, it is, Hal.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
Well, what is it?
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Are you coming to my party?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
She's in the bathroom.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Thank you.
Well, how's it going back there?
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
How is gregor?
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, very pleasant.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Yes, really, thank you very much.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
I see.
Well, I'm glad about that.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
Any clue as to what it is?
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
Thank you very much, Hal.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
Hammond.
Yeah, I've been busy.
How about chargin' the battery?
Vodka.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
Pros.
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
Here's hoping, baby...
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
Would you guys...
No chance.
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
Sure, anything you want.
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
I got a lot to protect.
I'll think about it.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Thank you.
Want to try it again?
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
We eat when I say we eat.
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
You have a good time?
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
Must be billy's girl.
Come on.
Half a million.
Jesus.
Not likely, convict.
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
You stay with me...
No way...
Hello. And goodbye.
What about Ganz?
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
Luther's on the move...
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
Don't worry about it.
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
Yeah?
I lost them, that's what happened.
How did they get away?
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
You couldn't get to him?
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
So do you...been a long day.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
I'm heading out. How about you?
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
You're hopeless.
What's wrong with that?
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
That's the way I see it, too.
Call me later.
You sure you want me to?
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
Guess people ought to know who I am...
Yeah, one of my favorites.
You made the front page.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
So am I.
Jack?  What was that?
Just a second, that's all!
Hi, it's me...
Fuck you.
Hiya, kid.
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
That's what I always say.
How would you know?
That's no bull.
Shut up.
What do you want?
Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
Can't complain.
Yeah, old times.
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
You chickenshit punk...
Not bad, not bad.
Naw, right here's okay.
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
Five bills.
Five.  On credit.
This ain't a credit business.
Try and take it.
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Corn-i-Lius?
At your service.
Napoleon... small.
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
The case was stolen?
You know exactly where they are!
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
No thank you.
I know...
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
I brought the girl remember?
The girl?
You noticed...
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
We have to save the world.
Good luck..
Of course.
When is she not in trouble?
Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
Yes..thank God..
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
Perfect.
It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
They are... with me...
Hey bud! Finger here.
How do I look?
Like shit.
How many points you got left on your license?
In your dreams! See you tonight!
5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..
...'Scuse me?
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
We will be ready, Lord.
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
Have you pulled yourself together?
...Not yet.
You little sleaze bag!
...Ma???
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
You have nine points left on your license..
Thanks for reminding me..
This is a police control action..
Found it?
It's like a cab isn't it?
Fuck it! Hold tight!
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
To save the world.
Where have I heard this song before?
You're the only one left alive...
I've had enough good news for today
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
I'm not going.
Why not?
What is it?
I thought you were divorced.
Oh, yes you will...
Uh..you're welcome.
Cornelius..
Oh god!
Learning language.
Which one?
All 900.
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
Apipoussan?
...Hoppi-hoppa.
You get that off the screen?
OK, you can turn around!
No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
I told you not to read all that crap!
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
I want to sleep... forever...
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
Exactly.
I love you...
Been here long?
You're welcome..
Actually only one cell survived..
Have you identified it?
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
An elephant couldn't crack it.
And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
...What do you mean?
How much time is left?
Perfect, Mr. President.
Wait or act.
Recommendations.
Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
To fame.. salud..
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
No... not at all.  Where are you?
How's our deal coming along?
...I can't wait to be among you.
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Okay, I believe you.
I love you.
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
Tom?  Where have you been... ?
Just do it, Amy, please, go.
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
You couldn't?
You don't understand...
You're killing me...
Don't...
Mrs. Christian.
What?
There's nothing harder.
Snuff?
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
I'm telling you...
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
Nobody knows anything.
What can I do for you today?
A fellow investor.
Hmm.
Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
Is it?
I want to watch you work.
I'll consider it.
What's the problem?
I'm camera shy.
Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
Right here.
Where are the women?
They should be here any minute.
Take out your gun!
I remember him.
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
Bring the film, or we kill him.
Alright, Tom.
We do.
Why don't they come to me?
Eddie.
Yeah, who's this?
I know what you did.
What?
I know what you did.
Who is this.
What the fuck are you.. ?
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
How'd you find me here?
Fuck you!
What do you want?
Who is Machine?
I don't know...
I want his name.
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
What the fuck do you want from me?
Because we're going there.
You got absolute zero.
Show me where you buried her.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
Where?  Show me where.
Don't think I won't.
I never killed anyone.
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
That's right.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
I'm asking.
Fuck you.
You'll get it when we get there.
Yeah... guess so.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
Three, four years.
Not quite.
Four hundred a week, off the books.
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
See you then.  Oh, and, don't call me "pops."
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
Twenty-five.
Where are your parents?
I don't know, where are yours?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
You're learning.
Where does he sell it?
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
Great.
It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
I try to be.
He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
Cash, stock certificates, and this...
I'm afraid I don't...
Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
You don't have any other choice.
You've found missing persons before.
Nothing remotely like this.
I'm not positive this means anything.
I'm here.
You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
How are you?  Having any luck?
That's exactly what I am.
She just seemed... depressed... ?
It got to be too much for him.
Are you religious?
No.
You should be.
Do you think the police did a good job?
I don't know.  I think so.
Will you let me look?
Those are her belongings.
Her belongings?
No, sir, he is not.
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
I don't want to.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
What's wrong?
Kristen...
I can't find him.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
We have matching luggage.
What?
That obvious, huh?
Then you saw him, too?
You're his sister, right?
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
Three days.
Is there something we can do?
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
It's okay, we're just about there.
You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
Save it for later.  Come on!
Alright, I think I see salvation...
Enough of that crap.
Let me talk to you.
Your distraught.  It'll help...
Avoid-all-contact-day.
What?
Oh God!  He killed them!
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
You don't get it, he's after me...
Don't worry, honey
It's okay, Dan
What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
Huh?
It's lonely in there, in my room.
My name is...
How did you know that?
My friend, with the funny hand.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
Sorry, babe.
He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
There you go.  Love you.
Me too.
To take a picture.
It's just across the park.
Sobering...
Very funny.
Alice...
Since my little girl became a mom...
You disappointed in me?
I've got to go.
Now.
Had kind of a long night.
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
If they actually bothered to bury her.
So did Dan.
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Yeah.  I'm just aces.
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
Mark!
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
My baby!
What, you named it already?
That's their problem.
No shit.
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
My undying love.  Have some.
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
Makes you look like a nun--
I want to talk about the baby.
Faint.
Stick around, please?
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
My father!  He's not - ?
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
I don't know.
'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
Listen!  Hear that?
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
The sound again?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
We'll have to look for them later.
I'm with <u>you!</u>
Seems to be all around...
What about down?
I...don't know!
We hope!
Yes, Griff?
Radiation level...constantly rising...
What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
What direction does the system indicate?
There's got to be an explanation!
After torpedo room:  Report!
Take a look.
Thirty-four seconds!
That's what I said!
But - what can we accomplish?
We can <u>ram</u> him!
Nothing we can do, now.
I am afraid not.  Therefore -
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Of course.  But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
Toward the Pole!
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
No.
Same old shit.
How soon?
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
I hear Twombley got shot.
Yeah.
No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
Shit! What are we gonna do?
We bought you.
That was me.
Yeah.
You might not kill it.
You think so.
Yeah?
Drafted by the Red Sox.
You played for the Sox?
Double A. New Britain.
They said.
Hmm.
Yeah.
This way.
Sun's gettin high.
Deers have ears too.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
In the chest.
No, I mean whereabouts.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
You stayed away?
Yeah.
Where'd you get the blood?
What blood?
On your sleeve.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
What?
Saw him do it?
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
He sure as hell won't.
Lawford?
I don't care. They're out.
Do what?
You know.
Break stuff?
Yeah. It's stupid.
I guess they're stupid.
To us it was.
But it's not funny now.
What are you talking about?
I just think you used to be bad.
What then?
It's stupid.
It's fun.
No what?
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Jesus, why?
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Pop?
Oh.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
What do you want, then?
Nothing.
Fine.
What are you sorry for?
You can't.
I know.
You're a policeman.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
I want to go home.
Okay, let's go home, then.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
I'm not saying that.
I figured you already heard.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
I'm fine, fine.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
On what you pay me?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
You and Mel Gordon?
Could be.
Where's Jill?
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
It's just...
Hi honey.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
I know who it is.
Good. Who?
Mel Gordon.
I still don't understand --
For a while.
Okay. She's fine.
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Said what?
I'm sorry.
Yeah. I mean that.
Tonight. Let's get together.
Okay.
Jack doesn't need money.
You knew me as a kid.
Good.
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
Think they're alright?
Of course! I would've heard.
How?
Wade.
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
You're not using it today?
When did she die?
Is...? She's dead then?
Can --?
How's that?
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
What?
The other guy.
Where... how'd you hear that?
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
He got his deer yet?
Atta-go.
You no-good pup!
You remember Margie Fogg?
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
In the living room.
Love! I'm made of love!
Call it what you want.
Everything you know is from me.
Bang!
You and me.
Wade?
No shit.
You think Jack shot him?
Well, it was an accident.
Huh?
The night before the shooting.
How was she?
No thanks. I don't drink.
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
That it wasn't an accident.
Then who shot him?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
Yeah, no duh.
Don't you even want to ask?
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
Back at The Fishbowl?
That's not really the point.
Yes dear?
Jim... for godsake!
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
Hey, you guys back already?
It was the experience of a lifetime.
Daddy...
Alice... I...
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
Got it.
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
He's busy being dead.
I'm doing what I can.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Stay cool.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
This doesn't make sense.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.
To swear you in as President.
Yes, Mr. President.
Because it is my duty.
My loyalty was never to my country.
Ga get it.
How many others killed?
Nine.
Any of us?
A secret service agent. It must be.
why did they do that?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Well it worked.
Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
Tower, here.
I guess it depends on your perspective.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
I know he left you behind.
My husband is a very courageous man.
Why? Do you enjoy it?
How can you? I mean they're people.
Say something dear.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Jim...
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
One thing I've learned as
Hold on, Alice.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
Yes, sir.
That isn't necessary.
No, Mr. President.  It can't.
What?
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
Please... don't start with me.
Both of you.
Flying the plane.
Excuse me?
The fax machines.
No. I thought about this, Mr.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
Where's my family?
We're handling it, sir.
But...
Two... THREE. GO!
This is the President.
Yeah, right.
Thank you for calling the white House...
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
That's my job.
Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Sir...
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
We're hooked. Hove into position.
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
That just doesn't make any sense.
I was reading too.
What's the story?
Commissioner, Aquarius.
Yes I did...
Felt like a large asteroid.
Dunn.
Accelerators down.
Sir?
You better take this.
Te...!
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Ask Simon.
Let me by, Elaine.
Not now, Elaine!
Ted!
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
What word would you use, Elaine?
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
Ted!
Elaine, what's going on?
Ted, there's no time to explain.
Not now, Elaine.
That might be the news we've been waiting for.
That's right -- premature ejection.
What will happen to him, Ted?
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Now!
Compute!
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
I guess this is a first for you.
No, I've been excited before.
So mentally ill?
I think so.
That's my girl.
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
That's not possible.
You have great tits.
We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
Can I hold him?
Sure.
He's a boy dog.
Yeah.
I don't want to hear that word!
What...?
I'm sure.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
Just poached on toast.  Over.
Poached!  Not over!  Over!
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
Sixteen 'C', why?
He's carrying a bomb.
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
All right, it's a matter of death.
Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
Don't try to stop me!
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.
No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Thank you. Cream?
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
Surely you can't be serious.
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Surely there must be something you can do.
I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
I can't tell.
Well...not for another two hours.
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
He had fish.
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
I love you.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
And a little ice.
And a little ice!
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
Uh-huh.
Hello.
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Good-bye, darling.
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
What is it?
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
I'm Randy.
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Okay, this is one of my favorites.
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Huh?
Huh?
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
No, why don't you take care ot it?
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
Yes?
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
Yeah...
That's right.
Yes...
Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
He didn't recognize me.
Here?
Do it!
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
And that fits?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
And still it fits?
Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
Why'd I do what?
At the end of the bar.
Back off, George.
But I-- .
I'll handle it.
Screw me?  That can't be right.
Your mother mates out of season.
Stay back!  I'm okay.
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
This is mole.  It's good.
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.
Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
You are married?
Was.  Divorced.
Ta ss'trakyona'...
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it.
To the... to the beach?
Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
Why?
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Nothing.
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
We all did.
I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
Fuck procedure.
Ss-ai!
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
Do what?!  George-- ?!
... It's Harcourt.
Harcourt is dead.
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
You understand that.  But how many others will?
You look very good.
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up...
What's that?
Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
You?
It is. 
Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
Whatever gave you that idea?
Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.
I can't!  Do you mind!
I'll cover you!  Get outta there!!
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Position?
Can't lock up...
Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
How long until it blows?
What?
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
Well, thanks, I --
Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
Hear me out...
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
Dead on all channels.
The structure seems intact.  They have power.
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
I don't know.
Proceed inside.
Shut up.  Just shut up!
They're but off!  Do something!
Yes, Hicks?
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
Sure, Hicks.
Not that tunnel, the other one!
Do it!
Let's get these things lit.
Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
Fuckin' A!
On my way.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Stand back.
We ain't going anywhere.
Don't be long, Ellen.
Anytime.  Anywhere.
You're just reading me.
Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
Uh, what's next?
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
Seal the door.
They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
It's readin' right.  Look!
Terrible.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
What about me?
Cross my heart.
And hope to die?
I'm sorry, Newt.
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Why do they tell little kids that?
Did you ever have a baby?
Yes.  A little girl.
Gone.
You mean dead.
Wah...?  Where are...?
Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.
Look!
Right here, baby.  Right here.
That's right.
Can we dream?
Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
Sweet Jesus.
What do you mean?
How do you know?
In a harem.
A brothel.
Oh!
A Turkish brothel.
You might be disappointed.
Why?
Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
The marriage!
You were sublime.
What did you think of the music?
Meaning you didn't like it.
What?
Don't bother.
I'll be right back.
I'm so relieved.
What??
I want to go!
Where?
Yes!
What are you talking about?
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Why? People fart backwards.
Do you think that's funny?
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
No, I'm not playing this game.
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
What?
Tish-I'm-tee.
Eat
Oh, leave me alone.
Well, don't do that again!
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
Tell them to go!
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
Yes!
Wolfi, I think your father's tired. I'll cook us something here.
What does she want?
I don't know.
Well, ask her!
Yes, my love?
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
What?
Your father is dead.
Why not? Half the house!
No one.
I heard voices.
Why not?
You'd think I was mad.
Why?
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
I can't write it!
Why not?
I understand.
No, sir. This is my own idea.
Yes.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
Tonight?
Alone.
What for?
What do you mean?
Isn't it obvious?
And I'm asking you -
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
Not at all.
He's doing his best.
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
Oh, yes.
When, may I ask?
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
Be careful!
Adorable!
Behold!
Hey!
Behold!
Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
Gertrude!
You can't be Herr Mozart!
Michael!
Yes. He is a little strange.
Ah, now! Here she comes.
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
Who was your teacher?
Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
It's just a trifle, of course.
May I try it?
Majesty.
Ah-ha!
Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
Yes?
And the result satisfies.
Well. There it is.
Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
I think so, Sire, yes.
And German?
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
Would you tell me why?
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Well. There it is.
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Yes, what about him?
He's here.
Am I not welcome?
I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
It couldn't be better.
That's not what I hear.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
How many pupils do you have?
Yes.
Yes.
How many?
This one will.
Oh, let's not talk about it.
Why not?
It's a secret.
You don't have secrets from me.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
This is just a game, Papa.
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
Mine?
She does. She says I sleep all day.
Yes, thank you, sir.
Bene! Bene!
Do any pupils come to the house?
Not that I've seen.
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
In there, sir.
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
I don't know. He has pains.
Are you Herr Mozart?
That's right.
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
Sssh! Stay here.
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
I liked the horse.
Wolfi!
Put it down!
What is this?
Can I see it?
No.
Why not?
Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
My answer is no, Mozart.
Mio caro Adone.
Ah!
But this is absurd!
Did you like it, then?
How could I not?
So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
Do you have a daughter?
I'm afraid not.
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
I can't say. Really
Thank you! Oh, thank you.
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!
How could I not?
Did my work please you?
Yes?
A Mass for the dead.
What dead? Who is dead?
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
No, no. I have to get back. I have -
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
I do.
No! No, it's him!
Who?
The man. He's here.
What man?
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
Do you believe in it?
What?
Strange!
Come. Let's begin.
Yes.
So now - A minor. Suddenly.
What time?
Common time.
Sing it back.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
With the tenors.
Also identical?
Show me.
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Yes!
You go fast!
Do you have it?
Yes.
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I am so ashamed.
What for?
Exactly.
Just let me tell you how it begins.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
Taking out what you should never have put in.
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
What is what?
Is the Emperor angry with me?
On the contrary.
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
No, but I'm the best.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Here in Vienna.
Then you must know this.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
And do they believe it?
Is it true?
Do you believe it?
Should I?
He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
No? Was Mozart a good man?
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
No, you didn't!
I poisoned his life.
But not his body.
What difference does that make?
Exactly.
You must be mad.
I've seen the manuscript.
Where?
Never mind.
Incredible.
About the ballet.
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Yes, in the third act.
Well done, Sire!
What? Who the devil are you?
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
Well, promise then.
What do you mean - now?
Excuse me, my dear.
Yes, I am looking after him.
Can we come in?
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
But he's all right?
I'll call tomorrow.
How did he look?
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
Go about your duties.
Yes, Doctor.
Yes, Doctor?
He said 'Jack'.
Yes, I believe he did.
Come to my office, Miss Price.
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
What did he say?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
The zoo? Is he rational?
Is David acting strangely?
No, not really.
Yes, I should think so.
He's fine. We'll come right over.
Shall I send a car?
No, a cab will be faster.
I expect you shortly.
Tea would be nice.
I beg your pardon?
It was a wolf.
What?
A wolf.
Yes?
You haven't eaten your lunch.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
Call me Alex.
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
Will you give me a break?
I thought you were asleep.
I was. What are you reading?
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
I dream of death mostly.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
That's not really a very proper question.
How old are you?
Twenty-eight.
I'm twenty-seven.
I know.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
My best friend. My very best friend.
Shall I read to you?
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
What?
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
A werewolf?
I'll let you know the next full moon.
You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
Your dead friend Jack?
I would think so.
Yeah, I would think so, too.
Very nice.
Charming.
Bathroom.
Lovely.
The bedroom.
There is only one bed.
It's nice to see you.
Yes?
Good.
I wasn't hallucinating.
That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
Do me an enormous favor?
Anything.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
Yeah, I do, but go to work.
A doper werewolf.
See you later.
I should be committed.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
Pull over.
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
David, let's go now.
Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me!
No what?
No.
No.
Right.
No.
No what?
No!
I thought not.
I think he's a Jew.
Why on earth do you say that?
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
You did, did you?
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
There's no call for that kind of language.
That's what I want you to do, you moron!
Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
Oh, come on, tell us.
No. You've had your chance.
I was having a nightmare.
What are you going to see?
You're in a hospital in London.
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
So they said.
Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
Yes.
Good.
David.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Shall we?
Nice to see you.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Look at that.
It's a five-pointed star.
Maybe the owners are from Texas.
You ask them.
Wrong.
You ask them.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Apparently so.
Come on, I'm freezing.
I have no idea.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
I heard that.
What was it?
A coyote.
There aren't any coyotes in England.
Pecos Bill.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
No, but he was on the moors.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
I don't know. Come on.
Come on, where?
It's circling us.
Plan?
Let's just keep walking.
Do you think it's a dog?
Walk away, Jack.
No.
Not far enough. Come on.
Yeah.
Where are we going?
I'll tell you when we get there.
Are you going to help me up?
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Thanks a lot.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
I can't stand it.
Life mocks me even in death.
David!
What?!
I'm not listening!
What?!
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
I wanted to see you.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Get out of here, Jack!
What do you think?
Hi, David.
You don't have to say anything.
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
If I was still alive, I probably would.
Thank you.
How shall I do it?
What here?
He's on the telephone.
Campari and soda would do nicely.
I suppose Guinness will suffice.
Oh.
I beg your pardon?
I'd like some tea, please.
I don't rightly know, sir.
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
Yeah - sure!
Matt?
Yeah.
About twenty-four thousand.
Here's twenty-five thousand.
Let me have ten bucks?
Yeah?
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
Yes, sir.
What about?
I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?
The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
That's very simple. I was home.
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
You understand?
Why, of course.
All right, Jack, all right.
They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
That don't do us any good.
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
We can take blood from anything   If it's comin' to us.
You don't have to do nothing.
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!
Why, I needed a
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Well, what?
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
Don't you know?
No.
My apartment.
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
A misunderstood bachelor.
I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
What are you doing here?
Yes, sir.
Yes, now.
I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
John, how's your wife this morning?
Much better this morning, thank you.
Got a handkerchief?
I'm feeling fine this morning.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Of course, let them in! You're late now.
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
Hello, darling.
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
No.
Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Now don't you worry about it.
Good morning.
Mr. Sampson . . .
All right. Send him in.
Yes?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Got my letter?
Yes, thank you.
Hello, Helen.
I haven't any.
You haven't got a uniform?
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
There you are.
You're protecting somebody.
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
What are you talking about?
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
Did you get the case for the securities?
Absolutely.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
He's at a board meeting.
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
Matt, come here!
Why?
Come here, honey!
Oh, is that so?
With what?
The ten dollars.
Oh, ten dollars
Yes.
Oh, you think I'm lying?
Yes.
I tell you, I saw them!
Oh, Charlie again.
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
All right, dear.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
They must have turned him down.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Yes, why?
He was in the bank yesterday.
He was here?
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
Are you sure?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
Huh?
It couldn't have been earlier?
No. It wasn't earlier because...
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
You used to carry a gun, didn't you?
I don't know.
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
I'm okay, Matt.
You've got enough?
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
I guess so.
Where's Charlie?
I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
Jim Younger, I told you--
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Now you tell us.
Never a good thing.
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.
Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
You stay out of this, Bob.
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
What have you done?
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Swear.
I swear --
Swear on Jimmy's grave.
It's tougher than it looks.
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Nope.
Then I love it.
Tomorrow.
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
He's planning a job.
What?
I think I recognize you.
How?
What's going on?
I could use the walk.
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
You're not scared, are you?
What is wrong with you?
She got two of them.
She was European!
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
Let's ride.
Sorry.
Don't let it happen again.
I got three.
What will be?
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
That's it.
And I'm the better outlaw.
A trap.
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Pass me some whisky.
I'm out.
Missed you too, cousin.
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
I'm thinking...
Both would be nice.
Which one, right or left?
The brown one.
Sadie was not a man!
Ah.
They gonna rush us?
They're just insurance in case we run.
Of course!  Uh, sir?
What?
Where is Jesse James?
This here is the Younger Gang!
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
The District Marshall
Then why can't I go in there?
On account of we're robbing it.
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
Fine. I'll just wait here.
I'd appreciate that.
What is it?
I had you covered.  From back there.
My little Web did that?
Died a hero.
Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
Such as?
I figure.
Hell of a war.
We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
You're doing just fine.
Maybe, maybe...
You can shut up now.
You are a charmer.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
Next time try "fat and haggard."
What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
Ma.
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
Fine. How'd it go out here?
We're gonna have to talk...
And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
The posters?
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
Jesse, we're outlaws.
And we're good at it.
If I could go back to farming --
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
Oh yeah.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
Yeah, Jimmy?
They're making him a hero now.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
So what was he?
Yeah Jimmy?
Everything but the boring parts.
A fair number, Ma.
Say your prayers?
Boys?
Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
Shush.
You were little Jesse James when you left.
But you got big!
Mmmm.
Nuh-huh ...
No! I mean, of course not. No.
Teasing you is completely unfair.
What?
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
And what's this right girl like?
Little ones.
I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.
Let the law --
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
"Hmm" what?
Swimming. Swimming is good.
What?
I'll explain on the way.
But I like the presidential suite.
Mmm.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.
Was it worth it?
I'm not hanged yet.
You cocky little bastard.
Ahh, you'll miss me.
Right here in church?
Communion.
You been with a girl ever?
This time we'll make an exception.
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
Not at all.
I just though you were awful cute.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Lyla Devereux.
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
I'm doing you folks a favor --
Move you fools!
Just perfect.
I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
We did.
I look forward to seeing it.
Sir?
What is that?
What, sir?
I remember you.
Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
It's going to be a long winter.
It's going to be a long spring.
No.
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
On a lot of lithium?
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Yes?
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
I can't.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Dorsia's nice.
Nice?
Eight?
Pick me up?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Yes.
This is Dorsia?
Yes, dear.
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
Pull out.
I'm ignoring you.
Pull out, goddamnit!
What do you want, Courtney?
Turn the light on.
Why?
Oh God, just get it over with.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
You and...Luis?
Yes, Courtney?
Yes?
Nothing.
You just haven't been looking.
Would you like to see my apartment?
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
Alright.
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
It's not that nice.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Evelyn?
Is your Evian spiked?
We should do it.
No-I can't take the time off work.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
He's rich.
Everybody's rich.
He's good-looking.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
He has a great body
Everybody has a great body now.
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
It's not.
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
We never really shared one.
You're inhuman.
I'm just leaving.
But where?
I have to return some videotapes.
How did you guess?
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
No.
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
No, he doesn't.
Are you sure?
You saw the ad in the Times?
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
I won't...don't worry.
The message you left.
Why not, you stupid bastard?
Now, if you'll excuse me.
It looks so soft.
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Jesus lives, Luis.
Where are you going?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
What? CARRUTHERS  I'll call you.
It looks that way, doesn't it?
Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.
Maybe it's just the light.
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
New card. What do you think?
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
Leaving what?
This.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.
Oh really? That's great.
I said we are totally booked.
Two at nine? Perfect.
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
After six.
Negative. Cancel it.
Just...say...no.
Just say no?
Thanks, Patrick.
Ye-es, Je-an?
Can you bring Mr...
Yes, Patrick?
Oh no. I have no plans.
Well, isn't this a coincidence.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
You didn't give them a name.
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
Interesting.
Forget it.
What's that?
Jean? What?
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Patrick? Is that you?
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Where are you?
Jean-I'm not-
Patrick? I can't hear you.
What are I doing?
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
Why?
Just...say...no!
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!
What do you think I do?
A model? An actor?
No. Flattering, but no.
Well...
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
Yeah.
She's from...France.
Who?
Paul Owen.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Does he do this all the time?
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
No. I'm okay.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
No, I'm okay.
Oh no, I'm okay.
It's no problem
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
No, really. I'm okay.
How old are you?
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Where did you go to school?
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Your address?
Thanks.
You seem...nervous.
I know. I'm sorry.
You sure?
No problem. 
What do you mean...Yale thing?
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Do you feel that way?
No. Not really.
Where did Paul hang out?
Hang...out?
Yeah. You know...hang out.
No, he just hung out there.
And where did he go to school?
We were both seven in 1969.
So was I.
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
But...has anyone seen him in London?
Hmmm.
Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.
Had his apartment been burglarized?
People just...disappear.
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
Wait. That's not what I've got.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Let's see...  That you were with-
Well, I could he wrong.
Not a big music fan, eh?
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
Not in the mood, I guess.
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
I've questioned him.
Marcus?
Yes.
I checked it out. It's clean.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
Where was Marcus?
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
So who was he with?
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
I'm so hungry.
Listen, what's your name?
Al.
Speak up. Come on.
Al.
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
It's...it's...all right.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
Oh well, you know.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
Cecelia is, well...you know 
Yes, Owen?
Is that a raincoat?
Yes, it is.
Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
'Gonna wait outside.
You know what I mean.
I can paint anywhere.
Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
Didn't you visit the campus?
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
You saved my life in alot of ways.
We're not gonna let it.
I know, I know.
You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
Teddy was killed last night.
It was a hate crime.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
You think I don't know that?
Milo. Why would he --
You can't just walk in, either.
So you believe me?
Nothing?
Remember Lyle Barton?
Poor baby. You know that's not true.
...Different?
What?
Don't we have any chopsticks?
Oh, right. Hold on.
Great.
It's gonna get cold.
Right. Wait. A toast.
That'll be a test, won't it?
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
Have a seat.
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
And Outpost? You're happy there?
Yes sir.
'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
Gimme the coordinates?
Is it your dish?
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
We tried!
Oh hi.
He's pretty tight with his family.
We could move 'em up here.
Oh. No thanks.
There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
...Do I?
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
That's what I told her. My wife.
Maybe I'm going too fast.
You're making me young again.
Right... Right.
What're you implying.
Nothing!
Definitely.
Were the flags for Teddy?
Talk about work? Never!
I meant did you find other stuff to --
You've been coming in early.
34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
You look a little tired.
I'm okay. It's going well!
'Have a look?
Sure.
'Sorry about the late notice...
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
Maybe we should all get on it.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
Just do what I'm asking!
Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
Let's go.
Longitude 109 --
Wait... He knows.
What?
Just do it.
In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
You do?
I mean, it's your life.
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
We'll come up with the next big thing.
...You wanna work -- here?
Got out of my other commitment.
Keep looking.
What're we looking for?
Any irregularity in the pattern.
I'm calling Gary.
Where we going?
You know my name.
You know mine.
You're famous around here.
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
No. Please.
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
She saved my life.
Why would you do a thing like --
They'd frame him.
He's out of prison?
Hmm?
What?
I don't know --
Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
What'd he say?
"A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"
Thank God.
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
You'll come up with something.
Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
Bring it to the other location.
But you said the other --
Let's try #2.
What?
Uh. Not exactly.
What? Come on. Is it serious?
I don't know.
Did you tell Alice?
Oh we're not going to the campus.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
Speaking of which...
Yeah, yeah.
Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
I could get it out of him.
You're not listening.
Where is he?
We're too late. Take a look.
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
Groovy.
Or sometimes not at all.
Care for some saki?
Sak-i it to me!
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
To my health.
Kiss me.
Yes.
Hey, how are you?
Hungry.
Thank you.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Be careful.
Thank you.  Let's go, baby!
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Be careful.
Thanks.
Be careful.
Where is Vanessa, by the way?
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
There's one more thing, Austin.
Be careful.
Thank you.
Excuse me?
What?
That's not your mother, that's a man!
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
Yes, Basil?
Be careful.
Thanks.
Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.
Austin, I have something for you as well.
Be careful!
Well, you can't always get what you want.
Groovy!
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
Why not? It's a question.
Love is... love is... love is...
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
Man, you are one chilly square!
My wedding tackle.
I'm sorry?
My meat and two veg.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
What?
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
Let me see.
How do you know?
I never forget a pussy... cat.
He's too well-protected right now.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
I couldn't have another bite.
Why?
No, this is me in a nutshell.
I am not.
Oh, yes you are.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
No, did you use a condom?
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
You know who.
Not now, Austin.
Fair enough.
Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.
Don't worry!
Lay it on me.
I love you, Austin.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
Danger's my middle name.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Hey, wait a minute--
Here, have a piece of gum.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.
What's its current position?
That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.
Yes.  Scott!
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
Right.
They're mutated sea bass.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
Please allow me to demonstrate.
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
What did you say?
Show me.
Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
How's Austin?
He's asleep.
You didn't...
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
We don't judge here.
I don't wanna take over the family business.
No, he's really evil.
Scott.
OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Red ...
... head ...
Love...
... death ...
... power ...
... preserve...
Secret ...
... love...
... love ...
Fear ...
... love ...
Peter ...
Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
Have we met?
You mean you don't recall??
Promised? Who promised?
There, look!
Mr. John Steed, please.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Impossible?
As you see.
Then you can't come in.
I have an appointment.
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Really -- what happened in 1922?
Eh? In here!
We have met ...
Rules are made to be broken.
Then who wins?
Looks like rain, Steed...
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
We want to help...!
A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...
Next assignment?
Thanks, Valentine ...
An unholy trinity ...
You killed my husband.
But -- why?
Oh, no, Emma. They've only just begun ...
Valentine, listen to me ...
Choices?
I'll never marry you.
I had a spot of bother at the door.
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
Mother?
We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
I had a feeling you would. Touche!
Yes indeed. I need protection.
Thank you, Trubshaw ...
That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
For a man in my position --
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
I meant me.
Small talk.  Try the weather.
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
Did you say formal? I must dress.
How on earth can you tell?
Any ideas?
Is that written in his shoe?
She had this in her mouth. There, there...
Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
Is there anything that isn't?
That's what we were working on.
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
To kill me?
Nothing personal.
No trouble.
Always.  Except ...
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
Not for a moment.
You're playing games.
I thought you played by the rules.
I thought you didn't.
Winning isn't everything.
You don't trust me?
As far as you trust me.
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
You'll find out.
You didn't tell her?
It's called Black Leather.
Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
Shall we?
Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
Where are you going?
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
What kept you?
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Still a bit chilly ...
As a matter of fact I have ...
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Pity your mother came, too ...
Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
Half-brother to be precise.
Makes two of us.
Getting to what?
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
I shall need a small plane.
You're not venturing alone, surely.
We want Mrs. Peel.
Dead, I'm afraid.
How did you guess?
Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
Possibly. Split personality ...
Insane ... ?
Mother and Father know best.
In your operation.
I think so, thank you so much ...
I feel sure of it.
Both, actually.
This way ...
Walk over to the window ...
Let it be rain, please let it be --
Stay by the window. By the window.
Perish the thought.
I was at Harrow ...
But did they teach you this?
That's not playing by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
If you say so.
I do.
Did I? My mistake.
You are, and it's behind you.
Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for --
Debbie's marrying Rick.
...Really?
Really -- you went with him for two years.
Check out the other guy's buns.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
Yeah. What is it?
You're kidding.
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
Bond... James Bond.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Five thousand dollars.
No.
Not interested.
Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
Oh, come on, just a little.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
The best.
I love that car.
I'm very happy for you two.
Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
So does Debbie.
Maybe it had something to do.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
Mr. Thomerson.
Fine. How's everything going?
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
Thank you, sir.
I've tried to change her mind.
Keep me informed.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.
But a fabulous cook.
What are we having?
Are you going to have women at your party?
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Oh... I got something for that.
What's the matter?
I don't know... I just feel scared.
Good...
Um... that's very relaxing.
Can't I just go with you guys?
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
You're really pissing me off.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
Why don't you get undressed.
Rick, you're lying!
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
You're on.
Yeah.
Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.
I know what I'm doing... Go!
Ilene, we don't really know that.
Well... hope she'll be very happy.
I think I screwed that one once.
Okay. Nice to meet you both.
What are you talking about, asshole?
Your whores never showed up.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
What are you...
That's more like it.
Screw you...
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
Yes.
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
You're a pimp?
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
I want women.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
Good.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
I just want to be alone.
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
Yeah, I guess so.
Really?
I couldn't find any razor blades.
All right, who serves?
Rick!
Oh, no!
No. Let's at least finish the set.
The phone made me do it!
You've been having strange sex...!
It's all right...  So have I.
Mrs.?
I'm separated.
Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
Then it's on to the real thing.
C'mon. I insist.
My gift to you.
Under the table!
The best table in the house.
So long, Father.
About what?
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
Right in there, pal.
I don't know.
What's this?
Got me.
Still drawing a blank.
Take care.
Who's your friend?
I'm saved. Let's party!
Debbie.
My Debbie?
What's with her costume?
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
Be gentle.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
Yeah...
We're gonna be okay, man...
Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
He's alive.
Just come down, John. Just --
Who asked you?
It's comin' along... want a beer?
In the Field Museum once.
It works.
Sheep don't count.
Yeah? What about Laura --
That was never proved.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
I'm in heaven, Lt.
Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
-- Never mind.
Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
Hey.
Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
Yeah... too bright...
What, are you kidding? By myself?
Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.
Thanks for the insight.
Brian, look --
Just leave me alone, okay?
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
So hello.
Saw what?
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
Oh shut up, huh?  I think I broke my goddamn arm...
Jennifer.
You're back.
You look great.
Thanks for calling.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
Yeah? What have you been up to?
I work for city hall.
Really? No kidding.
When I was twenty.
Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
How's it going?
Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
You think that's really any of your business?
Well, you did invite me here.
Marty did.  But I wanted you to come to.
Got anything to drink in there?
Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.
I wanted to be a good one.
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
Hi.
You could check. It'd be in his files.
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Just take it.
That's a dumb thing to say.
You're right.
What'll you do?
It's a small town.
I don't have a story.
Sure you do.
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
Pest control.
What are you listening to?
I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM!
Yeah.
Did I say thanks?
No.
Just wondering.
You look like... Brian.
Four months?
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Nice boat.
What the hell are we waiting for?
Engine 115, right?
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Coffee sucked.
Cute.
Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
I'm busy.
He just wants to --
-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
I'll be there.
They're waitin' man.
I'll be there, goddamn it!
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
Fixing my roof.
It's not your roof anymore.
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
He's going to be a fireman.
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
Sorry I hit Jackson.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
He treats you okay?
Okay.
I treated you better.
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
Yeah? When was the last time?
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
There's something else kinda interesting...
McCaffrey, hold this for us.
Didn't think you'd make it.
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
He works for me.
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
You like everybody, Ronald.
I know you.
Tell him about me, Shadow?
Absolutely.
And old ladies?
-- Burn them.
And the world -- the whole world.
-- Burn it all.
The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.
What do you listen to, Stephen?
You don't know... nobody knows...
I need that report, Lt.
Investigator Rimgale.
Alderman.
No Marty, I don't.
Holcomb? I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet.
Just catch the son of a bitch.
Investigator...
Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
Those fucking Mob assholes.
Yes.
I was gonna bring it back myself.
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
I forgive you.
I want 15 on the Mets.
How about 7 1/2?
Yeah. I'm sure.
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
Don't bullshit me.
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
What case?
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
B-L-A-K it is.
I'm on it.
Did he gots to be.
Yo Black, you looking for trouble.
Ho!
Louder.  They can't hear you.
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Give me some?
BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
Yeah, him.
What do you do?
I'm a revolutionary.
Why are you smiling so?
She's also moorish.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
Must be the pressure.
In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.
Look at my lips.
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
I'm out.
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
You can walk away.  We both can.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
De-la-croix.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
Manray needs a job.
You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
And this is Manray.
That can be done.
Did we get our bill yet?
And I'm the feet.
DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
Some tap dancing, some singing.
Where do I sign?
You're now Mantan.
Mantan!!
How you sound?
I won't do it anymore.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
Exactly!
Yep, you guessed it.
This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
We think so.
Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
I want to speak with you.
It's me, Peerless.
It's been a long time.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
Always keep 'em laughing.
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
Manray!
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
Do you know how you will use him?
Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
You getting cold feet?
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
This is Cheeba.
Which one is your brother?
The big one.
What do you want me to say?
Just don't lie to me.
The pleasure is mine.
I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
For what?
I thought it was appropiate.
I don't want to hear it.
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
He's just playing big brother.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
Please don't go there.
And that's how you got me in the first place.
I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's "LAUGH-IN."
Naw.  I'll take the zero.
You feel good, not nervous?
I feel fine.
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
You sound like the media.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
What you did is dead wrong.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
I said no such thing.  All I said is that something must be wrong.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
I'll be right over.
Yes he did.
Where is he?
I can't go all the way down south.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
Not at all?
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
This is a TV show, not a music video.
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
The best defense is offense.
Thank you.  And always smile.
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
So what's up with you and DeLa?
What do you mean?
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
...the big apple, New York, New York.
To come back to our roots.
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
The one with da big...
Not her, the one with the little...
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
I thought you got rid of...
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
...yes she did.
...I heard different, thought that was...
...not that time...
...then what about...
...perfect...
...like grits and butter...
...like fried and chicken...
You slept too near where you got in?
I slept too near where I fell out.
You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
I don't know who I am.
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
A song a comin' I feel.
Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
Enough.
What do you want to know?
The good stuff.
Oh you do, huh?
Just a little something' somethin'.
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
Never read a book in my whole life.
Maybe you need to start.
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
We can look out for ourselves.
For what?  He left.  Not me.
My people love me.
What?
You look beautiful like that.
And what?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Just ask me what you want to know.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Say what, Manray?
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
Don't try to change to the subject.
Why don't you answer?
I know I won't be your puppet.
You can go now.
I wuz leaving anyway, for good.
That is none of your business.
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
I never was more in earnest.
O'Grady.
The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers.
I have acted as I think fit.
Sir, I'm a British officer.
Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
Your cousins go out with him.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
You are going to drive to the frontier.
Your honor must lower his voice.
All Europe shall hear of this!
As you please.
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
Yes, sir.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
For whom else have you worked?
Only the agency of servants.
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
I believe they will deport you.
I have faced that problem before.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
Have you had one?
Never.
Not even that.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
It is my only object.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
Then you must get it.
With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
As much as possible?
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
All the same, you must name an amount.
It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
All right, five hundred guineas.
Yes!
The Prince left him only that choice.
What is to be done?
Yes, of course.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Good night, my little darling.
Papa?
Yes?
Is he all right, papa?
Yes, he's fine.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Dark Valdez.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
He is only curious to know who you are.
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
It's ten thirty in the morning.
Yeah, if you've slept.
Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?
Who?
What do we do?
Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
Fine.
Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
Can anybody hear me!
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
I don't know!
Shut up, Mueller.
Shut up.  West's dead.
I asked for a policeman.
I just don't like it.
What do you like then?
They're dead, aren't they?
I'm not telling you what happened.
Tell me about them.
That'd be my reaction too --
He's lying.
Yeah, we know, Pike did.
You saw West's body.
Of course --
Yeah --
But not Pike's.
You wanna bet?
Do what?
Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
The creek bed --
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
Your weapons, Sergeant.
West... he's dead.
So did we. Why didn't you come?
I...
West's. Any kindling for afire?
We just want to check your pack --
Yeah...
You hated West more than any of us.
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
You're the only one missing a grenade.
Mueller.
Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
Look in my pack.
Why?
Just look. Little pocket.
Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
Full clip to the body --
From up close or far away?
What don't you know?
But not the only victim, right?
I didn't kill him --
Then who did?
No. Poetic justice, though.
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
Because I was standing next to him.
Where are they!
Maybe --
MAYBE WHAT --
Maybe he...
And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
Home, I'm done.
What about the confession?
Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
The Senator...
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
You knew Sergeant West?
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Yes.
Move him.
Why?
Is Dunbar cute?
That is the most unprofessional --
Something like that.
You made me look like an idiot --
You're right. We should sit in silence.
We're in the middle of a murder case --
You're off to a late start.
Not the happiest of memories?
I don't think that has anything to do with --
I don't know.
Watch me.
What?
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
Little bit.
Let's go talk to Bill...
They got their stories straight.
What?
Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
You couldn't have known --
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
You wanted to get the truth.
Yeah.
So did I.
Nah.
That's gonna stay my secret.
Good, just making sure.
Get in.
Isn't this how your story goes?
No death certificates. No crime.
Seven.
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Nah.
Want company?
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
Oh, you remember now --
So you took off your shirt?
No one else heard it?
He whispered it in my ear.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
But you didn't see it, right?
What.
Wrong answer --
Childs.
Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
What the fuck are you doing?
I used it to start the fire --
We're not going anywhere.
You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right.
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
Then it's unofficial.
No --
It's too neat.
The army kicked you out for drugs...
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
Good luck, kid.
Edward Bloom.
Yes.
Not yet.
Why?
I don't expect to.
Fine, you do it.
I brought it.
Let's see it.
Don.
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
Thirty years. Maybe more.
How would you describe him?
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
What did she look like?
Well, she... uh...
Was she nekkid?
Eighteen.
I suspect it will hurt a lot.
I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
How did you know?
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
I see. I thank you for your time.
I can get it. I can just...
Please. Go. Just go.
I'll...
Go.
I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
I was dreaming.
What were you dreaming about?
Can I take your picture?
Well, it's not a short one.
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
You were talking about your wedding.
And I like you.
Karl.
Okay.
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
Am I?
You learned from the best.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
She was a witch.
Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
You owe me three-fifty.
Really.
True story.
There's a lot you don't know about me.
You know where the chemicals are?
Oh, so you know.
Son?
Can we talk?
What?
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
How I go.
Okay. Okay.
You say...
The River!
They're your favorite flower.
How did you get so many?
Go out with me.
There is no softer ground than town.
I can't imagine any place better than here.
I'm robbing this place.
'Fraid so.
Hello.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'll help you.
I need to lie down for a bit.
I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
I do.
Probably tonight.
You don't have to.
I'm going with you.
They met at Auburn.
Mmm, what?
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
I need you on my side.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
He's up with your father.
You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
Yes. But that's a different...
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
Do you know who that is?
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
You know what for.
No I don't.
There's over eighty thousand here.
What do you mean?
Yes.
We'll stop then.
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
That's not a burn.
It is. I did it cooking.
Yeah.
Thank you.
What are you doing here?
Uh... Yes.
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
He says he feels safe here.
Yes. I know.
Good. 
And...
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
You must have a visa or something...
You're asking for my documents?
Uh. Do you like England?
Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
Oh nothing.
Tell me.
No. It is too judgmental.
Tell me what he said.
Do you believe in love?
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
You can stay tonight.
John.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
He wants the money from your bank.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
Leave her alone.
Yes.
Right. Okay. Good.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
Yes.
Yes.
Sorry?
Happy bath day.
Syevodnya
Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.
Yes I know.
What's wrong?
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
They go.
I don't want to know.
In the world.
I do. I want to very badly.
So you're just going to be vindictive
In every sense. If at all possible.
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
What?
What? No you're not..
No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
What?
I don't have any money.
I don't want to talk about him.
It's none of your business.
Excuse me?
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
Shut up. I'm not listening.
You don't want to talk about it.
And. It's wrong.
And who says what is wrong.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
Sometimes which?
Sometimes neither.
Some... What does that mean?
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
You...
You didn't mind too much.
You don't understand you either.
Get out
You are throwing me out.
Get out.
What? I... I wasn't saying...
Please, there's no... Oh.
I wasn't saying anything.
Well what have you got?
Have you had any before?
No.
Are you scared?
Not really. Maybe a little.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
Laugh it up.
I've got news for you. It's not working.
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
Except for Small Eyes.
Except for Small Eyes.
What was her name?
What's your name?
No. I think I better just go.
Okay. Thank you.
Whatever.
Please. Why not?
Because it was a lie.
Goodbye.
Okay. Promise?
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
I'm sorry.
Please.
It's not mine either.
It's what you came back for.
No. What? No. I know.
It's more like a date.
It's a long way to go for a date.
Maybe you will find out.
Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
Thanks.
Just wanted to see.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh! Gave me a start.
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
Yes?
I need to uh...
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
You take her to a doctor?
Oh, she older than that.
Not if no one finds out.
Well. Hope you enjoy it.
You liked what I brung ya?
When? Now? Oh. No.
I need ya help again.
Can I come in?
Hey.
No, ma'am.
Well, that makes it easier.
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
Yeah.
Make yourself at home. You done it already.
I got others.
You don't got half what Tehronne got.
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
I begged him not to go. And he did.
Yeah.
Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
Better'n me?
Better than what you give.
Rose... please...
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
You better pray, gal. You better pray...
Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME!
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Or what? OR WHAT?
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
Come on, gal...
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
Well I don't...
Wait. He left.
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
Why you got me chained?
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
No ma'am.
In my house, you watch that lip...
Whose doin' is that?
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
I said... STOP!
I CAN'T!
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
Well, get to it.
You drink whiskey?
Sure.
We drinkin' buddies now?
To freedom.
No joke.
The... chain helps.
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
I'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.
Nothin'.
By myself?
You can handle it.
I guess you have.
Don't think that'd be wise.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
Get a good picture in your mind.
Well, this one's yours now. You ready to take care of it?
Maybe I won't.
Shit. Who hasn't?
Why you say that?
He tapped that.
Naw!
Go ask him.
Like I told you.
Why's his britches round his knees?
You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?
I told you to TURN BACK!
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
Then what?
We ain't here to talk about that shit.
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
Get me ten bags of mulch.
Yes'sir.
That's right.
Rae...
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
Hey.
What?
Got in a little accident.
Yeah.
I just wanted some make-up.
All that shit's on aisle 5.
Thought you had a man for that.
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
The hell you call me?
Eh, if the bootie fits...
Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.
Home.
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
Get rid of it.
-- I should tear your head off.
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Who do you think the Jap is?
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him.
Maybe we should do something?
Saving your life.
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
Where is the subway station, please.
No.
Number five with a bullet.
You didn't take, did you...?  You hear things.
In Rome, I'll bow.
Nick, we can't just --
I said let's go, Charlie.
First decent idea you've had.
You said that in the last two places.
I hope not.
Maybe we should bail?
I don't think he'd feel it.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
What'd she say?
Cool?
You all right?  You okay?
High spirits, desire, commitment.
You'll take care of that.
Give me a break, would you?
If you give me one.
Where would you look for the mafia?
That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
Give us a break...
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
Why the hell not?
I don't, that's all.
I couldn't keep up.  My shame is complete.
Yeah...
I can see that.
I stole them.
Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
Are we getting married?
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
Ichiro --
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
Good.  Very good...
You were too far behind.
I'll check it out.
Shut-up.
Not without a small army, Nicklaus- san.
A resort city, Beppu.
I want to go talk to him.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
Big enough.
It's illegal, Nick.
Let's go.  Him first.
Nick, you can't do this.
It's done.  You don't have to come.
I can't...
Kampai.
I couldn't tell.
Joyce?
We need the plate to negotiate with.
Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
A wife.  She left.
I'm sorry.
Me too.
Why's that?
Yes...
Call for help.
We can't lose.
How can you be so sure?
He gets as much as he wants.
There was a change in plans.
Gaiijin?
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
You have a helluva way of asking for help.
You have a helluva way of answering.
I don't think so.
Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
He's on duty.
I paid for that.
Where's Ich?
Unavailable.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
He drinks.
He's got a reason.
You met her.
I don't remember you saying no.
Who am I supposed to be?
The cheese...
No one's keeping him here.
What if I chant?
Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
I'm taking you back.
Guess I'm on a roll.
She's such a long way home for you.
I'm amused.
Don't be.
Then take it from him.
This by this...
Dope?
What...?  What if I say no?
He was my partner.
It is not allowed.
We're police officers.
You're foreigners.
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
Twenty-four hours, detective.
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
Goodbye, officer.
He'll be dealt with.
I'll pay you.
You want him dead too.
After a court convicts him.  He belongs to me.
We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
If he won't cooperate?
Anywhere.
Not to be trapped.
You underestimate the trap, Mary.
Then go get him.
And what can he do for you?
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Would you like to be modified?
Had in mind something a little more radical.
Death.
Come here.
Also extraordinary things.
You're just all so... so different.
You're androids.
Nexus - 6.
Like what?
Like...
You could help us.
He could?
His company made us.
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
This afternoon.
Just thought I'd...
He's not ready yet.
When?
Tomorrow, he says.
Hello, glad to meet you.
Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
You didn't like her!?
She's not with you?
Who.
Go.
Your customer, eh?
Soon as I finish the job.
When might that be?
Day after tomorrow.
Oh!  Day after tomorrow.
You start.
What about a summary then.
I think we're through for the night.
Not if it works.
And what in your estimation works?
The umbrella.
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
Longevity is classified.  No.
It's okay.  Forget it.
But I would like to buy you drink.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Thank you very much.
My pleasure.
Sorry, don't have the time.
No problem.
Ya.
Prosit.
I like you too.
One more, eh?
I gotta piss.
I don't know.
Let's hear it.
I'm taking a piss.
No rust?
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
Too old.
But if you could?
Me too.
Yes?
Can I come in?
Who?
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
For holes.
You mean the snake.
Does it eat?
Come on.
Sorry.
Why should I be?
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
Why not?
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
In your opinion.
It would be my child.
I think you need more help than you've got.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Can you?  I couldn't.
What do you want me to do?
There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
You did?
Where is he?
Dead.
Oh.
Not too good.
If they are smart, they take naps.
Yeah.  Sometimes.
I wish I could.
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
But then how can you...
I never felt better.
You mean a woman?
Uh-huh.
What's a long time?
Ten years.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Just wait here.
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
Holden got hit.
Black?
Please.
Go ahead.
The machine works.  She is.
Almost through.
Sorry.
Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.
What desert?
But how come I'd be there?
Know what a turtle is?
Of course.
Same thing.
I never seen a turtle.
I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
Pris.
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
Hi.
I don't have one.
Oh.
They left.
What about friends?
I was hoping you'd say that.
Just better.
Beautiful.
Thanks.
Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
What's that?
Is that why you're still here?
Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.
I keep a lot of provisions right here.
You're all so perfect.
Yes?
You like it?
Bravo!
Thank-Q!
I'm Adam Webber.
He's really funny!
Your mom was a dancer?
How do you do?
My office.
Well, that depends...
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
Oh, brother...
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
Are you French?
No, you get out of here.
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
You're lost?
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
Here, pick these up!
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I don't know. Why doesn't it?
Yes, I'm right?
Right.
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
Nope.
And that's it?
Yes.
What is it?!
It's Perry!
Okay, okay!  Take it easy!
Oh, I could die...
Over this?
I know a short-cut.
Take it. damn it!
Okay.
I haven't brushed yet.
Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
Thank-Q!
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Why doesn't it never work out?
Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
How long would you need me?
Two weeks.
What's the pay?
What's fair?
Who are these people?
My Mom and Dad.
Very funny, smart ass.
What?
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
I guess we'll need another locker.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Then forget it.
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
This is for me.
Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
Yes.
What for?
Because I want to get married.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
The big one!
It does?
Sure.
I didn't know that.
Everybody's divorced.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
No dogs, huh? Okay.
Two weeks.
Thank you.
The engine is still running.
Yes, ma'am!
Stop that ma'am crap!
Sorry!
I told you I've never driven before!
Never drive again!
You said it would be easy!
I was wrong!!
Is this your house?
I like it.
Thank-Q!
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
Sure.
In the house?
Uh...yeah.
So, what are you seeing?
That's boring!
Yeah.
Do I look crazy?
Yes!
I like her.
And don't be so obvious!
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
Maybe. But that's how it works.
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962--
I'm sorry.
Eve, I'm sorry.
But, Eve, I would--
Goodnight!
Well, you had better!!
Thanks.
Is that what you call it?
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
Yes, it is.
Gee-ma-nee!
Nothing.
Of course!
I've got to go, now.
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
The front door is open.  Will you be back?
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
Gerade aus dann links!
No, son. A pitcher.
No. Sit down.
Because he must!
Blow out the candles!
Your mom made that all by herself.
Merci!
Yes, father?! Yes?
...the pipe tobacco.
Yes, sir.  Is that all?
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
I promise. Is that all?
Well, in that case...of course, son.
Uh-huh.
Yes, sir. It's true.
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
You nut!
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
Really?  Since when?
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
Russia.
Juneau.
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
Sorry, that's the largest city.
Yeah.
It's so small.
You don't have a computer in your cabin?
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
That would knock my father out.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Yes. He likes windows.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
Why not? He has great pants.
I just don't want to.
Okay.
The recovery is very impressive.
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
Okay. Thank you, my friends.
No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
So, did you buy a movie?
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Goodbye.
Bye, Adam!
And thanks for always being happy!
Of what?
The hotel.
My father is a genius.
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
Thirty-five.
You don't look thirty-five.
How old do I look?
Twenty-five? Around there.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
The sky!!!
The sky?  Where?
Up there!!
I don't see anything!
Just look!!
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Say what?!
How do you do, ma'am.
I do alright.
Good!
Hi.
Well, we're here to help!
Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
Yes, ma'am.
Sorry, Mom!
I'll be all right.
You're my brave boy.
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Well, where are you --
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
Yes.
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
All back East.
Yeah.
Good god.
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
Well, put it down and come in!
You bet, hon!
I never know anymore.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
To you maybe.
The locks.
The locks?
Then after that it's safe.
It's safe.
To go up.
No.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
Really?
How could you?! This is just like home!
Would you like a tranquilizer?
You have tranquilizers?
I told you! I've got everything!
What?
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Honey?
I've noticed.
If I...you know...
Yes.  Well... yes.
What?
Hi.
Coming!
And I made these!
If he tells, it won't come true!
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Yeah. Let's dig in!
Yes...
Sure.
I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey?
Just open the door.
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
Yes.
I don't believe it!
We do?
Yes.
Excuse me.
I want him to at least see the sky!
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
--do as I say!
Yes, dear, I know.
What are you doing here?
I forgot some of my stuff.
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
I knew you'd like him.
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
Oh, my God...
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
That's what I'm sensing.
He's from Alaska.
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
Uh..he might of.
We did not leave together.
Who did he leave with?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
To bed.
To bed?
What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn minute!
Or have perfect table manners.
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
What?!!
Coward!
What?!
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Give it back to him.
And if we can't find him?
We'll find him.
Yeah! That's thinking.
Then what?
We came back to the house!
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
Where?!
Stop!
Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
Buy it from me?
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
I've seen a few.
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Yes.
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Yes?
Anything you can tell me?
The criminals are winning.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
It's blue. Blue velvet.
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
No, not at all.
Who knows you have these?
Only you and the photo lab.
You're all through with this now?
Yes sir. I sure am.
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Jeffrey nothing.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
THEN WHAT?
Then you got undressed.
I, I don't know.
What do you want?
Yes.
Lie down on the bed.
Sure I'm alright. 
I'll go then.
No.
It's okay. It's okay.
See my breasts? See?
See my nipples?
Yes.
No, please. I won't.
Yes, I like you.
You don't?
No. What is happening?
Yeah, hurry up though.
I, uh.
Frank? Can you stand up?
Who's it, you mean.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
No.
Falling.
Don? Are you in with them?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Please, please stay.
Hello.
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Frank is coming?
Sure I do.
I'm doing it.
Are you a bad boy?
Whatiya mean?
I want you to hurt me.
Frank would open you.
Shut up.
Beeeee careful.
Come on Dorothy.
Sometimes I think I do.
No, it's not Don.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
Yes.
I want you to stay with me.
I think I better go.
You look beautiful to me.
No.  Hi baby.
My secret lover.
Who, Dorothy?
Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
Don? Where is he?
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
Alright, suit yourself.
He's comin' back? What for?
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
Hello, daddy.
My bourbon.
Mommy's here.
Baby wants to fuck.
Then, shut up!
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Those are my breasts.
Can I feel 'em?
If you want to.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Speak to me Fucker.
No thanks. What does that mean?
Go where?
On a ride.
What?
Nothing.
What kinda beer do you like?
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
Good, let's drink up.
This is it.
Be right down.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Of course, Jeffrey.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Would you like a piece of cake?
No. No thank you.
Yeah.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
That sounds great!
Anyone else? Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
I'll get a coat for her.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Uh-uh.
It's good to see you, Dad.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
How is Central these days?
Terrible boring.
What else is new? Right?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
I don't know. He moved away.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
I don't know.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
I'm here, aren't I?
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
Let's go.
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Two.
I'll drink to that.
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Okay, yeah, call.
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
He got a little jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
Actually. I've been in twice.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Yes.
Did you see her undressed?
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
That's what I thought.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Okay, Sandy.
Okay, okay.
Goodnight.
See ya tomorrow.
I'm really sorry.
What am I going to do?
You want to go talk to him?
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Jeffrey? Why?
Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
What is it?
Just some fatherly advice.
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.
Where to?
You look beautiful.
I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
I can't dance fast.
Really?
Just a minute.
Okay.
Frank!!!
Yes.
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Go ahead.
Go ahead!
You can change it if you want to.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
The Duke?  What did you do?
Go find one.
Mother Mary, full of grace.
What did you do, Connor?
Aye.
Look under the body.
Got it.
Any word back from the E.R.s?
Chest pocket.  Shit!
This is a six-shooter.
Yes.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
You think they sold me out? No way.
I-I'll tip her.
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!
I know what the fuck he looks like!
What?  What, that guy?
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
We're here brother.
You gotta keep going.
Connor, is that you?
What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here.
BLAME...
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
All right, I suppose you have the right ta know.
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
I'll call you tonight, afterwards. 
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
y-y-yeah that's what he said.
me up the...
Ass!
Aye.
Shut it. It's Ma.
He got beat up by a girl.
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
No pictures, either.
...so that which is good may flourish
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
What?
I'm serious.
I don't know they just always need it.
What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
A bit.
Me, too.
Just like on TV.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
Then what the fuck?
Holy shit. Who? How many?
I'm strangely comfortable with it.
So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
He's a good man.
We do not want your tired and sick.
It is your corrupt we claim.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
Okay then... let's get ya started.
Yeah?
Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
Uh... two shooters!
Fan-fuckin-tastic!
That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
Can she I.D. them?
They were wearing masks.
Of course they were. How many?
No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.
That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
How do you figure?
Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends.
Where's my cat?
You... oh god, why?
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
It was... It was...
Male or female, bitch?!!
Really want to know?
The fat man.
New hitman wants to leave his mark
The Sicilians.
Twist of lemon!
Chief, what the fuck is this?
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Eight.
A couple of peons for the mob and...
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
I...
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
We promise.
We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
Hey Murph.
Roc. You okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
No. You sure you're okay?
Hey, Murph.
Roc. You okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
This is some crazy shit, man!
Those cocksuckers sold me out!
Y'know it is, a bit.
Well, I'm sold.
Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
What the fuck do you mean?
I mean he ain't here.
Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
Yes.
You feel?
Yes.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
I believe these young men are right.
You know them personally?
Yes.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
Open it!
Have you no fear of God?
God have mercy on my soul.
What do you want me to say?
Just be natural, goddamit.
How long since your last confession, my son?
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Making Hutch David Soul?
Right. The blond guy.
OK. That's wrong.
Dignan, it's --
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
He says. This is he.
This is he?
No. This is he.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
She's an attractive older woman.
What do you think the cops have?
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
How was I ridiculing you?
Yeah, I saw it.
I'm lookout.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
That sets it off.
Yeah, I heard that.
Five, seven, eight dollars.
Eight dollars.
That's not bad.
Hang on a second.
Yeah.
Just turn right here.
No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
Where's the other stocker?
There's another stocker, right?
We know there's another stocker.
Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
Yeah.
Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
What do you think?
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
I don't want to use it.
Well, then cut it in half.
I keep it for emergencies.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Yes, they are.
Look at the treads on those.
What about them?
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
You were spoiled rotten.
I'll say it.
OK. Go ahead.
On your marks...  Get set go.
Bob?
It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
Hi.
Inez, this is --
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
What. What's the matter?
On the left.
No kidding.
Obviously. That's a given.
Bob?
They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.
Where was it parked?
Right here.
Maybe he just went to the store.
We said 48 hours.
This morning.
Where was I?
You were asleep.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
Can you hand me those french fries.
Would of been nice.
She doesn't need to know.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram.
Don't panic, Anthony.
I'm not. But there's --
That's not correct.
I know.
Where's the rest?
$383.
That's what she is!
I know that. But --
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
Ah. Couple days ago.
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
You really hit a guy with a bottle?
What is it?
Let me feel that.
He seems pretty good.
Bob!
Get out of the way.
No, Dignan. This isn't --
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
I'm sorry, Bob.
OK. Mark that down.
I did.
It's like we've finally arrived.
I don't think you will.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
He was all right.
As a person?
Yeah. As a girl.
Yes. I do.
So do I.
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
You're all clear.
Roger.
Hang on a second.
OK. Roger.
Good. It's supposed to be.
Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
It's going back down.
Applejack! What's happening?
Get against the wall!
I don't know.
Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him?
Let's go. Come on.
Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
I'll see you there.
What?
I'll see you there.
What are you talking about?
I'll get him.
There's not enough time.
Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
I don't think so.
Can't remember shit. CRS.
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
Yeah.
I'm not kidding.
What'd he get?
Pretty much everything.
The grandfather clock?
We're not sure.
Nothing.
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
How big is it?
Oh, I'd say about --
Behind Bob's house.
He stole a tractor.
No. I'm not.
How?
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
Dignan, I --
Nice to meet you.
That's a sharp jacket.
Thanks.
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
What do you mean?
Take a deep breath.
It feels good.
Yes, he did.
How'd he do?
No, that door over there.
I don't want to die.
Are you afraid?
Death.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Who?
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
Hector woudn't do anything.
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
You could make your own cinnamon toast.
Let them fight.
See you, Bob.
There's a million places to hide around here.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
I hope not.
Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
He looked too shaken-up.
Is that OK?
I'm not playing any more golf.
Why not?
Yes. You just got to stick with it.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Why do you say that?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
No. I wasn't adopted.
Jesus Christ! No.
It was stupid.
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
I didn't do anything.
Who's got the car keys?
Temporarily.
Dies y nueve.
Cuba.
God, yes. Like silk.
Like silk?
You're Anthony?
Yeah.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
Uh-uh.
Abdul-Shabazz?
Feel this.
The front stairs.
Where were you?
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
Wait a second.
That's your friend Anthony?
Yeah.
What's he doing here?
You don't celebrate til it's over.
Bob! Get back in position!
You're the faggot.
I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
Not even for emergencies?
No.
So who's going to know?
My brother.
Let's cut the bullshit.
Can you use a coaster.
Yes. I did.
OK, Bob.
Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
What did I say?
I told you he's crazy.
I warned you, Dignan.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her.
Let's just go.
That's your domain.
OK.
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
God DAMMIT.
This is natural.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
Don't count it.
No. I was calm.
I don't want to talk about it.
Bob, I've got nightmares.
I told you they were there.
It's registered in my mother's name.
What the fuck possessed you?
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
See you in a little while.
My brother's in jail.
What are you talking about?
They said he's a drug dealer.
That could be anybody's.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
I don't know.
We'll have to see when we get back.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Bob, that makes no sense.
Come on, Dignan.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
I'm going back.
Not in that car you're not.
I can't do that, Bob.
I know it's not.
You don't even know his name.
Yes, I do.
What is it?
Just get in the car, Bob.
Let's go.
Anthony. Bad news.
Not bad.
Not a whole lot, Bob.
Man, I don't want to go into this.
I never agreed to that.
Bob, you're lying!
Bullshit.
I didn't have any choice.
That's OK.
I know it, man. Hang on.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah?
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
Stand by. Bird Dog?
He's having a heart attack or something.
I think so.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
He's stuck between two floors.
Run. Run. Let's go.
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
Do you have your own cell?
No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
Here we go.
Now!
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
He said you ran away from home.
No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
And what does that cover?
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Hand to hand combat?
Did you hear that?
I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
He's damn good.
We're just going over a few things.
Why?
Well, I think --
Who? Applejack?
Can't get it. It won't... 
What can we do?
Where's that guy going?
He left his sweater.
Well, I left some money in there.
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
No. I just have short hair.
Is that your chiquita?
No, my friend knows her.
She Chicano, yes?
Sure.
Got a little lucky.
Where's your friend? He go with the chiquita?
She is a good looking woman.
Fight. You know.
You Hoto?
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
Right.
Mr. Henry?
Come on in!
It's locked.
No, it's not.
Good to know you, John.
What?
Pleasure to meet you, John.
Nice to meet you.
There was a mistake.
What?
Never heard of it.
That's not gonna fly.
I want to know about Treadstone.
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
Did he say anything to you?
No... It must have been Bourne.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
'Why' would be enough for me.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
Why not? It was just money.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
Had to be done.
No good options left?
The sooner the better.
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
I killed them.
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
I don't want you to forgive me.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
Look at me.
Because you're afraid!
Is this really happening?
I'm sorry.
Felt a little light.
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
Conklin.
He's dead.
Who sent you to Greece?
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
I don't know who that is.
What's going on in Berlin?
I don't know! Why would I lie?
I'm sorry.
-- my coat -- but we should --
-- what? --
Conklin up front.
I'll get the book.
No. There's nothing new.
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
-- it hasn't been two years --
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
I worry when you get like this.
I should be better by now.
The Telegraph office.
But we were so careful.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
He was at the campground yesterday.
We can't wait to be sure.
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
What?
Switch! You drive!
-- where? -
-- not yet --
-- it's just him? --
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
There must be another way!
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
Tell me later.
But you found another choice.
I did.
You do?
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
Get on it.
You hear me? I believed you.
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
I want to hear it from you.
What do you mean?
My first job.
Your first assignment was Geneva.
That's a lie!
I was here!
I want to come in.
I want someone I know to take me in.
Careful...
Are you disappointed?
Sounds like a threat.
You didn't answer my question.
I'm working on it.
Who's going? Us?
Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
-- the hotel -- how far? --
What?
But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
What? The tapes?
Here?
Now. Show now.
Is there. Is all there.
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
-- shut up! -- just shut the --
It's a lot of money, Pam.
Before this? Before Bourne? No.
Are you an expert in amnesia?
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
Are we locked up?
Yes. In that order.
And what about you, anything?
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
Peace?!
We cannot defeat this --
You've all sworn to Longshanks.
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
He will. I know he will.
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
So I did! And what was so important about it?
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
You mock us with a smile?
Hamish, I... thank...
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
Aye.
We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
I rest.
Your rest is making me exhausted.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
How many?
Three, maybe more!
They're English soldiers, ain't they?
I wanna have supper waitin'.
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
Aye, we'll get 'em.
You win.
I should'a remembered the eggs.
A patriot!
We don't split up!
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
All men lose heart. All betray. It is exactly why we must make the choices we make.
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
Let her speak.
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
Thank you for inviting.
I... accept your proposal!
I'm not just saying it!
Nor I!
I will be with you, like this. Forever.
...Tonight!
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
And I with you. But you must wake.
I need you so much! I love you!
Wake up, William. Wake up!
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for.
Wife of Edward, the king's son?
It's battle I want, not talk.
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
Peace is made is such ways.
SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
And I will consult with mine.
They've tricked us.
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
No English lord would trust an Irishman!
Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
But you must have something to go on?
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
You'd be surprised how often they are.
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
So what did you find.
We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
Um... can dad come this time?
You know the answer to that.
Can't he come out for one day?
But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
Great. I'll see you soon.
I... I don't remember.
Something must've happened! What set him off?
I... I blacked out.
How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
Weirder than this?
Not in this wing, actually. No.
No, protecting her.
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
Are you sure? Not even with my father?
Books?
My journals! Where are they?
I thought you were a December baby.
This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
Shhh! I need quiet for this.
What?
Huh?
Fuck off, frat boy.
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
You really don't remember anything that happened?
I'm sorry.
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
I've stopped a hundred times.
So how's Tommy?
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Not if you remember my dad.
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
It was a long time ago.
I know, but...
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
Go on. Sit down.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
What do you mean?
He's a fucking maniac!
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
Because you're... different.
Know what?
Been there, done that.
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
We'll find out soon enough.
Me neither.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
Evan Treborn.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
You're kidding. He's so... big.
Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
What happened?? Where are we?!
What's wrong with you?!
Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
I think I'll go check out the chapel.
Huh?
You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
Oh my God oh my God...
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
Yes?
I came with Captain Renault.
I should have known.
My husband is with me, too.
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
Oh, yes.
And you want to know --
-- Will he keep his word?
He always has.
Oh, yes, please.
Go back to Bulgaria.
-- He's just a lucky guy.
-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
What is your name?
Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir.
I'm sorry. It is.
A champagne cocktail, please.
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
Monsieur Rick!
How long can I afford to stay closed?
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
I won't.
Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
-- Tonight he forgot.
Yes, I come, I will do it.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
That's all right.
Er, good luck, yes.
I'd better be going.
Er, my check, please.
You haven't heard my offer.
What do you want for Sam?
I don't buy or sell human beings.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
You needn't be concerned about me.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
I will.
Here's looking at you, kid.
And I was wondering.
Yes?
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
Yes, of course, we --
Especially tonight.
Has it got a wow finish?
I don't know the finish yet.
I don't think I will, Rick.
The stairs from the street.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
Put them on the table.
No.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
Oh, Rick!
Because you're getting on that plane.
I don't understand. What about you?
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Yes, ma'am.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
Won't you join us?
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
I will, don't worry.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
No, Victor, no.
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
We'll discuss it later.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
He suggested I ask you.
Ask me?
-- Yes?
I love you very much, my dear.
-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
Of course, I'll be careful.
Yes.
Rick? Who's he?
Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
You're saying this only to make me go.
How do you do?
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
Won't you join us for a drink?
What for?
Your work.
Thank you. I try.
We all try. You succeed.
Not at all.
Any time.
Right.
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
I said, ask your wife.
My wife?
Thank you.
Had a close one, eh?
Yes, rather.
Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
Yes.
Yes. What is it you want?
No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
Goodnight.
May we proceed with the business?
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
Good day.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.
I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
Good evening, Captain.
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
How about New York?
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
Mademoiselle.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
But I have no excuse to close it.
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
The clipper to America.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
I was misinformed.
A wise foreign policy.
Victor Laszlo.
Victor Laszlo?
His escape.
Oh, but I just told you. --
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
He is traveling with a lady.
He'll take one.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
-- Thanks. I will.
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
Go ahead, Ricky.
Oh, he won't be followed here.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
I have. Sit down over there.
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
Uh huh.
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Will I see you tonight?
I never make plans that far ahead.
Sacha, she's had enough.
Don't listen to him, Sacha. Fill it up.
-- Sacha, call a cab.
Take your hands off me!
What is your nationality?
I'm a drunkard.
I haven't the slightest idea.
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
Put that phone down!
Put it down!
Hello Ugarte.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
He'll double what I pay you.
Yeah?
You ever going to bed?
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Good. Then have a drink.
No. Not me, boss.
Then don't have a drink.
Boss, let's get out of here.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
No, sir. I'm staying right here.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
Worse than Warsaw.
Nobody remembers that.
Catch another fish tomorrow.
Feels so good to lie here.
Get up, damn you.
You've had today's water.
Thirsty.
Going to die anyway.
Take it.
No.
Take it, damn it.
No.
Survive today, that's the point.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
Fix raft first.
Water water water --
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
Why do they have to die for me?
They'd eat you if they could.  They're laughing at you.  Listen.
No!
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
Die tomorrow or die today.
I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.
You are.
Nothing out there but ocean.
Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
As much as anybody.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
Yeah.  A long time ago.
They're harder to do than they look.
Oh?  You've tried?
Well, I do a little drawing --
He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
No.  that was the last one.
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
Sure.
Had a package to deliver.
You?  Personally?
Must be a story there.
I've got lots of time.
So do I.
Cold.
Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
Not if you work for FedEx.
You don't seem too happy about it.
Let me guess, Russia came up?
He's your cute thing.
I can't even keep fish alive.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
For when I travel?
I have to.
You want to.
Could you watch Jango?
No.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
Hey...hey...it's okay!
A few things came up.  Or went down.
I thought you might have.
I would never --
I know.
If I'd known you were alive --
Is that Jango?
My epitaph.
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
What was inside?
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
Not when you have no choice.
I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does.
Great.  Really.
I don't know.  I really don't know.
It means a lot...that you came.
You too.
And how was your Christmas?
Terrific.  Yours?
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
Which I didn't have.
I most definitely say I am.
So did I.
Mom, meet Jango.
It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
Oh no, the prodigal son's home.  We bring out the store bought.
The place is falling apart.
I'm doing fine.
The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
It was fifteen minutes late.
You fucked us over.
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
For all those vacation days you got coming.
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...
You're fucking dead!
You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!
Want to see my raft?
Forty-three days.
To Wilson.
That's all there is.
Believe me I know.
Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
What?
Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
No sweat.
Permission granted.
San Francisco.  And you?
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
You weren't dreaming about me.
I was!
It was just the ether, Wilbur...
They just want you to hire some new help.
Some new *things* would be useful. I don't need any "new help."
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples?
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
I'm sorry, Homer.
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
And that I can drive a truck!
Better than I can!
I doubt it. She's just an...
She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Wally said to say, "Hello."
Candy. Candy Kendall.
Two.
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
Really?
Burma!
Oh...
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
Yes! I've only seen one, though.
"King Kong". It's really good.
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Just a little privacy.
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
The *speaker*. For the movie sound.
Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
Right.
*What* will be okay?
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
You don't understand! It's her father...
Mr. Rose *knows*?
He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!
He's *paralyzed*!
What do you want me to *do*?
Please don't...
She knows how to take care of herself.
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
Hi...
Why?
I never said they were boring.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
Well, they aren't.
Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
Nobody ever wants me!
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
Nobody special enough, Curly.
You mean somebody asked?
Only the right people can have you, Curly.
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
"...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939."
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
*Liver* killed him?
But did you know him?
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
Did you know your mother better?
What's a nanny do?
She looks after other people's children.
Did you grow up around here?
No. She was an immigrant.
What's an immigrant?
Someone not from Maine.
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
That's why Kong loves her!
Is that soon?
I don't remember.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered...
A B-24 Liberator.
Liberator...
Have you enlisted?
Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
It's all very normal.
*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
Migrants?
What about the trees?
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
You still doin' it too fast!
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
Yes, for both.
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
Obviously.
I don't know it.
Nobody's named this one yet.
It's my turn!
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
I don't think so.
You do it then.
It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
Long enough. You ain't gonna stop it.
We heard that one already, Homer.
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
It's just my heart.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Not yet. What do you know about it?
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
But you don't look very happy.
That's it.
Now, now. He's a good boy.
Shit. We don't know what he is.
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
When will he be home, Major?
Four weeks or so, right around Halloween.
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
Mind your own business, Peaches.
Sorry, Homer...
We see you next harvest.
It look nicer then home!
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
I told him that you all is sick.
Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.
She took off in the night!
She took off on the bicycle, man.
He ain't never been outta Maine!
Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
Really? Wish we had met eight hours ago.
What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
Everything looks in order.
This has to happen fast.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
There'll be red flags.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
Ten percent. Of how much?
Two million.
The Anti-Christ?
Gee... What makes you say that?
Your life flashing before your eyes?
Just the last three weeks.
That's not a bad place to start.
It's all about the money, isn't it?
Isn't it always?
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
After you cut her loose.
She walked.
Today? Started off great...
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
Let's go, Jake?
But you won't get that splatter effect.
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
And what about Big Al?
Tonight. Just me.
Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
Two million.
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
We pay better.
She's up for it.
We'll use the Euc.
That's it.
What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
Minus one.
Why not?
Let me repeat -- Why not?
Because you killed one of my crew.
I think two million.
Stake you?
No thanks. I'm good.
Come here!
I think I just broke my hand.
Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy.
Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Ring it for him, Sobo.
Good boy.
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
Help me.
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
You get an equal cut.
What do I have to do?
Just play a part. A little acting.
I'll worry about Customs.
Don't worry about it.
And some new clothes.
Why?
I don't trust anyone.
Then show me how.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Do you have something to prove?
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
How do you know I will?
Don't ruin this for me.
WHAT?
You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
What about what?
What about the money?
What do you want? An apology?
No, I want my cut!
Then shut up.
My place.
You sure we're clear?
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
What?
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
We never had a problem with that before.
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
You sure?
Where the hell is she?
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
This is embarrassing.
I'll find the time.
Keep it up.
What?
Stand up.
Eee Oott Auught!
Sorry. What?
You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the airport...
In over your head?
Pretty much.
Huh? Oh. She's alright.
The King.
So what do you want?
We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
I try.
Let's just say he burned me once.
We're here.
Peace of mind.
That's it?
Not everyone's on the take, Walter.
To who?
That's what I'm talking about.
I'm down!
Jack Manfred.
Is it that bad?
How do I look?
No. Thanks.
My car's in the garage.
Maybe another time.
I'll take you up on that.
It's the tension.
All men are cheats.
I got scared.
I can imagine.
Well it is. But I know where I am.
Sorry.
What are you talking about?
A couple I know are getting married.
What's the Blue Book price?
What?!
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
Seven-fifty.
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
We all played the field.
I want a job, Giles.
All right. As what?
I'm working on that soccer story.
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
Looking forward!
Who was he?
She.
It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble.
Not particularly.
And your lady?
Not entirely.
How's that football story corning along?
You mean I won't resist them.
I won't be that long.
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
I. sold the car.
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you.
I've got something to tell you.
I want to hear it.
I've got a job.
How did you land that?
I love you Jack, you know that.
You've got such beautiful hands.
I don't know.
Fine.
Tension. It'll go.
Poor baby.  This'll relax you.
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
Probably.
What about a drink on the way home?
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
Well, that's our life now, isn't it?
Why not?
Without hope there's no point to anything.
Leave it.
No. Answer it!
I hope it brings you luck.
It will.
Not talking. Writing.
Never. Why do you ask?
Really?
There was a message, wasn't there?
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
Then what?
Leave me alone, Marion.
I hate public transport.
What?
How can anyone be that naive?
Found a job?
No.
Don't let yourself down.
I won't.  Goodbye, dad.
Well, thank you anyway.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
There's a casino in this hotel.
So why did you come to my casino?
In the casino.
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
Do you believe in astrology?
Toss you for it.
I don't gamble.
Just an accident. Nothing.
Turn left ahead.
I'll watch.
You don't like cheats, do you.
You choose.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
What kind of trouble?
I owe a lot of money.
Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion.
Who's they?
The point is, they want a man inside.
And I thought you were a bright woman.
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
But if it does.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
What ten thousand pounds?
What about my neck?
No, forget it. The bet's off.
Let it go.
I told you, all bets are off.
What for?
I have to take the car.
Yes.
Thank you.
It's all relative.  I need the money too.
Yes.
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
I've still got mine.
I took the bandage off yesterday.
No thank you.
Jack! It's Jani.
Who...
Ross.
Who did it? Tell me!
You did?
Have I?
I'm Lucy.
And what do you do, Lucy?
Are you going to put a spell on me?
Turn left at the lights.
Over the river.
Have you got transport?
She's my baby.
Not bad. I have other interests, of course.
I'm not going to report it.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
Good call. Help yourself.
That bitch? No.
No thanks.
Don't worry, I won't report you!
I don't gamble.
Rough life, Jack.
I'll tell you later.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
I'm afraid that's not so, sir.
It was you, you shit.
I was at Beadles.
Why four? And not three or five?
Any exceptions?
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
Give me 365.
We do. 
Where's the magnet?
They've been tested.
I don't think so.
Wipe your hands.
What happens if I want to sneeze?
You won't. Not without permission.
Five.
I make it six.
Five.
I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
Fine.
Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
All right, Mr Reynolds.
He's a good customer.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
Bruised.
Right, that checks out here.
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
I think he's talking to it.
Key? Key? What is the key?
Where's the fail-safe key?
The key!
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
You must have it, you idiot, we can stop the bomb!
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Where is the key?
We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
Oh, God...
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
Doolittle, are you there?
Yoo hoo, bomb...
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
Pinback, throw me the chart log.
I read the same here.
-- open quantum latches --
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Arm yourself, bomb.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
Huh?
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Hello, bomb.
Of course.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
But how do you know you exist?
It is intuitively obvious.
This is fun.
Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
And you can only do it once, right?
So if you detonate in...
...nine seconds...
I have no proof that it was false data.
You have no proof that it was correct data.
Mafhkin oble groop...
Yes, Doolittle.
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
Yes.
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Any of 'em any good?
Naah. All stable.
Who cares. Don't bother me.
Commander Powell is dead.
Wha?
Veil nebula.
Ah, negative drop.
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
-- automatic channels open --
-- Remark.
5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
Must get lonely being up here so much.
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
What was that, Doolittle?
Negative effect.
It didn't work?
That's correct, sir.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Well, what you might try is --
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
We're running out of time, sir.
Talk to the bomb.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Phenomenology...
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
Bruno's girlfriend.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
That's not why we're here.
I'm outta Portland.  Sonrisa didn't want local talent.
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
Who's Camille?
None of your business.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
You know each other?
Leave.  Now.
Where?
You mean until you showed up?
You're not still pissed?
Police drone.
What?  Where're we going?
No time.
No way.
Don't look down.
Yeah, well around here, I'm the Most High... From now on, before you do anything, call in for instructions.
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
A grand.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
I'll make it worth your while.
It's a rule.
Am I?
Every week.
They took my daughter.
I know.
Can you help me get her back?
Look, I'd really like to...
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
Are we in some kind of trouble?
Mommy, where are you?
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
Soon, baby.
Mommy, I'm scared.
Girl's gotta make a living.
Thank God.
You're lucky.  I almost pulled the trigger.
We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
The one you're wearing?
Wasn't that hard.
Girlfriend?
I'm not a half bad cook.
You got a lotta nerve.
Bent.
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
That would be appropriate, yes.
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
We are not fine.
You need to get out more.
C'mere, I want to show you something.
The other one like you...
You lost me.
Your basic hodge-podge.
Hardly...
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
Open it.
Deeds, not words.  I need your help.
We're quoting Mom again.
You don't want to.
But she does work here?
Can't help you.
A friend of your fiance's.
What do you want?
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
I think you should go now.
Let go of my hand.
I understand.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
I'm on my way.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
I just don't go in with any expectations.
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
You know what I'm saying.
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
Where?
It's a secret.
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
And because he's my friend.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
They're prisoners to their genes.
So are dogs.
Only one I can think of.
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars...
I have sincere eyes.
You get it when I get her.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
Probably a touch of what's going around.
What if he's on the level?
You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
Right, the big one-oh.
We gotta talk.
What's up?
But there's another side--
Really?
A toy?
--a philandering pig.
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
Easy Sketchy.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
Say the words, "I understand."
I want you on call here.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
For a change.
I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
Gin.
My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
No, I mean... you love your son?
More than anything in the world.
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
Pick a song, Hawk.
Got any KISS?
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
Yeah, a man's drink...
Thanks.
It's okay.
Yeah?
Believe it.
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
Right, slow...
Oh, screw it!
That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
You got in the car, didn't you?
Yeah.
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
What's in Sandusky?
Plenty, but it was all bad.
Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
YO, DOOFUS!
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
Damn straight we are.
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
The paint!
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Tickets?
Nah. Couldn't be.
And if it ain't cleaned off?
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
Hawk?
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
What's gone?
Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!
Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
NOW!
Uhh... nothing.
You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
I said, I'm sorry!
Yeah.
Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
What?
You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
Look, you can have my wallet...
The KISS Army!
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Not if I shoot first!
I don't even think you have a gun!
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
Yeah.
Yeah, you did!
Good morning...
Are you AFRAID?
GOOD MORNING!
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
Did you know him?
A metal craft of any kind.
Beg pardon?
Not until like... eighth grade.
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
Donnie! Give it back!
You know what? I think that you did it.
What did you say?
Our saviour...
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
You'll know soon enough.
Where did you come from?
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
You have to do something for me first.
You have a request?
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
Take it off. I want to see you.
I am so sorry.
Why do they call you Frank?
Hey...
School's cancelled.
Sure.
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
What makes you think I'm not?
We never would have had this conversation.
I'm sorry.
That was a compliment.
Where are we going?
I'm going home.
Yeah?
Well...
You want to kiss me...
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
What?
Are you okay?
Infant Memory Generators.
The whole movie. Let's go.
What do you mean?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Hey. You OK?
My mom is gone.
Where is she?
Where are we going?
Who's Frank?
Yeah...
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
When did you stop taking your medication?
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
That is a terrible nickname.
Know what?
You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
Grandma Death.
I know, Dad.
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away.  She was right about the rabbits. Go.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
His name is Frank.
Frank.
Don't you watch the news?
I don't own a television.
Follow him where?
I met a girl.
What is her name?
Do you think a lot about girls?
I think about girls a lot.
I asked you about school.
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
What else do you think about during school?
Who is the boss?
Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
Four times... so far.
Can anyone else see him?
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
Is Callie still around?
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
I... I was playing with fire.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
Yes. I went to jail.
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
That I did it again.
I think now that he might...
Because I'm so horny.
God exists because you're horny.
I have the power to build a time machine.
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
Then how is time travel possible?
Frank is going to kill.
Who is he going to kill?
Goodbye, Donald.
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
What's her name?
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Why would I tell Mom?
Because you tell Mom everything.
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
Everything is going to be just fine.
Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Frank?
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
You're not a bitch.
He was a year ahead of us?
Donnie? You're a dick.
You can suck a fuck.
It is a big deal.
How did this happen?
I guess they made him do it.
The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
I think we've all seen "Bonanza".
Kitty...
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism.
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
Raspberry.
No more fuckin' for her.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
She's alive, sweetie.
Where is she?!
She's right over there.
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
Yeah, you betcha...
Oh-yah.
You-betcha.
Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
I gotta work with these women.
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.
"Here," wh-wh-what?
Oh-you-beccha.
Huh?
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
That's my mom.  I'll get 'em in a sec.
Oh... How quickly they grow up.  Hey, if they ask you to take off your shirt, get the money first.
I love you much.
We was robbed.
It's okay.
We all do. Now let's go.
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
Good, 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's, it's Nazi Germany!
Oh, I'll "get it." I'll "get it" all right. I might even take seconds.
Here, have some.
Hi.
NO...  It's all right. I got it. Don't worry about it.
Then it must be Wednesday.
Okay... well, bye.
Bye.
Are we on "Cops" again?
You could be quiet.
Hi.
Hi.
This here's Loretta.
Loretta, shut it.
Oh, Christ, it's true.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
All right, they're makin' a movie.
You don't know where this is gonna...
I got a hairdo.
Okay. Take her purse.
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
Okay?
Mm-hm.
Dakota.
Ohio...
That bitch from...
What?
Wisconsin.
All right, then.
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
And the year before that?
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
Yeah, yeah, the Jew.
Becky was my only shot at state!
A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
Oh, my!  Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?
You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
"Proud... to be... an... American."
What!
We need more bars!
This is -- what?
Enid ate a whole pan!
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
I will if you shut your piehole.
Close up shop!
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
And wear a crown and everything.
And everything.  He should be king!
Take a letter.
Who to?
The President of the United States.
Take another letter...  to my tailor.
You do and I'll fire you.
Send for my car...
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
Take a letter...
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
I wanna powder my nose...
What's the matter with you?
All right -
What kind of a dog is he?
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
Well - what is he now?
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Half watch dog?
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
What do you whistle?
Yankee Poodle.
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
No, but I shot some ducks.
I don't wanna work at all.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
What did you say to her?
I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
So! -- He's on your side, too.
Firefly must be captured at any cost.
It must be done right away.
I can't do it right away.
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -
Go ahead.
And Vera niece, too.
Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
You swine!
Once more! 
You upstart!
Yes.
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
Bah!! 
THEN IT'S WAR!
Oh -- you mean... worm?
No, that wasn't it...
Was it -- swine?
No... it was a seven letter word.
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
That's it...
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
Why -- why -- of course.
Take a seat -- you're next. 
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
For you, I would do anything... 
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- 
It is every woman's problem.  Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands?  Who...
I thought everything was working out fine.
Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
Yes please, two.
One or two?
Two, please.
I've always thought that myself.
Oh, yes.
I'll join you shortly.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.
Do you?
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
Hmmm?
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
That I am very little different from him.
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
Yes?
I found it.
Did you see it?
What is it?
Like this. 
I'll show you! I'll show you!
Shut up!
He fell.  He falls.
He must have taken quite a fall.
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
That's the way he sleeps. If he lays down, he'll die.  Head's too heavy.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
Never mind that, I want my man!
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
I want him back!
Good morning, sir.
You've acquired a taste for this?
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Don't be mad. This muck can kill you.
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
No, more of an acquaintance.
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
And what was that, John?
Of course they will. They're reasonable men.
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
I feel much better. Thank you.
I am very pleased to meet you.
I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day.
Three quarters of an hour.
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
Nothing of any importance, eh?
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
I knew you'd understand. Here.
Yes.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
Alas, no.
No, but I certainly shall.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
y-y-yes--
Want to come out?
You're English.
Yes.
Won't be a moment.
Yes.
Good morning.
Where did you get this box?
The main spire.
Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
Yes John!
Yyyess.
Yyess.
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
Hello...
My name is...
My... name is...
John Merrick.
John... Merrick
Say "Merrick".
Merrick...
Say "Mmmerrick."
Mmmerrick.
Mmmerrick.
Righteousness for his namesake.
Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.
Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
Yes.
The hospital?
Of course! What did you think?
Thank you very much.
I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
Ohhh...
How is your tea, John?
Who are they of?
Oh, our relatives... the children.
The children! May I see?
Of course.
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
Here.
...Can you cure me?
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
Yes, John.
You did this for me?
Yes.
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
Oh no, I couldn't.
Yes, very soon.
I'm glad, John. Goodnight.
No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.
Yes! The workhouse!
Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
A dressing bag.
Very smart indeed.
Yes. John wants it.
I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
And who might you be, sir?
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
Pardon me?
Never mind. I'm the owner.
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
Ah! It's my father!
Open up! I know you're in there!
Who, Father?
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
You're losing your temper!
But, Father, it IS!
I said welcome.
WELCOME?
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
What are what?
Those things in your hands.
Yes.
But surely you know...?
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
What was she like?
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
But you LOVED her all the same...
We never went to bed together.
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
I've never been to bed with anybody!
"The fifth one this week"!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Five this week; how many the week before?
You're as bad as my father.
And the week before that?
Halfdan the Black.
But, Erik...
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
Why?
I'll bring it back.
Erik. You don't understand.
Goodbye, Aud...
I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
Do you believe I love you?
The second note to wake the Gods...
There is something I must ask the Gods...
But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
We blew the Horn Resounding.
SHE blew the Horn Resounding.
I see the world.
Is it night or day, Erik?
It is day, of course, Freya.
Is it summer or winter, Erik?
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
That I cannot tell you.
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
Well... isn't it great?
That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
A lot of people like our singing.
I'm sure it's lovely.
But you don't want to hear it.
No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
You've got to let me go!
He wants to kill US!
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
The important thing is not to panic.
Yes.
What about the raping?
Shut up.
You don't love ME.
Oh, get it over with.
I don't suppose... no...
What?
About NOT raping you...
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
Well you started it.
Ah.
Louder.
Aaagh! Rape!
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
Why should you care?
Why... should YOU care?
Why?
I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!
I don't know! I just did!
Find it... AND cross it!
But...
What?
I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
It saved my father!
No.
I know!
He wants to KILL us.
I know. I know.
What's it all about?
What?
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
I met this girl...
It's always the women that start the trouble.
She got me thinking...
So? What'd you do to her?
That's my boy!
Row! Row! Row!
Make your mind up.
You may need a real Berserk.
Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
The sun! That's it!
What "magic"?
You'll see!
Look out!
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
So?
Look... Erik...
Now stop it!
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
Well, come on!
To the oars!
Oh... I feel a little... oh...
I've got you!
You'll be sucked down too!
No! Arrgh!
Who gets killed?
Nobody gets killed.
Just say something cheerful.
Oh... right!  Well... CHEERS everybody!
Keitel Blacksmith?
What's the matter with Bjorn?
But how could he know... unless...
But...
How about making friends?
What are you talking about?
What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
We'd be the first!
I was sitting there.
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
We haven't got a spare place.
She MUST have a knife or something...
Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
I have to go...
Bye... sorry...
Yeah... well...
You will wait?
What d'you expect me to do?
The Dragon...
What do we have to do?
Do what?
Vanish into thin air?
He hasn't.
Well, where is he then?
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
No, it is NOT.
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
No, I'm not.
I mean many of the greatest sailors were.
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
Mum! Dad!
Got you!
What are you talking about?
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
For your own sake... For the others... I...
I... I...
Get away, Snorri.
What have you got there?
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
Yes yes... of course.... the "Blacksmith's Code"...
Can't make enough axe-heads!
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
That's right.
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Together we stand!
You can't let Erik do THAT.
Well... I... I thought...
How can we stops him now?
YOU do it!
I'm drowning! Help!
You'll drown us bo...
Help!
She knows it was our fault!
Like you got rid of Snorri!
I know, Dad.
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
I must KILL! Kill!
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
Stop it!
DEATH TO DRAGONS!
Sh!
I'm just building up to it, Dad.
GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
Easy, Dad!
Neither am I.
Me too.
I'm not frightened... of anything...
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
No... he's not... not... there...
Tell him I'm coming!
Yes, Mother.
And something to sharpen them with?
Yes, Mum.
And keep your sword greased.
Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
Say hi to Naomi.
I told you that later.
You did? You liked me?
Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?
Yes, please have a seat. He'll be right with you.
Hi.
Okay, I guess.
Here we are.
I was not.
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
In the world.
Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
Why?
Why what?
No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so...
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
I can't remember.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
Yeah, I got it.
I'm Joel.
I don't know what that means.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
Yes?
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
Probably see you at the book store.
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
You're sure? It's cold.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Wilmont. Near the high school.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Very much.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
I don't know.
Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.
You pick it.
You just say. I'm not really --
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
Yeah?
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
Yeah? Oh, great!
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
You'll call me, right?
Yeah.
Tomorrow?
It's three.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Where are you going?
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
I want to have a baby.
You're not ready.
Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
Would you get me another, Joely?
I want to know you.
No. Thanks.
Yeah, Tangerine?
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
What do you mean?
What?
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
I love it!
This is our first "date" date.
Do you remember what we talked about?
Naomi, I guess.
Yeah.
What was I wearing?
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
We did talk about Naomi.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I'm sure, I said.
But you weren't. I could tell.
And I didn't have an argument.
It's very late.
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
I did it. I guess that means something.
Not yet. Not married.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole human race pegged.
Hi.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
You said --
I'm Joel.
What do we do?
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
I love her.
Me too. There's this poem --
Seems too coincidental that way.
Yeah, maybe.
Um, no.
Let's move into this neighborhood.
Female.
What are you doing?
I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
Naomi.
I love you.
Yeah.
When?
Joel, come here. Please.
Have sex. Y'know --
Oh, um...
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
Well, you obviously don't know me.
A bully? Moi?
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
Doesn't sound like me.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
I just walked in.
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
You must have been crazy.
I don't know. Panties and --
Your dried cum.
Jesus.
Hi.
How's it going?
I know. I had to take the day to think.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
Long day thinking.
I'm like a joke to them.
It's too late.
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
That's your look for me.
What? What do you mean?
Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head, too.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
Hi.
Go back to sleep.
In a minute.
I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
I hope you get your work done.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
I'm glad you called.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
'Night.
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Nah, I don't know.
Hi.
Sorry. I just --
It's just... y'know... I mean...
'kay.
I better do this, Stan.
You found us okay?
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
What?
Listen, it's not erasing.
I don't know! I just said that!
You better go.
Hell no.
I swear.
Happy. Happy with a secret.
Hi.
What do you want, Stan?
Can I... I brought some --
I know what it is.
Then why did you ask me?
Mary... please. This is hurting people.
Yes?
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Thanks.
Welcome, Howard.
How do you mean?
You are such a sweetheart.
I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
You made me have an abortion.
It was a mutual decision.
I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
She came to help, Howard.
Yeah. Of course.
Oh dear.
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
Then check the connections.
This one's history. Moving on...
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Okay, There's more, Stan --
It's a quote book.
She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
I know who you are.
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
Clockworks.
Clockworks?
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
I'm staying with the Countess.
You don't?
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
Well.... er...
Why? Why do you have to go?
I was a successful model once.
For magazines?
Yep.
Hitchhiking?
I'm the best.
You're the best?
What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
I heard it.
So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
Justin?
Don't start with me, Cooper.
This is Cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway?
Coop, where are you...
The containment, Second Containment...
Hold on, Coop...
I'll get him.
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
No, thank you.
You weren't there. I saw it.
I'm telling you, I saw it...
I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
It is not.
Can you shut it down?
I don't want to go where the last crew went. I'd rather be dead.
Run!
Hear what?
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
Oh God...
Nothing. It's nothing.
A power drain --
90 over 50 and falling... .
He's crashing...
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
What's on your mind?
Some things you don't get over.
The dark inside me.
From the Other Place...
I built it.
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
Start the countdown.
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
Justin.
Skipper, you gotta help me...
Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
Starck, you still showing those readings?
There's no one here, Skipper.
What you got, Peters?
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
Alive?
Frozen.
Crystallized.
Peters...
...you okay?
Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.
Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan...
Justin.
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
That's what we're here to find out.
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
Be careful. It's not a load bearing structure...
Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
If it worked, yes.
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
The date.
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
I don't know.
Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
You said this ship creates a gateway...
The "Other Place," what is that...?
You can't, your orders are specific...
It's done.
Watch me.
Son of a bitch!
Then who the fuck are you?
Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller?
You know.
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
Better if I just show you.
What is that?
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
One-four degrees...
Dr. Weir...!
I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
Where is it?
Starck, give me a read.
We have a situation here...
We don't have time to fart.
Now what?
What is it, Smith?
Come again, Skipper?
Get out of there now!
Smith? Smith! Fuck!
I just finished drying...
Come around to three-three-four...
Radiation interference?
Keep your eyes open.
We're all here.
But you can breathe it.
Oxygen is not the problem.
Carbon dioxide?
No. It was someone else.
Who?
What is it, Starck?
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
What's going on in there, Starck?
Justin's in the airlock.
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
Blow it up?
No. I'll be right back.
...repeat, we're armed...
He's dead...
He served on the Goliath.
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
Can you see a body?
I did.
Not according to the computer.
Can you shut it down?
Do you know what it was?
Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
It's cold.
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
We're losing atmosphere...
Hey! You don't need to be a scientist figure it out...
All boards are green, everything's five by five.
Range 3000 meters and closing.
Picking up magnetic interference.
Explosive decompression.
Decompression wouldn't do that.
Get them back --
I'm trying, goddammit --
I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
Ship's log.
Yes.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
It wants me. I have to go.
The forward airlock.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
Relax, it's casual.
No, I mean... I'm a little... dusty...
I like the sound of that.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.
I mean...
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
Oh, he did.
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
Victor must've taken him.
I'm worried about you.
About me? How sweet.
What is this? Where's Reed?
Where do you think? With Sue.
Ben. This is business. Just work.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
This makes five.
He's made a few changes.
Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
I should have done more, run more tests --
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Well maybe you should date him.
Ben. Are you okay?
Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
Yeah, nine years straight.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
O-kay. We'll skip that question.
Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
Keep talking, there won't be a next time.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Don't you wander off, boy.
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
Go back to the drawing board.
Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
That's terrible news...
So are you!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Stay right. Left is trouble.
Last one down springs for room service.
Not this again --
No: You're ON FIRE!
Ben! Ben!
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
You've been working out.
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
I can go hotter!
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
But all these people...
Now.
Please tell me you go silent too.
Okay, "mom."
I think that thing is Ben.
Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
Dude. That's my sister.
Blockhead started it!
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
But Johnny... you can't fly.
Showtime.
Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
It's been changed.
Yes, thanks.
That's good. That's uh... good.
Passion.
What? What do you mean you --
Sue... look at your hands.
What...?  Oh.
If it happened to him, then it could...
I'm sure I can come up with something.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
Of course. Of course.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
Reed, we're running out of time.
Ben did this?
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
I understand the business reasons.
Raising the shields.
You can't leave them out there.
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Just find him.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
Oh, I think you already have.
Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
How much did they cost?
Don't worry about it.
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.
On the ledge?
First door on your left!
There it is!
Later.
This is how I dress all the time.
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton.
Sis.
Why can't you do it?
Your friends use the pool too.
I take out the garbage.
Don't strain yourself.
They're not home yet.
I'll explain everything later.
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
Where did you hear that?
I'm just guessing.
Well... it's true.
Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
You are a virgin!
But your face did!
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
They were left over from the last shift.
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
But they weren't mine.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
You're fired.
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Leave me alone.
Dad says!
Nice to meet you.
Mark is a really nice boy...
Sure. Come on in.
I don't know. It's getting pretty late...
Come on...
So are you.  Are you shaking?
No. Are you crazy?
What? Are you all right?
I think we're making a lot of noise.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I guess I did.
I didn't see you this morning.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
All right, I take it back.
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
Seventy-five dollars, and a ride. Okay.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
She's in my biology class.
Did you get her name?
Really?
Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.
Yeah?
Ace the jacket.
All right. Pay attention.
Mark. What happened to your date?
I'm really pretty busy...
Okay. See ya.
Really.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
You're crazy. Those girls love me.
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
Yes.
Not if you're over sixteen.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
I don't go at all.
That's me, Merv.
I thought he was out of town.
Then don't hassle it.
Naw. Any good?
Suzanne Somers' tits.
All right.
I like sex.
This ain't no cop.
They're fuckin' with us.
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
My brother is gonna shit.
Do you think that guy's cute?
Should we buy a frame for that?
No way! He just called him a dick.
God. People exaggerate so much at this school.
Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
What's the big deal?
Well I never did it.
There's nothing to it.
It was okay.
You'll always remember your first time.
It was nice.
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Hey! That's my line!
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Not since November.
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
Does that ever happen?
No. But it's a nice idea.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
What's Doug do in Chicago?
I think they're both virgins.
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
I don't know... I just don't feel right.
What do you think it is?
It couldn't be.
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
I paid for it and everything.
I want romance.
He's not coming.
Not coming? What happened?
Yeah, like maybe never.
But what are you going to do?
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
What class?
Hey, bud. What's your problem?
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
I couldn't make it in time.
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?
I don't know. I guess so.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
You're gonna flunk me?!
All right! Oh, yeah!
Aloha, Spicoli.
How about your phone number?
No problem.
Where do you feel like going?
I don't know. Wherever you want.
How about the point?
The point sounds fine.
All right, the point it is.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Yes... I am really nineteen.
What about those other guys you live with?
No. I mean back to your home.
You keep them.
Sure thing.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Oh yeah.
Two more Cokes.
Do you want to come inside?
Aren't your parents asleep?
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
Do you really have to go?
Well... it's getting kind of late.
It's John Bonham's birthday.
John Bonham?
I'll get you the notes.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
Two Cokes.
Okay. Thanks.
Awake? What do you mean?
Not for me.
Righto!
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Tell me. What do you want?
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
Naked.
He wanted the pineal gland.
Las Vegas.
That's a fine combination. You can't lose.
This is my granddaughter...
No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
Damn right!
The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
Why what?
Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
I have to go.
GO?
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
That's right, laugh about it! You goddamn honkies are all the same!
Whatever's right.
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
Plans?
Lucy.
I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
...and every one of them stacked naked...
They were all veterans.
No, she's looking for you.
Me?
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
Extract of pineal!
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
Never missed a plane yet.
Of course, officer.
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
You and a lot of other people.
Don't worry, it's all over now. Thank God for the decent people.
They can't get in here!  You said it yourself, they'll get in!
They'll get in! We'll all die!
Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
We're going to get my little girl.
Where is everyone?
Yeah.
Nah, I got the gun.
But it's got teeth.
With what just happened upstairs --
We're lucky to be alive.
C'mon guys--
Come on, come on.
OPEN THE DOOR!
You gotta be with me on this.
And the head?
Hey!
Shit!
Get in line!
No. You?
What?
Look.
Why don't you go check it out?
You weren't helpin'.
Go douche.
Who's with me?
He's dead.
My truck.
Yep.
Your parents of relation?
We lived near power lines.
Anyone else?
We gotta try.
Anybody else?
What?
Nothing, this was my last delivery.
Just cover me. It was built to move.
Well...
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
Will I go crazy or something?
I can't feel a thing, Hon.
The girl's got rhythm.
Sure.
How much you got?
How much I got, what?
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
He's dead.
What?
Huh?
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
What?
What do you mean what?
Huh?
Fully.
Four door?
Two.
Open?
How many?
Max?
Seven.
Nine?
Seven.
Keys.
Get outta here.
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
F-f-fuck you.
You smell like ass!
No bullshit.
What the hell's going on here!?
Clear!
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
Duh hickey.
Gimme the keys.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
Move slow and move quiet.
No shit.
You keep that key handy.
I'm fine! I'm fine!
If he doesn't shut up...
MOVE YOUR ASS!
HELLLLLLLLP!!
Get something on that.
BONSAI!
Amazing you made it this far.
Don't worry, you'll be like my little papoose.
HELLLPPP!
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
Ok. Let's see what happens.
Nothing, just lookin'.
She's not very nice, is she?
YOU'LL HIT US!
They'll tear this place down within the hour.
And the last one is the...
Father. The biggest, the strongest...
Whoa!
Wait God-dammit!
Not without you!!!
Go!!!
GO-GO-GO!!
That's one piece of four problems.
I'm fine, I really am.
I admire your strength.
We all have to be strong, right?
Oh...
I think --
Are you lying to me?
Well...
I said I'm not lying.
I just hit it like you said.
Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
What're you doing?
Putting on my armor.
Who's this?
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
Very fine bone structure.
Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude.
No, I'm concerned with everything.
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act.
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
I'm not!
You're afraid!
I'm not!
What?
Thank you.
Huh.
Frances.
Where's Clifford?
He's not here.
Oh.
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
An actress.
A rich actress.
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
Right now we have to be practical.
In my eyes, officer.
GET OUT!
You're under arrest.
Sort of.
There've been some calls.
Who?
Without me.
Showdown.
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
I gotta go now.
All square, Doc.
...Don't you?
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
No.
Were you a drug addict?
No. Never.
See you next weekend, Dad.
I didn't have much to do with it.
You wrote it, didn't you?
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
I know.
You really want to go?
Of course.
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
I love you too, Francie.
Daddy!
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
Thank you.
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
See you next weekend?
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
Oh Angela, my own... Angela!
Only if you were in it. Are you?
I wouldn't miss it.
Why... yes.
Then don't go to Hollywood.
Why?
No, I don't hate it.
...Not if I can help it.
What about your husband?
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
Harry.
You think I'd miss it?
Well? What'd you think?
Enh.
Don't be a rat, Harry.
Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
Quietly.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
You don't know what you want.
What?
Came to get a tan.
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
Eight stories.
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
I know what ability you're interested in.
Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
Yeah.
Well, the studio told me not to.
Is that why you did it?
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
I know.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
What's left of my blood.
Think I'll have a glass.
Help yourself. Everyone else has.
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it.
I'll bet.
You're coming.
Who said I was a lady?
You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
...Take advantage of me.
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
I guess.
You can't drink.
No. To thoroughbreds.
Will you marry me?
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
I know. Don't tell anyone.
I got your number, Mister Man.
Who?
Frances, it's me, Harry?
I love you too, Frances.
Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
How did I look?
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
Well... you're looking well.
No, we're not.
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
And no people.
Yes.
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
What'd you do?
Run!
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
Did you expect him to look you up?
Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
Who're you?
I live here.
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
The speech? Real good.
You think I got it?
You got it.
...You will.
Smile, little sister, smile.
Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
It's your fan mail, little sister.
You kill me, Mama.
What?
Go on...
Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?
Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.
Not long.
I'll be back.
At one. Promise?
Sure.
I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
Yes, Mama.
Mama...?
I'm going out!
You're not going anywhere!
No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
Yes...?
Don't I know you?
I don't believe so.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
Normal. Average.
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
This whole thing is a joke!
Stay calm, please.
You didn't say 'Symington says'.
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
Sedate her.
Good! Because, Brothers, that's you!
'Incurable.'
I was watching.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
You drove him to his torment.
And he drove me to mine.
Then why weep for him?
The music? Or the fire?
Why?
It can't be as bad as that.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
Friends? Do they live around here?
Yes. Very close
Why do you not go to them?
I am afraid.
Kill you? Hardly that.
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
I see it before me.
There is something I want.  A friend.
I'll be waiting. And watching.
A brain. Extremities.
What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
I will not! Kill me now!
She's not for you.
There, there... shhh...
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...
And you look so lovely.
It's been months. It's not like him.
I should go. I should leave today.
Fine.
Is he not back yet?
Aren't you?
Nothing can. Not ever.
It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
The world is a dizzying place.
Father's so proud.
And you?
I'll have to do better than that.
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
All my life I've known.
Is that what makes it so delicious?
I wish to be your husband.
I wish to be your wife.
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
Not as weak as I.
Your decision. For us.
I give you my soul...
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
Elizabeth. My more than sister.
They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
I'm all right. I'm safe,
Why the change? What about your work?
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
I do. But you must trust me for now.
Now husband and wife.
It wouldn't dare.
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
Oh God.
As a march hare.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
Can you think of a better reason?
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
It's a letter to my father.
Somebody has to!
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
You can't. Death is God's will!
That's blasphemy!
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
Thank you, Henry.
For what?
I didn't find what I was looking for.
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
What is your name?
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
Victor, explain yourself.
Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe...
The strain was evident.
Are you a physician?
How is it you come to be here?
You know of it?
Your men are right to be afraid.
Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
Madness?
I will protect you.
I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
Right! Right!
I was careless.
Good night, Brenda.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
You want to leave?
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
Thanks, Alice.
I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
You okay?
Artist.
I don't know.
Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
Well, it hasn't been that long.
Absolutely.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
It sounded like Brenda.
I'll go take a look.
They're off now.
Okay.
Marcie?
Hey, guys!
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
Wet. I don't know.
I meant everything.
I can't, Barry...
No, they won't...
I need you so much, Claudette.
Where'd you get that stuff?
For sure.
Don't get up. Take a second...
I had to.
Thanks.
Is it stuck?
Get behind him more.
I'll spot you five points.
Where's Ned?
That was the telephone.
Good call.
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
I love you.
I don't love Neddy.
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
Don't call him.
I call it my shower dream.
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
Mmmmmmmph.
Best over...
Umhummmmph.
There you are dead wrong.
Girls can't be cowboys.
Okay, Fireman.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
Those things can be nasty.
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
Aw.
One night on the town.
I mean...
Another coincidence.
Yeah.
Just my son and I.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
You said it was just you and your son.
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
Open the door. I'm coming aboard.
Have you ever been there before?
Yeah, follow us.
So let's do it.
Vamanos!
I have no idea.
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
Jacob.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
What's this about, money?
Come again?
That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.
Where is the little lady?
In heaven.
She's dead?
Yes, she is.
How'd she die?
Auto wreck.
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Yes.
You're a preacher?
I was a minister.
Was? As in not anymore?
Yes.
Why'd ya quit?
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
Didn't like it, did ya?
No, I didn't.
I can handle Richie, don't worry.
Why not, against your religion?
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
Suit yourself, more for me.  Scotty?
Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?
To yours.
Forever together.
Yep.
That happens, you'll get it back.
It's a flop house.
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
Scott?
No!
Everybody goes home!
Where are you taking us?
Mexico.
Mexicans.
What did I say?
You asked me if I would --
Do you believe me?
Yes.
You damn well better. Go.
Yeah, we got a bible.
Noooo!
Anytime.
Not many.
Me too.
-- you got your sink --
-- you got your shower --
-- see this, television!
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
I wasn't scratching!
You callin' him a liar?
You can't come in here.
This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!
Shut up and start the car.
One... Two... Three.
No.
Do they have a waterbed?
I'm gonna go get the money.
-- This conversation is over.
Cops.
Didya look at the border?
What?
What the fuck is she doin' there?!
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
It's not your fault, it's her fault!
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
What?
What?
No, I didn't.
You meant that, but you meant the other, too.
Or what?
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
I don't know, you just passed out.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
I'm lookin' scared?
That's what you look like.
You know what you look like?
No, Richie, what do I look like?
You're lookin' green.
Where are you right now?
What do you mean?
Where are you?
I'm here with you.
It don't look together.
Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?
Scarred for life, that's how I am!
No problem, lieutenant.
Just some of the women.
The woman I saw you with...
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
But are there... I mean, how many...
Don't say my name.
Who's...  Lieuten --
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
What'd you find, Kathy?
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
Jordan, dear.  How are they treating you?
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
No, sir, WHAT?
Straight up?
Across the board, sir.
So I'll get a fair shot?
You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?
Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
Sir...
No problem, sir!
West?
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
Hey.  Ain't your call, man.
I'll act surprised.
Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
California.
Yes, dear.
Sounds familiar.
Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
Should probably ask him that.
You'll think about my offer?
Do that.
'Snot me.  It's him.
... two... one... MARK!
Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
I'll try anyway, sir.
Not due in for 22 minutes, sir. Watcha got?
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
Probably hear back from CNN first.
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
Intel has its own glory, lieutenant -- no matter how subtle.
Just like you would be.
Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
I saw an article...
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
Sure.  I'll join the crowd.
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
What about him.
What?
Yeah.  Me too.
Well, now I feel so much better.
Made it to Week 10 last time.
Thanks, Wick.
Wick.  They got your crew, too?
At first.
You got anybody, Wick?
Not me.  You?
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
Sure, sure.
Just askin'
I don't know...
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
Smoke it!
You heard me.  Move on.
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
Any brothers?  Sisters?
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
Wasn't deemed a threat.
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
You think we should go easy on women, O'Neil?
No.
I'm so glad we agree.
Okay, O'Neil.  So you've impressed all the others.  Now try me.
15, sir.
Show us where you are, Chief.
Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
North?
Shut your hole, Slutnik.
Darth Vader reads poetry...
Somebody throw a tent over this circus.
So am I.
What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
O'Neil, Jordan.
Thought you two were file-closed.
You knew about us?
Sorry.  Thought you knew I knew.
Hmm.  Let's aim higher.
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
Great. See ya then.
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
Go in there. Talk to her.
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
Well, I can be tough if I want.
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
We know, Audrey.
Yeah. Why are you asking?
Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
Only one way to find out.
Oh yes he will.
But we can get to the west side faster.
You must have quite some harem.
What?
I'm sorry you feel that way.
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
What else do you know about it?
Are you sure?
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
You never said it was off the record.
Our network covers the Ranger games.
Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
Really? I'd like to find out.
Oh, just some insurance guy.
He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
Nick Tatopoulos.
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
Can I use some?
What do I get?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
You're kidding, right?
This is not the place...
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
And you're beautiful...
Mr. Caiman...
Call me Charlie.
It's your choice.
Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
Really? A girlfriend then?
No. Perhaps I work too much.
Well, I think you're cute.
Oh, thank you.  Is she always like this?
Me too.
Allez, allez!
That is when we will go in.
Where's Luc and Pierre?
They didn't make it.
And how should we do that, Sir?
That is our job.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Get your people out of there or I will.
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
You're standing on it.
It may be too late by then. These eggs will hatch very quickly.
That thing's dead. What the hell are we waiting for?
Thanks.
We've met before.
Oh yeah, the insurance guy.
It's the French Secret Service.
Oh.
I need you to trust me.
Why do you need that?
We, have already taken care of them.
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
Makes us look more American.
Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
Good idea.
It's okay. I know her.
It's Raymond.
Where are you?
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
Just don't.
...Yes sir.  Your quarters sir.
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
Where's my bed?
Right... Sorry, sir.
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
Open.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
I won't and nothing you say-
"The show must go on."
...Damn you!  Damn you!
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
Must be some sort of mining facility.
You go first! There's no time!
Nothing.
I heard something. A squeal.
KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!...
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
Yes. Good was done this .....
I played Richard III...
Jason, what have you gotten us into?
They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
The engines are dead. We're drifting.
Hey, watch that "Laredo" shit.
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
The guy is terminally selfish!
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
Oh can't I? Watch me!
Why didn't you stop at the market?
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
The ships are gaining...
Alex? Where are you going?
Nobody was WATCHING?
What?
By Grabthar's Hammer, this is true. 159	NT. LIVING ROOM - SOMEWHERE - NIGHT	159
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
What's  your name, son?
Brandon.
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
What does the Omega 13 do?
Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
What do you mean?
Wait two seconds then go.
Lt. Madison, GO.
Shit! Go!
GO Commander.
Up.
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
We're getting major structural damage.
What's the weather like outside?
There is no weather in space.
I never get tired of that joke.
Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
The enemy is matching velocity.
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
All systems are working, Commander.
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
Never mind, Fred....
No, no... I'll think on it...
Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
You... know us?
It's ... incredible.
Something BAD happened here.
It's... I don't know.
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
No. Keep all energy to the armor.
Hey, YOU want to drive?
We're doing episode 31?
Where'd they go? Back inside?
I think he just likes pointing at things.
What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander.
You smiled at me.
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-
But I'm the Commander!
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
Let me think. I need time to think.
I don't think that's a cloud...
Computer, can it be repaired?
Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Don't be ridiculous.
It helps.
Will you stop RIDING ME?!
Yes. Yes, I'm here!
Nothing. Hold please.
What the hell are you talking about?
Wait... Jason, Here!...
Mark 12.
TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
Almost as much as he loves himself.
Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
Wait, Fred, what about your thing, you know... "Digitize me, Sergeant Chen!"
Stop, please! I don't know!
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
Simpler.
We.. We lie.
Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
Catch me later, okay?
You... You mean Earth?
But what if Sarris survives?
Thanks
It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
... Maintenance facility...
NO, Thank God he has not.
Then how did he find out about the device?
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
Former Commander?
You what?.. What are you talking about?
Well... Sort of...
A model, only as big as this.
But... Inside, I have seen-
Push It. Hold it down.
Oh god...
Anything.
Tommy, we have these...
Okay, let's go.
Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.
It doesn't have eyes.
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
Pedal to the metal...
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Mark 20 Into the black hole,  areao.
Patience, Lt. . Patience.
Because they're coming right at us.
Fire at will. hI~D  NT. PROTECTOR
They always say that.
You seem pleased by the prospect.
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
It is.
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
That you would have known you can trust me.
Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
Yes, general?
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
Then use rocks!
I'll be twenty next year, sir.
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.
Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.
I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief.
Gag on your own invention, then.
Oh, come now...
You invented this, this...
If he isn't, then he's stupid.
Detained by what?
The British army, sir!
What's the difference?
What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.
They help me understand why we fight.
How can you say that?
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
The one with 'Philadelphia' spelled correctly is the counterfeit.
These supplies...?
And how rusty are these muskets?
General Lee, sir!
Get these men back in line!
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
Some things must never change.
Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
I don't want to see your hospital.
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
Yes, I thought that's how you'd feel, Nathanael.
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
But you are an aristocrat and a slave owner.  Sir.
Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
It is; we need you George.
Is that the truth?  Well, we can't carry on like animals any longer.
But not more than your comfort.
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
"Mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in chains..."
Africa, of course.
Well, we must be who we must be...
Let's get you darker!
You're out of your mind!
And dost thou live to ask it?
Voltaire, of course...
Just because they are born?
Yes!
Who says so?
I say!
I see...
Though, sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season.
He was not black!  He was... tan! Weathered!
Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
I reserved a Cadillac.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
You're kidding me, right?
You see that? The way the man just went right over?
Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
I mean I don't care.
Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
No. What's this?
Plan B. Here ya go, honey...
The money. Fuck. I gotta think...
Calm down, Bear...
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
You serious? This is how you guys do business? I can't believe you aren't dead.
So... how many movies you been in?
No shit? What're some of 'em?
Your who?
Yayo. Where is he?
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
Harry, let me answer that.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
What about her?
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.
What money?
In just a second. Two...
I don't believe this.
Three.
I'll find it.
In the can. That the money?
Bear, you're not really gonna -
You positive about that?
It's a different kind of deal.
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?
Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
That's the magic number.
Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately.
Who is this?
Okay. So who are you?
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Or else use your fucking imagination.
Look at me, Ray.
You say look at you?
That's correct. Look at me.
Sovereign.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
Get in line, bro.
Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
That's right.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
I'm in the movie business.
You're an investor, is that it?
You have a card in here?
Not yet. I just started.
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
Harry, lemme give you some advice.
I know what a marker is.
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
I said I had an idea, that's all.
I'm not the guy, Harry.
But you work for the casino?
Not really.
What does that mean?
Maybe a few times I have.
Ever shot anybody.
Really? You ever been arrested?
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
What do you get out of this?
Let's see how we get along.
Never say anything unless you have to.
Get the fuck outta my chair.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
You have it?
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Personally?
It was in the Herald.
Ask your man here.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
I'm thinking of a movie.
One of mine?
One we're producing.
With what? Wiseguy money?
Now you're squinting like you need glasses.
That's not bad.
Compass.
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
They report it to the IRS.
I'm up twelve grand today.
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
Who told you that?
Here's another tip...
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
Sit down, Leo.
At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
You broke in?
What're you doing here?
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
...That's what we finally decided.
I just caught the end.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
Not yet.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
What happened?
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
Are you going down?
I don't know.
You're as bad as Harry...
I'll go. I'll go.
Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...
You bet.
You don't act like it?
Go get your stuff.
Couldn't find my toothbrush.
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
Don't say a fuckin' word.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Whatta you doing out there?
I'm going into the movie business.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
Pick 'n' Save.
You seem to feel fine about it.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
Be quiet and listen.
I don't hear anything.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
I'm going.
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
No problem. You go on off to bed.
'We?'
Chili and me.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
But you are interested?
A passenger liner. Over.
Say again. Over.
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
Roger, North Island. Arctic Warrior over and out.
I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
With that coxswain dickhead.
Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
Sixty pounds.
What? You sure?
That's what it says.
Lemme see.
Morning, skipper.
I don't know. Tuesday?
Wrong. It's Friday.
After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather.
Why not.
What?
What?
Maureen.
Maureen?
Roger?
No.
Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions?
Bring it on, dude.
Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
Or uninvited guests.
What're you crazy?
I like my job.
Gimme a break.
Maybe he isn't alone.
Right. Wednesday.
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
What?
Get up.
Yeah, yeah.
Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
What is it?
Threw a turbine blade.
Turbine rotor's shot.
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
How much longer's that gonna take?
Like I always say --
The right way and the wrong way.
But how long?
Hard to say.
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
Goddamit, Dodge.
She take a radio?
What, you think there's something funny about it?
Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
Could be meant as a warning.
So whoever did this might still be around.
Murphy.
If they knew what they were carrying.
I don't know what you're talking about?
I think you know.
Maybe you can tell me then.
The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
What?!
Don't lie to me!
What the fuck -- ?
Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?
If money can buy what he wants.
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
Sorry.
Don't fall asleep.
Right.
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Too big. More like a freighter.
He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
Probably didn't have time.
That's what I call a payday.
You're a pal.
Because of the gold.
No.
Lights?
Sudden flashes of light.
I feel fine.
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
It's my pen name.
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
Only way to be.
Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
Did you see him?
There's somebody else on this boat.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
You sure it wasn't me?
We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
No cowboy shit. Right.
Yup.
Epps.
You just shoot at something?
Same. Any luck?
No. I'll try again later.
What?
But, who -- ?
But where's the damage?
If it was a ship she hit.
Doesn't matter.
Hey.
Couldn't sleep.
Wish I could say the same.
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
I don't know, are we?
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
That much I think we've already established.
More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.
I don't know.
Either of you seen Dodge?
Right here.
Maybe it was more than that.
We hit land.
What?
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
I think I see it pretty well.
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
Go.
Let the buyer beware.
What do you say, Dodge?
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
I must be in the wrong business.
You got that right.
Better than "making hamburger for Mickey D."
Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.
Looks like it's adrift.
How's that?
You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
You're up late.
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.
We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
We could call for help.
And get a bunch of fools sniffin' around here?
Supposing he wants to get bad with us?
Drink up then.
Lost my sea legs.
I wish I could tell you. I'd be real interested to know myself.
Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
A what?
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
Leave it.
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
Better late than never.
What's this?
No, no. You got leak.
Fifteen, at the most.
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula.
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Guess.
How should I know?
Who?
Give up?
YES.
Maxine.
Not the Maxine?
Yup.
God, how horrifying.
I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow.
What is it now?
Are you still looking for a job?
Nothing.
Are you going to yell at me?
Yeah, I heard about that.
I just buzzed him in.
JUST DO IT!
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
I see... interesting...
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
So what do you think?
I...
What do you mean?
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
I didn't check my messages...
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
It's not optional!
Jesus...
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --
Oh my God, that's HIM!
Hi.
Yeah, well... hi...
Can I come in?
What do you mean "why"?
When did I say I hated you?
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
Yeah, well --
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
Okay... I promise.
Hey Josh.
Are you ready to go?
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
Uh oh... don't turn around...
Forget it...
Just look at them!
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
We should follow them!
In fact, never.
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
That lets us off the hook.
Hey, look at this...
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
What does that even mean?
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
I've been looking all over for this.
What a little hosebag.
I remember every minute of that party.
There's my dad with Joanie.
You know, the green cardigan guy.
Oh yeah.
You're better at it.
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
It's still twenty-five minutes early.
I'm going to tell him you said that.
She says she wants to MMPH!
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
Totally! Look!
We should follow him home.
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
This kind of thing must happen to him all the time.
I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start feeling really bad again.
Come on, it's too late now...
Gross!
Ew, it's like some gross rat...
Forget it, I can't explain it...
What, is she black now?
"Hassle"?
As always.
JOSH!
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Should we leave a note?
It'll only take a second.
Everybody's too stupid!
It's a surprise.
Where did you get that?
You won't believe it! Guess!
Anthony's II!
No way... when?
You cunt!
He does that every single day.
God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
He gives me a total boner!
He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
...maybe we should be lesbos...
Get away from me!
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
Yeah, I guess... call me...
No, really...
God, you're really obsessed...
Don't you want nice stuff?
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
So should I come over?
What are you talking about? Who?
Just some people from work...
I don't believe you.
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
He came into work.
Why? What did he say?
When was this?
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life!
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off.
It's fine.
So where's all your stuff?
That's all you're bringing?
I dunno...
Maybe an orange juice.
It just came yesterday...
Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
Just because.
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
See, that's exactly the kind of thing we're trying to avoid. 
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
Well, bye you guys... CONGRATULATIONS!
What are you doing here, Melorra?
Who does?
I thought it wasn't for sale.
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
It's kind of falling apart.
Where did you get those pants?
Punk rock is over!
I know it's over, asshole, I --
That tape sucked, by the way!
I'm so sorry if you were offended!
Get a job!
Norman.
Fine, and how are you?
Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
Later, "Dude".
What?
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...
A dollar seventy-five.
Okay.
Watch my stuff.
NO!!!
Hey, I was only kidding!
I'm totally serious!
Yeah, well...
I really didn't get a good look at her.
PLEASE? We have to!
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Fine, I'll go by myself then...
OH MY GOD!
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...
What? Why?
Are you okay?
Never...
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
Hi, it's me...
Oh, hi...
So, what happened?
YAAA!
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
And you like them?
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
Does that mean you don't like me?
No, of course not.
So, do you like me, Seymour?
In what way do you mean?
In whatever way you think I mean.
I had to see you.
What's up?
Uh... sure... come in.
Do you have anything to drink?
What about this?
I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
What do you want?
I-I-I...
I will if you want to.
No... forget it...
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh?
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
I wish I could see him.
Call me sometime.
Talk to us about it...
It's a tampon in a teacup...
Right, exactly!
No... they said she was here...
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
I don't know... where is she, then?
Maybe she's with Josh?
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
I don't know.
Why? What did she tell you?
I have no idea - I just want to...
Did she say that?
On that pathetic fake blind date.
What are you talking about?
What fake blind date? What are you talking about?
Yes?
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
Let me see the sick.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
There is no reason for fear.
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
As are they all.
-now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so-
You're right. The Devil has come. Look at me. I am the Devil.
Am I to take it you want to live?
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
Don't they, though?
So work must be going well?
Well, I need to speak to him.
It hasn't been that simple so far.
-not a time for modesty, Bob-
You don't enjoy killing, do you? 
Then why do it?
Nigel and I don't like each other much.
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
You intend "sorting this out" tonight?
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
We have hunted since childhood.
Might be exciting for you.
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced.  Why not, indeed! 
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent. 
Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands- 
That's what the books say... 
What did I do?
Got me out of trouble.
We need to talk.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
Has it ever done that before?
Have you ever failed?
Only in life... 
I got big. 
You think they'll come then?  Why?
Good luck.
Why?
The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
This is more difficult-
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
Thank you, Samuel.
Good news?
Do you love her?
I do, actually; very much.
You give me hope, John. 
Oh yes. But it takes time.
You've known him long?
Since his beard was red.
Once... 
Underneath.  Somewhere.
I don't believe you had a mother. 
Four should do it.
They will want a lot of money.
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
Hold your son high. 
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
Do you ever see him?
Occasionally
How is he these days?
No.  Not that I can recall.
Thank you.
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
You're also a human being, Frank.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
Okay, that's no problem.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
Oscar!  You poor kid!
Unusual?  I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.
I'll supervise.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
Thanks.
Oh, hello, Peter.
You're really good, you know.
I don't know what to do anymore.
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
Finally came to your senses, huh?
Same difference.
So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
I know.
Then why have you come?
Yes, the scourge --
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
I command you.
I await the word of Vigo.
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
You've got to stop them.  Please!
Get on with it, counselor!
Did I forget something?
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
You were the one who got me in.
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
Hello, Venkman.
I don't even want to know where that is.
Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard.
I knew that.
You need the exercise.
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
Ostrov?  I've been there.  Good party town.
Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
His nickname is "The Hammer."
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
No, the slime is rising.
And it's all flowing toward the museum.
There's something very familiar about this painting.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Oh, Ray --
Dana!  Dana Barrett!
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
I'm Peter --
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
I hate Jello.
Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
She's new in town.
Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
I'm ready.
Then let's do it.
Huh?  What?
You finished here?
What?  Yeah.
No, I just thought --
Well don't think!
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
And decent.
It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Have I done the right thing?
What's the matter, dear?
Well, you're doing great.  Keep it up.
Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.
Hi, Louis.
Are you sick, Louis?
Hi, Louis.
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
I am Zuul.
Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
It's in the stars.
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
That's a violin concerto.
Yeah, but it's got a great cello break.
No?  What do I act like?
Like a used car salesman.
Thanks.  What's in there?
Nothing.  Is that the kitchen?
Well, let's check it out.
I'll wait here if you don't mind.
I told you, I ...
I know.  It happened by itself.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
I think I should spend the night here.
That's it.  Get out.
On a purely scientific basis.
Out!
I want to help you.
I'll scream.
Don't scream.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
Goodbye.
No kiss?
You heard it?
You're the best one in your row.
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
I want you inside me.
Whoa!! Nice voice.
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
We'll get back to you.
I think it's the food of the future.
Remind me not to go to lunch with you.
In the physical sense.
What is it?
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Are you Peter Venkman?
Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
You could say that.
No, you may not.
Because you didn't say the magic word.
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
The magic word is "please."
Why do you want to see it?
Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
A square?
Good guess -- but no.
Close -- but definitely wrong.
Yes.  I don't like this.
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
Sorry.  This isn't your day.
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
Then my theory was correct.
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
What on earth gave you that idea?
What have you got, Egon?
Don't cross the beams.
Why not?
Trust me.  It will be bad.
What do you mean "bad?"
What is it?
Oh, shit!
Gozer.
You talked to Gozer?
Full-stream with strogon pulse.
No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
But it's my favorite state.
We'd better adjust our streams.
Neutronize.  System shut.
Looked at with your eyes.
What do we do now?
What do I say?
To go into business for ourselves.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
No sense worrying about it now.
Where are you, Pete?
Third floor.  Get down here,
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild.
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
How do you know?
I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
What?  What popped in there?
Look!
Mmmhmmm.
Me, too.
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
Judgement Day ...
Yeah, Judgement Day.
LATER, MAN!!
That's what you told me two days ago!
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
I'm tired of being stuck in that wagon.
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
For the gods, spit it out!
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
You're coming back?
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
But I get what I want, always, don't I?
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
Not yet, dear brother...
Send them out!
Perhaps, Master Galen, you may say.
Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political.  Not a Republican by any chance?
Apparently my opinion wasn't needed.
And my army would have thrown your body into the Danube.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
I'm serious.
So am I.
I wouldn't know who to bet on.
He left us at dawn.
Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control...
Jerses -- tomorrow...
But have never been?
We all know what right is, Senator.
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
You don't know how wrong you are.
My loyalties... were in doubt.
They can't... if this is Rome...
Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.
But you do exist.  Narcissus:  hero of the battle of the Danube.
He killed his father and then my family...
Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive.  All of them.
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
They fear me.
As soon as I can.
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
Well, they die for it!
I was summoned.
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
They're studying with Cynics.
Of course...
I can see that...
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
Quintus is overly idealistic.
Chain him.
-- to fight?  We'll see...
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
That's one way to look at it.
You get to come alive again in the country!
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
Then get a large cash advance.
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
Something else, then.  Do the chariot races interest you?
Hello.
I'd love some.
No.
Why not?
I don't know.
No.
I think I'd better go home now please.
Where is the car?
I just want to tell you something.
But could I just tell you this one thing?
No, I couldn't.
No.
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
Wait a minute.
Is anything wrong?
Of course not.
Yes.
Yes.
With a family?
Did they ever find out?
No.
And it's all over now.
I'm glad.
You do?
Benjamin -- I really do.
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
Because I want to know what's happening.
That woman --
What?
That woman. The older woman.
You mean the one who --
Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
Oh my God --
GET OUT!
Don't cry. 
Get out of here.
Ah. Where?
At the Zoo.
No.
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Yes.
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
Here he comes.
What?
Is it because I'm here?
What do you think?
I think it is.
All right then! Yes!
Well, I want you to leave.
Elaine -- I love you.
I don't understand --
Let me go.
Because it isn't true.
I don't feel well.
Elaine -- that is not what happened.
My belt.
Don't you have it on?
No.
Well -- where are you going?
I don't understand.
Goodbye.
Will you kiss me!
But you might.
I might.
When?
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
You mean you're confused?
I don't see how we can.
We just can.
I'll think about it.
You really will?
Yes.
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Why wouldn't it?
I just don't think it would...
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Well -- I said I might marry him.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Shhhh.
Where did he do it?
No.
The day after tomorrow?
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
What?
Hello -- who is this?
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Is the doctor anywhere?
I certainly hope you --
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
Ben.
Mr. McQuire.
Are you listening?
Yes I am.
Plastics.
Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.
Not exactly.
I said -- not exactly -- no.
What are you then?
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
One of those outside agitators.
Oh -- no sir.
Who screamed?
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
It was just a visitor. But it's all right now.
You heard me. Out of here.
What for?
Because I don't like you.
Could I make one phone call first?
Yes.
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
I'm in the bathroom.
Well here's the purse.
Well I'll hand it to you.
Will you bring it in to me?
I'd rather not.
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
Did you get a room?
What?
What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
The Singleman party, sir?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
It's in the main ballroom.
Ahh -- thank you.
A single. Just for myself, please.
Will you sign the register, please?
What? No. Nothing.
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Where is it?
What?
Where is your luggage?
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
Sir?
Is what a girl?
Whatever it is you're upset about.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
That's right.
Will you take me home?
What?
Let's go.
Right.
What?
No.
What do you mean?
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Did you know that?
Look -- I think I should be going --
Sit down, Benjamin.
What?
Pardon?
What do you think?
Well I don't know.
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
What is wrong with me?
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
Her portrait?
Yes.
No.
Yes?
Will you unzip my dress?
Oh. Well, goodnight.
Won't you unzip my dress?
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
I know that. But I'm --
Come on.
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Then why do you keep running away?
Don't you think he trusts us together?
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
On that chair in the hall.
Get away from that door.
I want to say something first.
Jesus Christ!
Do you understand what I said?
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
Because I find you very attractive and any time --
I've got to go.
Yes.
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Of course.
A drink? Of course.
I haven't. No.
Do you want to?
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Do you want to get it now?
Yes.
Well -- I don't know.
Why don't you get it.
That's fine.
Yes -- I think that would be good.
I'll be up in five minutes.
Well -- goodbye then --
Yes?
Yes.
What?
Thank you.
Benjamin.
Yes?
Oh -- sure. Thank you.
A hanger.
What?
Either one will be fine.
Okay.
You're welcome.
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
You what?
This is all terribly wrong.
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
Is this -- what?
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
Are you kidding?
Wait a minute!
On your first time --
Who said it was my first time?
That you're afraid --
Anything. Anything at all.
Well?
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Don't you?
You're not interested in art?
No.
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
Yes I do.
I got up.
What?
What novel did you read.
I don't remember.
What?
There's no risk?
He's asleep.
Always?
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
Calm down, Benjamin.
Now let's keep going here.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
Thank you.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
Man, is this interesting.
Is it?
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
Well how do you feel about him, then?
What?
Well, wait a minute. You married him.
Well I can't.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
At college.
Yes.
What was your major?
Why are you asking me all this?
Art?
How do you think.
I'm curious.
We'd go to his car.
Oh no. In the car you did it?
I don't think we were the first.
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
Don't talk about Elaine?
No.
Why not?
Because I don't want you to.
There's nothing to tell.
I was just kidding around.
Good.
But why shouldn't I?
I have my reasons.
Then let's hear them.
No.
Well, I'm not.
You're not.
You're goddamn right I am.
What?
Don't start acting hurt.
Of course you did.
Of course I wouldn't.
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
But it's not.
Yes. Please. I want you to.
This is absurd.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
Then you'd better start believing me.
Where is Elaine?
I don't think so.
Sir?
Very good, sir.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
Goodnight, sir.
Yes, but I'm afraid --
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Hey -- I don't get it.
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
No, I do. I want to tell you.
What else?
Nothing else.
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
I do.
You believe me, don't you?
No.
You don't?
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
No -- they don't.
Well -- when did you decide all this?
About an hour ago.
-- worried?
Well --
I guess -- about my future.
What about it?
Different.
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
No. She doesn't know about it.
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
What?
I've got to go.
Ben -- how old are you now?
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
I know.
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Yes, sir.
Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
Why?
That's quite a statement.
Don't shout at me, Ben.
Mrs. Robinson?
Yes?
It's Benjamin.
Yes?
Benjamin Braddock.
Benjamin -- where are you?
Yes, I can.
Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
They are?  Come on.
It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
I don't believe it.
That what he says. Right?
Not now.
Yes, sir.
No.
Why?
No -- no -- no -- no...
Why?
No --
With the pearls --
You can't.
I'll pay you back.
How?
You might find a bullet through that head...
Not with strangers.
You're a fool!
Yes, I am rather.
Who?
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Have you seen it?
Oh -- work!!
Oh!
Dictation.  You know...
No -- why? -- should I?
Money -- Ever heard of it?
What?
Free --
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
Where downstairs?
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
You're very funny --
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Of course.
Really?
Sorry.
Chasing what?
Money.
Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
Will you do me a big favor?
I'll do anything for you.
Would you like to make a man happy?
Yes -- I'd love to.
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
I feel sorry for him.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
You live here?
For tonight. 
Oh!
Yes -- oh!
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
What do you want here?
Nothing -- only to be here.
Why do you hide in my room?
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Because you love me -- you love me?
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
Yes -- tired...
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
Strange man...
Am I quite strange to you?
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
You are beautiful!
No.
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
That's a silly joke.
Oh -- 
I'll not denounce you.
I know.
So --
Yes -- yes -- yes.
Yes.
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
I'll go -- good-bye.
Shall I see you again?
I --
When are you leaving Berlin?
Very early in the morning.
Why later?
I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.
No?
Why?
Don't.
On the train?
Yes -- I will be on the train.
Not at all, sir. 
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
Oh, a Baron! 
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
Where the music's playing and the ladies are...
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
A little strange, Baron.
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
If the Baron -- if you would permit me --
If I could get into a game I might win some.
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
We could come to my room.
Ready, Baron.
No -- not at all.
All right then.
All right then.
You've lost everything?
I've no luck.
Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again... 
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
Well -- last night was not so good.
I thought she was splendid!
Yes -- but the audience.
Yes, I was in the war.
Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
I did not ask your advice.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
Don't do that. 
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
I don't know.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
No, Doctor.
Telegrams?
No, Doctor.
Anyone asked for me?
Nobody, Doctor.
Oh -- but -- I --
You're tired. I can see that.
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
Stay where you are.
I'm engaged for the evening.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --  Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five o'clock. 
Yes -- that --
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
A man might what?
I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
She's beautiful -- isn't she?
You're trembling.
I never danced before -- in public.
You dance splendidly.
Really?
Oh -- what -- what -- 
Yes, of course, -- money!
You don't understand that do you?
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
Do you like me better?
Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.
I'm the stenographer.
Then you will please wait outside.
Moreover --
Moreover...
No -- only occasional jobs. 
Tired?
You pay me.
You're a very unusual stenographer --
Moreover...
Moreover... 
I got ten marks for that.
Me.
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
That's from skiing.
Skiing? 
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
What?
You're a little too fast.
Can't you understand me?
I understand you perfectly.
Have you got it now?
Cotton Company --
...weight into the balance...
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Definitely off.
That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. 
Hello!
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
It's urgent.
No -- now.
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
Yes.
Well?
A thousand marks -- 
Insolent young cub!
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Well, he's a gentleman!
I had to arrange about the trip.
You think so?
Here, hold up!
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know.
I mean with the Manchester people?
No water -- What a place!
All you have to do is phone for it.
Of course you took the initiative.
And I said we didn't.
You've decided against the merger?
Yes --
Then, it's all over?
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
Under these circumstances we might refuse to sign.
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
We did not approach you.
You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
He likes to play the great man.
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
You see -- what we are interested in --
Ah, come on -- we're going home.
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
Let us cancel the engagement.
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Send it away -- I shan't need it.
Good morning, Madam.
Oh, yes, Suzette.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
Yes, madam Suzette knows all about it.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov? 
Oh!
Take them back, Suzette.
You haven't time.
Such nonsense.
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
I know -- I know -- but it will be sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest then.
The performance -- the performance -- the performance. 
What -- what is it? Last night...
Last night?... There was no applause.
There was -- there was.
Good morning, Gru -- your --
Yes, Pimenov.  One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
Please.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
What is this insolence?
Me?
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
Yes, the police must be called.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
You are late. Hurry.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
Have I kept you waiting?
No news yet?
No. No word.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
That.
Pretty as a picture.
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
You wanna talk to me straight up?
My son was in the hospital --
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
You expect me to buy this?
I'll loan you a raincoat.
You mean, the insurance frammis?
Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
You'll never shit right again.
You want a drink?
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
Roy? He's always crying.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Do you have something around back, facing away from the road?
Right in front of the room.
No problem. My husband gets up the crack of dawn.  It's his kidneys.
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
Henry, no!
Can't move.
Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?
I can keep my mouth shut, Mister Fellowes.
These machines -- They're in here.
Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
Why? What's wrong?
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
I'll get you a check.
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
Hello.
Roy Dillon.
No?
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
Perk, remember?
They twisted my arm.
Only one arm?
Only one tooth?
Don't mention it.
I guess I owe you my life.
You always did.
No. And you have to be.
Get off the grift, Roy.
Why?
Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.
We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
Roy, I don't want money from you.
You do?
No. That was the point.
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
You, too, Roy.
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
I just came back from Phoenix.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
Just a few bucks.
And Myra's stuff?
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
I'll get it.
That's right.
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
We'll work something out, Joe.
You taught me a lot. Then I invented.
I can't. I just left home.
You're too young. You should be in school.
I am in school.
In your other hand.
Always, for you, baby.
Taking you for granite?
Let's find out.
Mm?
Look at me.
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
Roy? It this all we have?
All? It ain't bad.
No more than this?
I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
Oh, yeah?  Thanks.  How long do they say I'm in here?
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
Every day in every way.
I'll see you when you get home.
You ain't seen nothin.
See you soon.
Oh, come on, Roy.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
Myra, I'm not following this.
The long end. Big con.
Nobody does that single-o.
He retired.
Where?
Upstate.
Upstate where?
Atascadero.
Sure.
Open your door.
What?  What for?
Open it and find out.
I went out to Delmar.
I saw her.
She didn't see you, in other words.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out.
But the setup's there. It's there now.
I don't think I need it.
No! Because I --
That's what I say.
What?
For Christ's sake, why not?
I'm happy the way I am.
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
Yes?
That's natural.
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
You up to it now?
Sure. Let's get it over.
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
No question, huh?
No, its -- Why did she--?
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
That's true, Mr. Simms.
Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
I like a woman who takes control.
That don't match either of the victim's.
The cemetery...
Only the real stiffs.
Charming.
Care to join me?
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
Sweet dreams, Blake.
The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
Do I know you?
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there.
It's Amy Kramer.
My god...
What the fuck are you talking about?
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
Would somebody shut this guy up?
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
I think someone broke into my house.
No shit.
Checking out your place.
No.  Wait for the police.
And miss the big game?  No way.
Betcha' didn't predict that.
I know.
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
It's an option.
Just forget it...
Why didn't you tell me?
I was trying to protect you from this...
I don't know.
Get on the bus.
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Just get on the bus.
I'm not leaving without her.
John, you can't help her now.
What?  Where is she?
John...
Please, get on the bus...
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
You stole it?
I borrowed it.
Why not?
I can't afford to get caught.
I came to see you.
I can see that.  Why?
Can I come in?
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
Then you come out here.
Then I'll get caught.
Alright.  I'll come out.  Just be quiet.
I'm okay.
Here, take my jacket.
Yeah.
Who?!
Michael Meyers!
Looks great.  It does.
You okay?  You seem a little off.
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
It's always John.
Still wants to move out?
This kid just wants his freedom.
It's not going to happen.
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
What?
What are you looking at?
I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
Michael Meyers.
The serial killer?
He's my brother.
I can't believe this is happening.
Shit happens.
I'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms...
You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
I have to pee.
Can't you hold it?
Can't you?
I did alright.
You're unbelievable.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
Shit, Linda!
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
Where's Shane?
Have enough fun for the both of us.
Oh, don't be such a victim.
Pig.  What the hell happened this time?
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
He's in the bathroom.
Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
We can light our own tree at home.
Then they can watch.
Answer what?
What if it's Kara?
The voice man!  He's here!
He says things.  Bad things.
Like what?
Okay ... But just for tonight.
You can't expect us to stay here --
No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
I promise.
Danny!!!
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
You knew, didn't you, John?  You knew.
I've come to help your family.
Found this morning.  In a field outside Haddonfield.  Stabbed.
It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
You stay away from him!
Here.  Let me try.
Not just Kyle.  All of you.  His entire family.  Here.  Look at this.
He's gone.
Kara, no!
Wait a minute ...
It's not working!
Retiring.
You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
It's a sign.  He's come home.
An old friend.
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
I'll meet you over there.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Why did you take Jamie?
Leave the boy.  Take me.
Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael Myers come home?
I dunno, boy.
Hm?
It's a bitch.
A bitch.
Didn't recognize you.
We've never met.
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
You know what gets me?
No.
Must have changed that law.
You know what gets me?
Oh, shit.
At least we found the diamonds.
At least!
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
Go home!
The hell with the diamonds!
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
I'm liable to find anything!
You know what gets me?
Let's talk about it some other time.
How short the skirts are.
Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
You ever own a motorcycle?
Let's talk about something else.
I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
First Nagasaki--now this.
How about breakfast, wife?
She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
You know me, boy.
You told me.
When?
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap.
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
You never played a violin.
You did?
You.
Okay.  Okay.
You're an imbecile.
I know you think that.
Everybody thinks that.
I don't think so.  It could have been.
How are you, honeybunch?
The posies are for her?
I wanted to apologize.
You've come to the right man.
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
I forget mine for years on end.
Oh my God--  And you are Looseleaf Harper.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
Pass the fucking catsup.
You actually sold insurance!
Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.
I just want one true adventure before I die.
You're making a joke.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
For what?
For Africa.
To make an ass of yourself.
What went wrong?
You're hollow, like a woman.
I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
As a matter of fact--
Sir?
Hello.
Are you--do you--
Ask it!
Life has denied me that thrill.
Do you mind if I ask who you are?
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
He worships Father.
He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
College!
What's good about that?
It makes life spicy.
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
Tell me some true stories about Dad.
Oh hell.
Dad was never in England?
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
Mhravitch.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
No, no, no, no, no.
Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.
Why don't you go to bed--son.
I can't take my eyes off you.
Penelope!
Mom?
The smallest thing I've got.
Can I get dressed first?
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
Leave a tip.
Who was it?
Nothing.
That's a rifle you have?
No.
Open the bolt!
I don't want to fight you.
Yeah.  But it's going to get loud again.
Heaven.
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
Eighteen--  and a half.
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
Daughter--I love you very much.
You don't even know me.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
This is crazy.
Give us time.
Like hugging a lamp post.
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
Situation.
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
We thought a doctor might help.
Your old beau?
We thought it was an emergency.
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
We all are.
Shouldn't you lie down?
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
I was, I was.  It never lasts long.
Thank God!
Say hello to your mother.
Do say hello to your mother.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
It's so--so stark.
You used to like it stark!
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
Turn around?
Ram it up your ass!
People don't use that word any more.
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
They don't have to feel like slaves.
Then go now--and fry with dignity-- sunnyside up.
What then?
Tell me about its sexual roots.
Yes.
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
And he keeps it in his apartment?
I don't think so.
Why not?
Sneaking in the back door.
If he wants to go.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
Did you like it, dear?
Almost a Christmas scene.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Just one favor.
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
You're begging him to kill you?
If he thinks he's man enough.
No you don't.
No.
Ah!  The lady is armed.
There it is.  Give it to me.
Load it for her.
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
Ooops.
Gentlemen--that's nice.
You startled me.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
He's dead, you know.
Hello, Mother.
We'll miss you so.
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
Will you please go?  An emergency!
She still has just the one child-- the boy?
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
And her fianc!
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
She's crying because she's so happy.
What a brilliant diagnosis!
Pacqualinincheewa root.
Would you say that again?
Everything about you is the editorial we.  Take that away from you, and you'd disappear.
You were wrong, you quack!
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
There's a certain amount of information there.
It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
Oooooo.  That hurt.
Now who's being cruel?
And terror, if you don't mind.
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
King Arthur.
You hope.
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
I've struck my blow.
With spittle?
My violin is avenged!
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
I'm utterly satisfied.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
What is this thing that kills me?
I've enjoyed being man.
Get up.
No.
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
It's trash now, like mine.
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Leave the rifle here.
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.
It was a bitch.
Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
She did?
You didn't even find that out?
There was so much going on.
Jesus.
Alice is dead?
No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
What will you do, Colonel?
I'm only ten years old.
I heard you were looking for me.
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
Premature ejaculation.
Something's made you sore.
Don't worry about it.
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
Don't!
Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
What a relief!
I don't want to live any more.
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
Oh, Paul--
He's a ghost!
He's alive!
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
A what kind of doctor?
You're the only woman he ever took out.
Still lives with his mother.
In a railroad accident many years ago.
I was afraid to ask.
A lot of people don't.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
I don't really know.
It's beautiful.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
No.
Then who flushed the toilet?
Father's friend.
What's his name?
Don't know.
For Heaven's sakes!
That man is your father.
What?
I don't get it.
It is you, isn't it, Harold?
Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
He can hardly talk.
Then get him.
Okay.
You're taking Mom out tonight?
You're going out?
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
It's fine!
Keeps fairies away!
He isn't any friend of Father.
He isn't?
He is my father.
No!
That's something I suppose.
Something happens to my confidence.
Yeah.
Is he all right?
Is he coming home?
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
Marry me instead.
Take plenty of cigars.
The what?
It's suicide!
Paul's only twelve years old.
That's been said before.
We met here earlier this evening.
How neat.  How keen.
I believe in miracles now.
It's really that bad?
Goodbye.
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
Or get eaten alive.
It's good.  Let him go.
I feel like I've been double- crossed.  If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday--
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
You mean I'm black?
No, just not the type.
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
Big threat. TV would ream you.
I just want to ask some questions.
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
Well, I want to...
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. My name's Felice.
What?
What do you mean?
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before.
I'm getting angry. I want some answers.  Where's the guy who runs this place?
Yeah.
We offer...
Yeah, yeah...
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
I don't know no Tod.
What girls you got here?
That's all you got, three girls?
Man, how many girls do you need?
That's Charity. She's out back. She'll be free in half hour.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
Yes. I think it'll look better.
If you say so.
Yeah. How did you know?
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
The other girl is the star?
She thinks so.  What do you do?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
You making a feature?
Um-hm. Live sound.
Do you know where she lives?
Tod might know.
Where's he?
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
You're not a film producer, are you?
How much do you make a week, Niki?
Something like that. How much do you make?
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
Half now, half later.
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
When do we start?
Huh?
Ulcers.
Of Joanne's?
Yeah.  I'm her father.
Jesus.
She's dead.
You won't keep growing at this rate.
You know what I'm talking about.
'Sucking off.'
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
Neither am I.
But it's all you do.
How important do you think sex is?
I care about my daughter.
Tijuana.
They were here?
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
What does that mean?  What does he do?
He deals in pain.
Is Kristen safe?
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
What the crap?
Yeah.  Well, mostly.
I thought I was fucked up.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Where does he live.
On your own land?
You wife isn't dead is she?
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex.
Where is he?
I can't tell you that.
Where is he, Niki?
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
So then, Mr. Mast...
Andy.
You are.
That's right.
Mr. Van Dorn?
Mast?
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
In G.R.? Why?
What are you paying me for?
I'll be there.
I don't know.
What do you mean?
That's like a stag film.
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
They're legal now.
They are?
I don't know.
Where did you get that film?
What do you mean?
Do you think she's safe?
Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
Get out.
But this is my apartment.
Who is Ratan?
I just heard. Who is he?
Does she know anything about this?
Just leave me alone.
But I'm here to help you...
Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
Pretty good.
How did you find me?
What?
What is going on?
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
I don't know.
Where!
What you got in mind?
I want to meet Ratan.
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
Rucker.
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
Take it or leave it.
Okay.
You ain't goin' nowhere alone.
Who?
What?
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
They're all about the same. You want something?
I don't know what you're talking about.
That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
I don't know nothing, man.
That's all right.
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off?
He asked me. You going with anybody?
I don't know.
You ever play Chicken?
What's that?
You never heard of that?
Com'on, tell me.
Well, a boy goes like this, see.
Oh.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
To anybody.
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
Granville's looking for you anyway.
Who's that?
Well, he can just fuck himself.
You're taking a big chance.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
You working in San Diego now?
No.
Thanks.
Yes, I am.
And what are you studying?
Eh, Poli Sci?
Oh, I don't have one.
Come again.
How long have you been driving?
No, no. I just took it.
Took it?
Hello.
None of that, lady.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
Possession of a stolen shovel.
Officer, I can explain.
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
Then whose name is it registered in?
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Where are the papers?
Because if you are...
Lady! Be quiet.
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
Not very.
I'm a file clerk.
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
What do you see?
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Eh, no.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
No, thank you. I have my car.
What?
Do you sing and dance?
Eh, no.
No.  I thought not.
Your hearse?
Yearse!
Oh, look! The birds.
Well then.
Sort of.
My door is always open.
All right.
Promise?
Maude???!
Eh, fine.
She seemed yare to me.
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
It goes on and on.
Oh. Eh, I like it.
Because they are all the same.
Oooh, but they are not. Look.
Look.
What?
Over there by the courthouse.
What is it?
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
But we can't just dig it up!
Exactly.
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
Is he all right?
What is that he's working on?
Well, I really don't drink...
No more revolts.
But I don't play anything.
Superb.
Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
Yes. It's almost there.
Yes.
Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
It's all right.  It's organic.
Okay.
It's so blue.
Pray? No.  I communicate. 
With God?
No. I'd feel stupid.
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
What is it, Harold?
But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
Well, don't go.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Oh, you weren't scared.
Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience.
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
Well, they're my species.
Yes. They're old friends.
Maude.
Yes.
Here.
I took them out.
Why?
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
You haven't changed a bit. I'll put it in my wallet.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
Oh, Harold. 
For you.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
It's true. I can't live without you.
"And this too shall pass away."
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
To a girl. Here.
A sunflower?
Can't complain.
No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
No. My uncle.
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Like a tea ceremony?
No. Like this.
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
And why is that?
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
A rough estimate.
Yes. It does.
Why?
And a lot of time.
You mean when I'm not working on a...
Yes. What kind of things do you do?
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
None at all?
Well, maybe one.
Yes.
Your classmates?
Your studies?
Yes.
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
Why?
What would you say?
To pit your own life against another.
Another man's life in your sights.
ZAT!
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
Oh sure.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Well, I don't...
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Souvenirs?
Harold!
She took my head.
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Oh yes. That's fine.
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Well, I didn't.
Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?
We've always been here.
We have no more surprises.
Frank.
I knew you'd come.
You knew?
Oh, I do. I do.
Shit. Bull. Shit.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
No. You look...
I know.
She certainly has.
It's coming.
It certainly is.
I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
You a doctor, too?
What?
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
What do you mean?
The boxes! I TOLD you.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
Yeah. The things you were talking about.
Kyle, you don't have...
I've got to finish it.
Finish what?
It's been Hell.
Then why are you here?
I've come for my father!
Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.
You were ALL human!
Yeah.
The Cenobites.
Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
We don't take hints.
I'm lucky that way.
I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
Didn't even buy me a drink.
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
See? I don't like that --
-- Hound of resurrection?
Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
Three days too late for that one, "professor."
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
Oh, I'll bet you have.
Air and sea backup. What's closest?
No. It's not.
C'mon -- Rasputin??
No. It was red. Bright red.
I think that is its hand.
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
Me?? C'mon --
Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --
Is it bad?
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
Oh, as opposed to -- ?
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Did he, now?
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
Okay. You saw the fish man, right?
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
Noooo! Noooo!!!
Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then.
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
Each of us gets a belt.
I won't take 'em. They never work.
No. Don't --
I'm in charge. We go back!
My job.
Oh-n-no -- I --
No one ever helps me. It's my job.
My arm is fine. Where are you??
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
Yes?
Goodbye.
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
No. I never was.
Could've fooled me. Go away.
That's right, Stud, hold me down.
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
Hey. You: think twice --
What landed you this job, pushing "pamcakes"? Punctuality? What was your area of expertise?
Shh! Just a second.
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Start in, you got nachos coming.
Not hungry.
Not from you.
Well good n-
Good night.
How big can it be?
Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
Goodnight.
No. Myers is taking me.
Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
Good.
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John.
Strong.
A brute.
I know.
What about you?
Coffee's warming me up.
What?
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Yes, I --
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Pardon?
Two steps back, please.
What's the problem?
My fucking hand!
Hi.
Want to buy a bed?
Not much.
We're leaving.
Where's my father?
Do you really need this bed, lady?
Julia's my second wife.
Lucky man.
It's just a puzzle box.
Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
You did this before, right?
Many times.
To a man called Frank Cotton?
HE did. I've seen him.
Stay the fuck away from me.
You can keep them.
I have to speak to my father.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
Kirsty?
You remember.
No.
Come to Daddy.
You want it?
This isn't happening.
Some things have to be endured...
Poor baby.
That's right. Who are you?
I'm brother Frank.
Oh.
I came for the wedding.
Oh.  Oh yes.
Well can I come in or not?
But you said --
I don't want to see the dress.
Forget him.
Sure you are.
Don't look at me.
Who are you?
I said: don't look.
Tell me who you are.
Frank.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
What happened to you?
What do you want me to do.
Hurting.
One more. Maybe two --
Keep your voice down.
You're hurting.
What?
Tell me, damn you.
You promised me an explanation.
A box?
What kind of doors?
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
You would be. They tore me apart.
I don't.
So where's the harm?
I said no.
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Don't you care?
Maybe we should just leave --
Well we can't just stay here --
I need a skin. Then we leave --
Hi. I got soaked.
Just to your left.
Where's Daddy?
What's the problem?
I have to see my father.
I was here this afternoon.
I saw everything.
Oh my God.
O.K. O.K.
Like who?
Just a thought --
Ah!
It's just been empty a while.
The best part of ten years.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
So what's the argument?
No argument.
Oh Christ. Julia...
In here.
We'll move in Sunday.
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
I cut myself.
Shit.
Let me see.
I'm going to throw up.
No, you're not.
So damn stupid.
You're done worse.
I'll be scarred for life.
No you won't.
I'm here.
Sweetheart... I've been calling you.
Just feeling a bit sick.
Oh, babe...
Maybe a brandy.
Sure.
O.K.
Kirsty.
Fine.
Only I'll turn it off --
No. I'll do it.
What's wrong with you?
Don't go upstairs.
Come with me then.
Please...
What's wrong with you?
Please. I can't bear it...
I don't know where to begin...
What are you talking about?
It's better you see for yourself --
What?
Drinking alone.
Not much.
I wonder, maybe...
Just soda.
Plain soda?
Please.
Oh?
I suppose that's right.
I... suppose so, yes.
That's more like it.
No, not much.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
No personal details?
That's right.
No.
We don't need a bed, do we?
I prefer the floor.
That's right.
Am I?
What happened to me?
I'll get the doctor.
Wait a moment --
I won't be a moment.
Try me.
Daddy?
I got through.
Where are you?
I found a room.
What did you say?
I said: I found a room.
You'd like the house.
YOU'D like my room.
Do you want me to come over?
I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
Of course. Every day.
Take care, Dad.
Call me tomorrow.
I will. See you.
You like?
Me like.
Kirsty.
Sure.
Steve?
Yeah.
I love you, honey.
I love you too.
Maybe you should give it some time.
Of course.
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
He's gone.
Gone?
I don't believe it.
I'm afraid it's true.
I want to see.
No you don't.
Yes!
Show her.
What's the problem?
PLEASE. You're in danger.
No. It's all over.
That's right. Cointreau.
So lie down.
Just upstairs.
I AM house-trained.
I thought we'd lost you.
I'm coming!  Sleep well.
Not that late.
All right.  No. That's nice.
If there's a train.
I see.
She's so damn... English.
Meaning what?
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
We're not all frigid.
Oh no.
It's not what I heard.
Are you alright ?
I've been better.
If I make it through the day.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
No, it's good to see you.
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
Can I lend you a hand?
What happened to you?
Don't let them take me, Steve --
I won't let anybody take you.
Will you GO, damn you?
'Bye.
I don't know.
Really.
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
Play it.
Say it.
"Little Latin Lupe Lu."
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
Well what's the point in that?
Oh, so what's the point then?
He offended me with his terrible taste.
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
What do you mean, "what?"
What are you snickering about?
I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
What am I missing?  What do you have to be happy about?
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Terrific.
What the fuck is that?
My band.
What band?
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
You're not even coming?
Ooh.  Drag.
Haven't seen it.
Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
No way.
Yes way.  It's really...
What?
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
No.  We need the gig.
What do you think?  Dick likes it.
No, you can't.
Do not get ahead of yourself.
NO--!
It's the new --
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
Nothing.
Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
On Clark Street!
A couple blocks!  About six!
We work there!
You'd love it!
He's not worth it!
No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
Oh, hi.
Where's Rob?
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Uh.  That's me.
Your desert island top-five.
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Is there a difference?
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Is that it?
Sure, but is that it for the list?
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Yeah.
What's his name?
Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
Hey Rob.
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
Good weekend?
I'll tape it for you.
No, that's okay.  Really.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
Can I help you?
Yeah.
I want a tape.
-- FUCK OFF!
Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
"Abraham, Martin, and John." That's a nice one.
It's Vince and Justin.
Who's that?
You look upset.
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Maybe I should talk to him.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get a drink.
Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian.
Think about it, Rob.
Think about it, Rob.
We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
I should be so lucky.
Hi.
Hi.
Just the obvious stuff.
What's the obvious stuff?
I don't know.
What, what?
No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
Rob.  Don't be childish.
-- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
It sounds stupid.
Nevermind.
You won't like it.
Just ask it!
Is it better?
Is what better?  Better than what?
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
I haven't felt like it.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
Great... That's great.
Have you slept with him yet?
I told you I slept with him.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
It's me.
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
You don't ever think about other people?
You still together?  Going all right?
Mmm hmm.
Sure they are.
Well, think about it.
Hey, how ya doin'?
Pigsty.
Who the fuck's Pig?
My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
In a minute.  When I get it together.
Yes, of course.
Mmnn.
You're also an idiot.
What do you want to do?
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
I didn't mean that.  I mean... was that all you used?
Okay.
Want to know what, exactly?
What it was like.
You know the difference.
Oh, great...
But what?
Harder.
Hi.  What are you doing?
Nothing.
Wanna go to dinner?
Where?
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
Yeah.  His band is playing a set.
I know.  I don't get it.
Not really.
I mean it.
I know.
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
No.  Probably not.
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
I don't know.
Very persuasive.
Are you persuadable?
So?
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
Hey.  It's Liz.
What's happenin'.
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
What difference does it make?
Is Ray going?
Enough of what?
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
Everything go alright?
Thank you.
Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
Nor have you!
Yes.  You?
Yeah.
Good.
That way.  You?
That way.
Right.
Everything all right?
Great.  Super-fantastic.
How's the store?
So so.  Up and down.
What do you mean?  Where did she go?
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
Then what are you getting so upset about?
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
Thirteen hundred.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
And I won't take a penny over ninety.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Oh really.  You two are slamming to Nico now?
Well we don't.
Whatever.
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
Find the father.  That should clear things up.
Go to hell.
This one came unassembled.
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
It's in good condition.
It's my birthday.
Happy birthday.
Thanks.
No thank you, I'm fine.
Why?
Carl Smith.
You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
Anything in Maryland is close.
Yes.
Very traditional.
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
Basil the II.
Good day, Miss Cartwright.
Probably.
Who?
Does Carl Smith?
I've been to Church Hill.
Tradition.
Dupont Circle.
At the moment?  Carl Smith.
And you?
Not your concern.
He was innocent.
You?
You are being foolish.
Are you?
No.  I had to talk to you.
You had to do _nothing_!
You're wrong.
You're a fool.
Maybe.
Not all of them.
When you finish, what then?
I wish I could.
They do it each year.
There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
A little dusty.
That's impossible.
I hope I never get that old.
I'm not even sure why.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
Just a little crazy.
That would be difficult to explain.
I'd like you to try.
He knows about you.
He is older than I.
I didn't kill the watchman.
You killed those other two.
Not the same.
What about that family in '31?
Sometimes innocents become involved.
You kill with your left hand?
I haven't killed _you_.
Is that a threat?
Come here, Brenna.
Damn you.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
All of it finished.
No!
Not power.  Not control.
I'm just curious.
You and I should talk first.
We've got nothing to say.
All fashionably without heads.
Spare me the details.
I want Taupin.
What were you doing in Felton?
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
It's that important?
Yeah.
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
Why?
What are you doing man?
-Et lux perpetua-
-Auditorium nostrum-
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Stop!
Your name is Conor?
Aye.
You're not from these parts.
Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
I was nearly killed.
It was time for our paths to cross.
You feel you know me.
I don't know why.
We are brothers.
You are still so very young.
I'm twenty-two.
Not even a single lifetime.
We are immortal.
No!
This is madness!
It is the truth.
No!
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
You'd have to die first.  Aqui.
You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.
Oh my God.  Oh my God I'm lost.
Again.  Try again.
Go to hell.
Muy Bien!
It's like to kill me first.
And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.
I have no future husband.
What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
Who?
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
You're not talking sense, Mara!
Like you.
Certainly not me.
It's all we have.
Romirez is dust.
Finish yours?
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
Mulet.
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
Second musketeer.
You seem to understand a great deal.
We have no understanding.
It never changes, Major.
Stay out of it.
Don't threaten me, Private.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Either you are with me or against me.
Have you time for some- thing to eat?
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
He's a MacLeod.
My father taught me.
Your father must be smart.
Yes, he was.
Yeah.
No.  I want this to be all ours.
What name is he using?
How many came?
The last four.
And the Bulgarian?
He knows I'm here.  How?
Head still secure to the neck.
How did you find me?
Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
He always did.
-Since you last saw me.
You were never a kid.
You're insane.
Not so long.
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
Of sorts.
MACLEOD!
As you wish.
This isn't done.  Get up.
What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
It's all we have.
Go to hell.
Leave her alone.
Get up.
Are you here?
I want you to come to me.
And if I refuse?
Should I care?
Yes.
That's none of your business.
You're wrong.
I presume it's a sword.
For the moment.
Where were you Tuesday night?
Home.
He's mistaken.
But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
His only kid.
The resemblance is amazing.
When may I expect the cleaners?
I'll send them right up.
Same.
Just your pappy scared some.
Why don't you fellows get your own news?
Well, congratulations! Good luck!
That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
Open this door!
Excuse me, I just want to --
The poem?... The poem was great!
It doesn't have to rhyme!
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
Bon jour!
Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
Better make that a certified check, Walter.
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
I lost my wallet.
The check, Bruce!
The Criminal Courts Building.
Well, the story's practically finished. I'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger.
Hello, Bruce...
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --
Where'd she go?
Out some place.
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
Yes!
Then who are you?
No. My mother.
I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
We could take the six o'clock train, Hildy. If it would save a man's life.
You haven't seen anything yet.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
I'm beginning to realize that.
Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
Gee! Take a look, will you?
Get out!
I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
We'll take a chance on that, Burns.  Go ahead, boys. 
No, you don't!
Do you want to get us scooped?
Get out of here, you!
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
The power of the press, huh!
What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
I haven't any hard feelings.
You can break it, can't you?
No, I can't.
Sure you can. Come on.
Just what I said. That's what I --
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
You bet I've got a better offer.
Sweeney.
Dead?
Keep away --
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
I'm not working for any other paper!
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
Bermuda.
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
He's in the insurance business.
The insurance business?
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Say, could I meet him?
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
You're not afraid, are you?
Afraid? I should say not!
Now you got me.
Thanks.
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
Yes. Where is he?
She jumped out of the window.
I know. Where is he, I said.
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
We'll lower it out of the window with pulleys. Quit stallin'.
Huh!
All the words you've got.
Where's some paper?
Call him a love-child, if you want to.  Duffy!
All right, Walter.
Railroad tickets.
Is he coming back here?
Finished!
Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.
What did you do with her?
What happened?
You been in a fight?
Louie!
Was she? Did you notice?
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
Come here. See if we can move it.
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
What is it? Here!
Murder, uh?
Who did you talk to?
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
And your arrest. You'll each get about ten years, I think.
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Flip a coin.
Then why are you doing it?
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
Walter, you can't do that!
You -- you!!
You know you did!
You grey-haired old Judas!
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
Western an' Thirty-fourth.
You got plenty of money?
Sure, boss.
I always have both.
I'm busy, Duffy.
He's on my phone. He just called me.
They can't do that to me!
Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
No more interviews. Besides, a doctor's coming over.
I think it is.
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
It's a deal. Let me up.
They're always after me for interviews.
Me, too.
Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.
Point the gun at me!
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
Three bullets! Any good?
Beats king up.
Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
All right -- all right!
Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
Give me a hand with her, will you?
Okay.  Up you go, Mollie.
What's the use? I can't win a pot.
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
Who engineered this getaway?
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
I'll have it in a minute.
Three sixes. Is that any good?
So long, Hildy.
Now, where is he?
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
I can't complain.
Little rum in yours, too?
I guess so.
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
Good coffee, isn't it?
That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. I've got to get started on my interview. See you later.
Hold her, boys!
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
Nobody's trying to put anything over on you. I'm getting out of here and you can't stop me!
With a bag of marshmallows.
He can't hurt anybody. You've got his gun.
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.
Earl Williams. The reprieve.
No, I couldn't do that.
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf --
I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
What do you mean -- through?
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
An attempt to ruin us!
Cover up that transmitter!
Now what do you say?
Just -- one -- second!
Shoot to kill, I said.
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
A sight for sore eyes!
Throw him out, Frank.
I never saw him before!
Go on -- shoot me!
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
You'll take fifty and like it!
My name is Louis Peluso.
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
Was I? The driver got knocked cold.
Who is it?
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
Give me that!
I'll go right after it.
And up a dime.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
I thought so, too.
No -- what?
What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
First you got to sign a receipt. 
Where's the money?
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
That's good.
Mother!
I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Isn't that her picture?
Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
I won't, Earl. 
Put down that gun, Earl.
How'd you get here, Earl?
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
Quiet, Mollie!
I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
Never mind! Just play dead.
Shut up, you!
The reprieve for Earl Williams.
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
Who do you think!
The City Sealer's office!
You mean here in the city?
Yes, yes!
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
For heaven's sake, why not?
Is it hard?
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
You can't bribe me!
You're insane!
A very fine-looking women.
Hello, Mollie.
Come on, fellas.
Say, Hildy...
We want to see you.
-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --
What's he want?
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
She and Mollie were talking.
So it was. Sheila. This boy will go far.
I know.
But Grandpa, you said...
Very well, Grandpa.
Only till they get you into the local school.
No, she didn't.
Yes, you was. Make him talk.
What's that?
Who told you that?
I don't mind.
Do you know any swear words?
Say them.
Sod.
Bloody.
Bloody.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Would.
You couldn't.
Could.
You do it. You're a girl.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
We thought it was poison.
Who with?
Pauline.
He's the worst liar.
They've got the real thing outside.
It's not the same.
It's Canadian. Where'd you get it?
Thank you Billy, from the baby and me.
The sodding water table.
Air-raid?
I don't know?
I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
Bugger the Buffs.
I will if you will!
And I'm still just a lad myself.
Don't bother to grow up. It's no fun at all.
And absent bridegrooms!
And the bride.
What's that?
Oh, that.
Jam.
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
It looks....foreign.
Jam is jam! It's just jam!
You taste it.
Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
After this dance.
Half the time he's bluffing.
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
Don't leave it like that. Go after him. Swallow your pride.
It's not. It's happening to me.
Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
Or what?
How are we going to cope?
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
Play something, Grace.
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
That's right. Not since then Not since I got married.
Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
We did all the proper things, and we lost love. That's sad, Mac.
You might still have a house.
Look after yourself, Grace.
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
Am I? Maybe I am.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
Cone.
Huh... what cone?
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
What about R.J.?
Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
No, I told you...
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Oh, he's coming, he got something real special this year.
Who's your Daddy!
Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
Couple more miles up this road.
Oh yeah, the tree.
Come on.
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Is your brother ready to go?
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
Yeah, come on.
You sure do a lot of guessing.
You're welcome.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
Whoopie fucking doo.
Nice.
I was just wondering.
Wondering what?
Do you believe this fucking girl?
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
You shouldn't a done that.
Why? You gonna do something about it?
Yeah, I'll do something.
Now, what makes you think that?
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
Ummmm... two hundred and eighty-five dollars.
Hey, wait take this.
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
But if you did.
I don't.
She's pretty cute.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
Really fucking awesome.
How much further?
Way out here?
Cat fight, cat fight.
Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
Well, technically I did what ya said.
You're a real fucking piece of work.
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
I know, this is fucking nuts.
Here he comes.
He won't move.
Turn that fucking radio off!
Yeah, showtime for what?
That food...  ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
Lock the fucking doors.
Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
There's a dog in the road.
There's not enough room.
Then run him over, he'll move.
What!
Fine! I'll go straight!
Don't worry, I'll be quick. Just stay here, no sense everybody getting drenched.
Just sit back and enjoy the show.
I gotta open the gate.
Drive through it!
It won't work.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
Grab Mary and come inside.
Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.
Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?
That seems likely.
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
I don't know, I think he's funny.
Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
Rise and shine.
If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
You got to be fucking joking.
I can't believe...
I don't know... about half an hour.
What? I didn't hear anything.
Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
I still don't.
Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
Recover any bodies?
Not yet.
That's the understatement of the year.
You find something, Georgie?
Yep, I found something.
Keys.
Open up the trunk.
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary.
Didn't ya think, Mary?
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
Aw, honey you know I can't do that.
You said it, not me.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
Please, just a minute.
Wait, I want to say good-bye.
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Shhhh... you hear that?
I ain't got a warrant.
Shit... fuck procedure.
Call Wydell.
Yes, sir.
I'm Wydell... this is Naish.
I pray to God there is.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
Aw, fuck.
What.
Call the chief... We found 'em.
That must be him.
Excuse me for a second.
We found one.
That is the wrong fork, young man.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
It's going famously, son, famously!
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
Great.  God, I've wanted you forever.
Gabrielle.
Like father, like son.
French?
Oui.
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
Not at all.
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
You are sweet.
Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
Gabby, what is it?
Very well.
Stop. Get away.
What is it?
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
But I don't know how to leave Lila.
Hi. It's Nathan.
I just want to talk.
God, you're beautiful.
No. You look so beautiful.
Anyway. Come already to the point.
No!
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
I don't know. Something's missing.
Oui.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
Please let me go with you.
Okay.
Shan't happen again.
It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Very well.
Good. I'll show you how, apey.
Ouch. Yeah?
You still in the market for a real boy?
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
Shut up and tell me.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
Loves animals. Loves you.
What do you mean?
Won't he be able to tell?
My brother says he likes you, too.
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
No. I married a midget.
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
Three foot one.
Be still my crotch.
Stand on a stepladder sometimes.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Rose, please go away.
Lila, I want to help you.
Nathan told my brother.
Your brother should have his license revoked.
Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair?
Ready!
Oh, Rosie.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
Yes, and...
You really enjoy my company?
I like you, too, Nathan.
You do?
I'll be out in a minute.
I'm sorry about my parents.
Why certainly!
I don't think so.  Why?
Oh, and the sun block?
Of course.
Fifteen.
Flares?
Absolutely.
What?
I don't know. Something.
A deer?
It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
Nothing. Be right out.
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.
Good. Making progress.
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
It would just be helpful to know.
Do you like my new look?
Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
Sure. Of course.
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
That was wonderful!
Oh boy!
Thank you very much for that.
Ummm. It's good.
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Eat shit, thumbtack dick!  Thank you, Frank. You're the best.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
Tomorrow, the acid test.
Even better.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
Yes?
Yes... Derek.
I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines.
Yep.
Pittsburgh?
Mm hmm.
Comin' in or goin' out?
Next game, ten bucks.
You want a chaser?
You look different... More relaxed.
Soon as I finish my coffee.
I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?
And a fact is a fact.
She's a smart girl, Eddie.
We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
To win.
For whom and for what?
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
You tell me.
Thank you.
It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
Good, good.
You ever played billiards before?
Oh, about five hundred.
Do you really think you can beat him?
Twelve thousand.
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
What did he say?
Sit down.
Cut.
Deal.
Two.
Only when I work.
Yeah? Why?
Poker's not your game.
Pool.
You being cute?
Yeah. Sure, sure.
Maybe he knows how to drink.
Eddie, you're a born loser.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
Seventy-five per cent.
For who?
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
I don't know when it was.
Hi. How's business?
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Man named Turk Baker?
You know everybody, don't you?
Sign up.
Where do I sign?
What happened to you anyway?
Like I told ya. My thumbs.
Thinking about what?
Miss Packard. How do you do?
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
What's that supposed to mean?
Where?
Over there by the bar.
Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
Well, I win sometimes.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
How much?
You hustlin' me?
'Bout even.
When do I raise the bet?
I don't know.
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
All right. Five hundred.
They're fine.
I said we're leavin'.
All right, then. I'll play him with my own money.
It's a long walk.
I got time, Bert.
You want me to tell her for you?
You gotta be hard, Eddie.
Well, here it's half.
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
I'm a businessman, kid.
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
Who's he?
You name it, we shoot it.
Want some free advice?
You well-heeled, partner?
I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Fast and loose, man.
In the gut, I mean.
I feel tight -- but good.
Charlie, I'm gonna take him.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Eddie...
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
Get with what?
You don't need a drink.
Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
I asked around.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?
Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
What for? To play Fats again?
Yeah, to play Fats again.
Yeah, that's what I think.
Yeah. Just like that.
Well, hello. Haven't seen you in a long time.
Glad to meet you.
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
That's right. When?
Would you like to come out tonight?
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
Yeah, sure has.
Yeah. You must come again.
Yeah. Sure.
Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
Who's he?
Half and a dollar.
Gimme ten bucks.
A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
You're a pretty good player.
How much are you ahead?
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
Shoot.
Okay.
Call it.
Heads.
Yeah, I'm quittin'.
Yes.
What?
Since four.
What bus?
Yours.
Eight o'clock.
Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
Fair.
Can I sit down?
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Then why go to the bus station?
No, not always.
I used to be an actress.
Yeah? What do you do now?
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
So why go to college?
What do you do on the other days?
Hey!
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
Fifth of scotch?
A day like any other. People come, people go.
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
Come here.
How did you know my name was Sarah?
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
Okay. So what's your name today?
At school. It's Thursday.
Oh, I forgot.
When you've got money, you'll pay.
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Eggs. How do you like them?
I've got something in my bag.
Haven't you opened it?
No, why should I? It's yours.
No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
What's this supposed to mean?
Give it back to me.
That's right! And I'm sure you'll help me.
Me. It's Eddie.
No. You?
He knows. A lot.
Why did he tell you?
Is he a winner?
Does it bother you? What he said?
You need the words?
Yes, I'm glad.
Nothin'.  Want another drink?
What do you want to tell me?
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
Oh, I don't know.
A week? A year?
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
Sure. Let's go home.
Oh, grow up.
Why should I?
I'll be up later.
Just for luck.
I'm a little tired.
Yeah. That's right, too.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
You name it.
Thousand dollars a game.
That is not now, human!
My name is Robert.
With them?
We move.  Place to place.
Dark and large.  With vines -- no, not vines.  Not alive.
My wife.
Yes.
Where you lived with them.
Yes.
You want to kill them.
If I'm a hunter it's because you taught me to be!
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
I know it.  What do you want, Robert?
Have you always had it?
I don't know.
Have you looked inside?
Yes.
What's inside?
Humans.
Who?
I don't know.
Yes.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
Well, it's not supposed to be done anyway.
What?
Please.
Only got one kind.
That's fine.
You got that right.
I guess you could say that.
Round back.
Yes.
Do we have to?
That's the Air Force Base.
If we want it, it is.
Let's check it out, Dad.
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
Let's see what's on the other side. Maybe we'll find some copper.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
Sure ... fine.
Was there anything over the hill?
What, Jim, what?
First lemme look at your necks.
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
It was so real, Dad.
I was so scared.
Better now, son?
That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
I left it at work.
Yes -- but ...
He was upset with moving, I believe.
Is that all he said?
May I ask why?
We were having a little talk.
About what?
Can you tell me about that?
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
Why?
'Cause he wouldn't lie.
I don't see anything.
No, but it was here.
But it's not, Jimmy.
No.
Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
The State Police.
Hide the car.
I know a way.
Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
What happened to your other slipper?
What? -- I... 
The back door was open.
What's his family background?
It's really nice of you to help us.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
You have to leave the White House.
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
Connie, don't hang up.
David? How'd you get this number?
Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
He's not going to listen to me.
I take it you've heard.
A toast to the end of the world.
He's a good man.
Better be. You left me for him.
Did it work?
Punched the President? Oh my god.
My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
Then get them out of there.
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
So sue me.
Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
What's the bad news?
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
And the good news is you won't charge me.
What're you talking about?
Haven't you been watching?
Just do it!
That signal. It's a countdown.
A countdown to what?
Checkmate.
So think already.
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
College nickname.
You try Martin?
It's perfect the line is busy?
He wasn't the President then.
I'm making a mess.
This I can see.
What'd I say?
A cold? Of course.
We'll meet you there.
Just getting a feel for her.
Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
I can't shake her free.
It's not me. They're overriding the system.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
I don't hear no fat lady.
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
Then God help us.
She should be shortly.
ETA with target; four minutes.
Better than we thought.
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
How long would their shields be down?
No Sir. Definitely not.
How do you know?
Well, er... it's slowing down.
It's doing what?
It's... slowing down, Sir.
He's doing a good job.
They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
Be careful.
Dick-weed!
Butt-munch.
You know me...
Yeah, but what an entrance!
Dick-weed.
Butt-munch.
He's my angel.
Was his father stationed here?
Oh. Sorry.
I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
I didn't even see them fire!
Command, Eagle One. Switching to "sidewinders." We're moving in.
We're already over Mach 2!
So push it!
Jimmy, stay with me.
It's all fuzzy.
You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.
We're leaving.
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
Deploy.
Air... water... your "sun."
And before here?
Many worlds...
What do you want us to do?
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
You are on your own?
Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...
And I am his.
Papers, sir. Got it here.
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
Did you say...? Uh, uh...
You've got it!
All my life!
I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!
What is it?
It looks like a converted church.
Dad was onto something here!
Yes. Now we know.
I'm going after Dad.
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
Arghhh! Oh!
It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.
What?
It's war.
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
The Name of God...
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.
Where did this come from?
Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
You could be more right than you know.
We already have. Your father is the man who's disappeared.
You know something, Doctor Jones? You're absolutely right.
We're through!
Yes?
I knew it was you --
Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
I usually don't.
I usually don't either.
In that case, I permit you.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Lower me down.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
Are you sure?
Pretty sure.
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
What?
You said go between them!
I said don't go between them!
Mine, too.
What were they looking for?
The Grail Diary.
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
Don't know. Think of something.
How do you know?
Where is it? I want it.
All I have to do is scream.
I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
Out!
It's important!
Then wait -- count to twenty.
No, Dad. You listen to me --
Don't call me that, please.
But what are you doing here?
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
Thank God!
Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
Right.
Well, what was left of him.
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
If only I could have been with you.
There were rats, Dad.
Rats?
You did!!
Look, can we discuss this later?
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
Will you take it easy!
Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior??
Don't worry. He won't.
She talks in her sleep.
So did I.
My lucky charm.
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
Try and burn through the ropes.
What???
And the chair.
What?
Dad!
What?
Dad!
Head for the fireplace!
Oh.
I'm out, Dad!
...the solution presents itself.
What?
My Diary's in Berlin.
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
Booby traps?
Marcus would agree with me.
Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
I was the next man.
Ships that pass in the night...
We didn't talk. We never talked.
And do I detect a rebuke?
Dad, how can you?
Very well. I'm here now.
I don't know. We'll find out.
Fly... yes. Land... no.
What happens at eleven o'clock?
Thanks.
I know, Dad!
It happens to me all the time.
Dad, we're well out of range.
You call this archaeology?
Get out of there, Dad!
Junior...
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
The penitent man is humble...
I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
Me?... Illumination.
Junior?! Dad...
We named the dog Indiana.
Ready.
After you, Junior.
A long time to wait.
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
Come on -- come on!
I'll take the camels.
I don't need camels.
No camels!
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
My soul is prepared. How's yours?
No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
My name is Kazim.
As I said before, we'd be happy to escort you to Delhi.
Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
Oh -- good. And maybe the present Maharajah is a little younger? And thinner?
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman...
A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
There are no stories anymore.
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
Sorry, I thought we were just talking about folklore.
Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.
Lao She.
Nee chin lie how ma?
I don't like to show off.
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.
At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
Step on it, Short Round!
Okey-doke, Indy! Hold onto your potatoes!
Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --
Okay, Shorty.
It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
That's it. Pankot Palace.
Just a statue.
You don't like him do you?
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.
Behind you!
Read you loud and clear, Indy!
What?
You're betrayed Shiva. 
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
You will go to palace there.
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again.
I don't understand. What's happened here?
I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.
Hey, he's not a waiter...
Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
The old man saw it in a dream.
That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too...
Their children?
A SNAKE!!
Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
First of all -- don't panic!
It's pulling me deeper!
Don't let it curl around you!
Can you move your arm?
It's starting to let go!
That's good -- you're doing fine.
I know the feeling...
I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
Just try and control yourself.
You mean we have to walk the rest of the way?
Maybe he likes older women.
I've never been so hungry in my life...
No -- real food.
I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
Dr. Jones?
You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
What -- the bug?
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
I am -- it looks horrible!
I'm going down.
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
So now they believe me.
Yes, they believe you.
There's got to be another way out.
Go!
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
You got it!
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
What for?
I know you did!
Who's you?
Al ???!!!
You're not gonna believe this...
Try me.
I'm...inside you.
What's going on?
Don't do that.
It wasn't him.
Who was it?
Me.
Who?
Al.
Yes?
This candid camera?
Your name is Al...
Yes.
I see...
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
Do me a favor, Al.
Yeah?
Where are we now?
My place, can't you see?
No.
Nerve bundle! What are you doing? You just leave the nerve bundles right where they are.
Who am I?
Yeah...Who?
What are you doing in my head, Al?
That a new Datsun?
I just went there for a job.
Then how'd I get here?
You said it.
Loading a gun.
Kill myself.
Are you crazy?
Yep.
Hear voices don't I.
Of course you do!
Why he's argumentative?
With a man in my head...
Who was that? Somebody out there?
Why not?
I'll talk to them.
I'll tell you what to say.
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
Outrun them.
This is a Fiesta!
Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
Then what are you stopping for?
Too late...They want you.
Why? AL  You know too much.
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?
No. Don't tell the guards.
Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!
Why?
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
I am. You are.
You are CRAZY!
You gotta help.
I did. I brought you back here.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
I'm not gonna make it easy.
Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
I'll sue.
We have to get out of here.
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
Go out, take your first left.
Just walk down the hall?
With Authority!
What does it say.
Corridor A.
Where are we going?
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
The man.
Black suits and helmets.
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
Nothing!
I'm at the airport.
Good. Get to a phone.
What am I supposed to do?
Nothing. You just do nothing.
Send a man there. A secret agent.
You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
We get on a plane.
We get on which plane?
What about it?
I don't have any.
I can't do that.
Why not?
It's illegal.
Who cares?
I'll get in trouble.
You are in trouble. Now do it.
We'll change your appearance.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
You'll be me.
The beach.
The beach?
...Just beautiful.
Good Idea!
The sand.
Eat it.
I don't want to eat it.
It's sand.
What? What do you mean?
Are you screwing with any nerves?
What was?
A girl.
You're out of shape.
She's beautiful...! What do I do?
What's happening?
She doesn't seem to understand.
Try another language.
Which language?
How should I know?
What can I do? You're on your own.
Don't just stand there, say something.
.
Wait.
What?
No...you idiot!
...Rene...
To the hotel. To register.
Without your pants.
Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
Yeah. I did it.
What are you looking at?
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
This...is not going to work out.
Not blue enough.
It is my business. It's my name.
But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.
Why not?!
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
The beautiful one.
You have no taste.
That place. By the window.
The drinks...Stay on them.
Just hold them close and stay still.
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
Killer!
I don't know what's going on.
It lends you an air of mystery.
How do you know?
Voice stress analyzer.
She's the toughest to read.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
This just won't work.
You're doing great with her.
Not her. You!
What is it?
What if she says something important?
You got any books in there?
Oh come on.
You shut down your sensors.
Joe! It's 56 hours!
I don't know!
Shit! You're in love.
It's not your time. I get time off.
You get time off to sleep.
It wasn't like that.
Why don't you get out of my face.
Better. I found Ryuji.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
Osaka?
Fountainhead of High-Tech.
Follow her.
On what?
Run, stupid!
I can't keep up.
Just stay here and rest.
Where are you going?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Al, you leave my heart alone...
What do I do?
Relax. Let me do this.
It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
You think. That's what you're good at.
I told you, I have a feeling...
One of your instincts?
Don't worry!
Too late.
Drink lots of water.
You have to! Quickly!
...imagine a better grape for the region.
I can't see a thing.
Neither can they.
Never mind, just say it.
You were with GRUNER!
I don't trust her.
Come on.
I've got an idea.
I was afraid of that.
Not sure at all.
Just say the words. Just like I told you.
You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.
haka xuki. What's that mean?
Cash.
While he makes the run.
Where?
I can't handle that thing.
And don't let her know, either.
What exactly?
I don't know.
Losing power. The laser drained it.
Where've you been?
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
She works for them.
Now, you're too suspicious.
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.
You've changed your mind.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
Yeah, sure.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
I want to thank you for what you've done.
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
Aren't we all.
What part what?
The best part. She'll love it.
Don't give her your name.
Oh, I can't.
Good.
Don't worry.
Let us get to the border!
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
In him?
It's a long story.
ya hyutn slulptsa?
What a nerve!
Then how did you know?
I dyed it. We're all getting old.
**?!! 
Newer, more powerful design.
They took the tapes.
You have nothing...
Surveilliance on them all.
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
We met on the beach.
Join us.
I have a new client.
That crazy guy?
Yes. Joe.
He's not an ordinary man.
He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!
We insist.
That name's familiar.
It is to me too.
Well...I try to give them whatever they want.
I think I've heard of you.
Your memory.
What about it?
It may have been affected.
Oh.
You may not remember things.
When you do...
Do what?
When you remember...
Remember what?
Who...are you?
Fine. You look fine.
Thanks.
Well...
Well what?
We're here.
Oh....Sure.
I will?
What?
Oh yeah, thanks...
Why would we want to hurt you?
Not you. Them.
Who?
I don't know Who.
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Not...complaining, actually.
Been hearing voices.
You...him...UST.
I noticed you staring.
Just give me the keys.
Whatever it is, don't do it.
This sophistication ain't tough. All it takes is a credit card.
Yessir...very good sir.
What's what?
What do you want?
Nothing.
What?
Then who did?
...I'm looking for someone.
No. No one to speak of.
I am confused. Or maybe it's you.
Blake?
Where?
Dinner...tonight.
Oh...I can't. Business.
...right here too.
Haven't seen you around.
Do what?
Let you leave without it.
Without what?
Like there's someone else here.
...Rene.
Yes, of course.
Me still. They left you alone?
I waited for you.
Why?
...I...don't know.
Disinterest?
I am sort of scattered.
You are.
Are you alright?
That you're not crazy.
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
Why do you do it?
If I was with you, I wouldn't
And how'm I doing?
Just Okay...
...Naw. Made that up.
Who do you work for?
Is that Ryuji?
No. Ryuji just hires us.
Hires you for what?
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
And you, what do you like?
That depends...
Why'd you run off?
They left. I had to go with them.
Why didn't you tell me?
You seemed interesting.
Who else is interested in me?
What do you mean?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
They kidded me a little.
There's not much to tell.
Why did they leave?
Sometimes. I told you I did.
No.
Who did?
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
Food doesn't agree with me.
I'm leaving too.
Why?
I'm sorry. What will you do?
He must be a good friend.
We're very close.
What'd he steal?
A chip. Goes in a computer.
One chip?
How do you know you can trust me?
Got to trust someone.
What is it?
Hiroshima.
Get your things.
Oh sure.
Ryuji and Gruner.
Beats me.
Then where's the chip.
Get us one.
What?
Oh.
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
I know the territory.
You coming along?
This going to work?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
Can you?
Sure I can, can't I?
I can't fly it.
What'd...you forget?
They asked about you.
What did you tell them?
That I really don't know.
Now what?
It was my choice.
For you.
What?
I've never met anyone like you.
I'll come back for you.
Aren't you a little optimistic?
Her?
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
I knew it. I told him.
Now what?
We just don't stop.
Do something!
It wasn't me. It was him.
It was you.
He told me what to do.
But you did it. It was you.
That's twenty feet high.
We're not moving fast enough for him.
Yeah...I have to get away.
I know a nice island.
It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
Why are you on to him?
A drink...
You can't take that.
Why not?
The experiment. The danger...
It is?
Just one. The back up.
Could I have it, please.
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Tear it apart?
Yes.
Ahhh...Okay?!!!
Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
Thank you.
Yes.
The other working.
Perfectly.
It'l be alright.
It will.
It doesn't hurt.
No?
Poor bastard.
What does he know?
Too much.
Whoever took it does.
So we better get started.
What about Al...
Hi, Daddy.
What's new?
Yeah? What for?
She was playing with the Pooh doll.
Instant rice...?
What's that outside, Daddy?
Where?
In the backyard.
That remote control thing?
Yeah.
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
Mom.
Yes, baby?
Three hours.
You got a deal. 
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
Sure. Where?
Monday.
Push it.
What? Forget it.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
Yeah. Catch you later.
What do you mean, what's it do?
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
Get me Wigand.
Sure.
...fuck is this? Fuck!
Maybe later.
How about you?
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
Oh, I love that stuff.
Then what are you going to do?
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
I'm afraid you are.
No, I'm not...
Yes, I'm afraid I did.
What caliber is your gun?
What caliber is my gun?
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
Hey, Lowell.
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Catch ya' later.
No, no, we're fine...
Are you sure?
"Mike?"
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
How are you, Jim?
Catch you later.
Jim, it's Lowell.
Yeah?
Don't you have to be at the office?
Yes, it's on the stove...
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
What do you need at the store?
Right now?
That's my stuff from the office...
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
I didn't want to leave it there...
Thomas Sandefur...
Where should I wash them?
What's the difference...
Who's calling?
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
Did you say Berman?
Yeah.
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
Let me call you back...
Hello? Yeah...
..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
What?!
What are you and Mike going to do?
I'm alone on this...
Oh, baby...
Jeffrey...
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
I got perspective.
No, you do not.
...you fucked me!
Alright?
Okay. Thank you.
Yeah.
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
No shit.
What's this?
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
Who are these people?
What?
I'm with Don on this.
I disappeared on you?
Alright. What did you think?
I think it was a disgrace.
Give me a break!
How have you liked your stay?
What I've seen... I've liked.
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
Far as you go where?
If you want to do it.
What are you talking about? Where are you?
Jump in, quick, c'mon...
This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
You okay?
It's obvious, isn't it?
Tempura...
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
No.
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
Jeff...
I'll call them, Lowell.
I heard.
Did you have a good day?
Yeah, great.
No. I mean since whenever...
No? No, what?
ABC...?
That's bullshit, Jeff!
You greased the rails!
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
Yeah. Yeah, I will.
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
He doesn't seem to be listening...
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
There is -- there is no family.
Liane has filed for divorce...
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
It acts as a drug on the body?
Object to the form!
It acts as a...
Object!
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
Howard!
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
Excuse me?
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
Mr. Dumbarton.
No...
Who's the pigeon?
Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
Grounds?
Uh... poetry recitation.
We rest, Your Honor.
Mr. Massey?
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
I don't need it.
You want Botox?
What the hell is Botox?
No frown lines.  New watch?
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
Set one side for Bel Air.
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
Thanks, buddy.
Is she Asian?
Asian? No.
Well... I'm still...
You have the pre-nup?
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
I already made my move, Kenneth.
What?
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
Yes?
What do you mean, was.
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
Ruth Rabino.
You like kids.
It's about time.
Oh boy. If he only knew.
Yeah. I guess. You know --
I'll be right back.
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
Isn't everything?
Did you see the tape?
Not yet.
How do you know?
Why would you be here?
I told you. I was hungry.
You don't believe in it.
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
You just haven't met the right person.
No. I haven't. Have you?
And you've always loved him?
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
He's passionate.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
So I hear. Is that all?
No, that's not all.
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
Miles?
Yes? Marylin?
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
Okay Miles.
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.
Me. Yes.
Oh. And that is -- mom?
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
She didn't love you?
Apparently she was very disappointed.
Boy. Boy, oh boy.
Your mother was.
Oh right. You met Patricia.
No, we're not!
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
I want... I want to...
Yes, Miles. I accept.
You do?
I know.
I have a watch.
Fabric and fringe.
Hello Marylin.
I have a surprise for you.
I bet.
What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
What do you want?
I want to nail you ass.
What kind of "stuff?"
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
That's marriage.
Marylin?
No buts. Now. Out.
I fell in love Miles.
You do? You do love me?
Marylin!
Now. But first, he worked for you.
You were going to have this thug...?
I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
Hello Miles.
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Forgery? Fraud?
Income tax evasion?
Murder?
Murder!
I thought so.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
We are. And it's winding down.
Marylin.
My whole metabolism is -- off.
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
Please!
You used his credit card.
He was right, wasn't he?
So. Now what?
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
Of Massey Myerson?
Do you know him?
Oh, God!
I'm dying.
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
I want to be exposed.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
But you're going through with it?
Well, that's about to change big time.
I guess.
Yes?
When you have a moment.
She's here now.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
We've outlined a settlement...
Rex, please.
Now Rex.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
But then... But then...
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
She always looked out for me.
And she had private investigators assisting her.
She brought my digestive enzymes.
In anticipation of making you sick.
Maybe I should reconsider my...
And she has...?
Video.
What the fuck...?
Sorry.
I am very sorry.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
No. You're not.
Berry spoons.
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
What...?
I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer?
Miles.
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
The Judge is here. Over here, Judge Munson.
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.
Who's Rex's guy?
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
Yes, sir?
Whyuhshe's all right, sir.
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Oh, no, sir. No different than
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Yeah.
Come in. Sit down.
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
The reward.
Who said anything about a reward!
We'll go into that some other time.
Yes!  But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.
Why don't you put me in chains?
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not.  Yes?
South America.
South America!
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
You talk as if he were a gigoloor something.
Ah! Coconut layer cake. Nice and gooey, too. Just the way I like it.
Oh, hello, Dad.
I knocked several times.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
Oh, yes. I heard.
Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too.
Who is he?
Well, if it's as serious as all thatwe'll move heaven and earth to
Oh, come now
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why
Why? Do you know him? 
Oh, nono.
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
Oh, please, Dad
Are you going to see him?
I suppose so.
Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.
She hasn't had a thing yesterdayor today.
Been sending her meals in regularly?
Yessir. She refuses them all.
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
Lower the boats!
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that
Yes, of course.
I haven't the slightest idea.
They're practically all the same, sir. 
But the lady says
I was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me. She was ashamed, I guess.
. . . turn."
Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
You win!
Maybe they doand maybe they don't.
Are you talking to me?
Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.
Wellof all thewell  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
Why, noI  Yes . . . I guess I will.
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
No, thank you.  Thank you so much.
I found it on the seat.
That's right. You didn't.
No. It'd be useless. Father'd get the wire before they would.
You're on a budget from now on.
Shut up!
Yeah. Come onwe're stopping here for the night.
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
You're not really serious about this, are you?
Not at all. 
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
The pleasure is all mine.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
Like what?
Like this. I have no robe.
Heretake mine.
Heyyou're little, aren't you?
Where is the shower?
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
Must be the Spring.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
KingKing Westley was in it.
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Well, you were!
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story?
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
You always want to run everything.
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
It takes money to buy food.
You didn't give that boy all your money?
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
Yeah.
I'm following you.
Aren't you afraid of me?
No.
Okay. Hang on to these.
Of course it is.
You're crazy.
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
You're prejudiced.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
What?
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you!
Well, take them off.
What!
Oh, Peter 
What's got into you?
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
Here. Eat your head off.
I don't want it now.
Thought you were hungry!
wasbut
But what!
Holy Jumping Catfish! You can drive a guy crazy.
What?
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Hayin my teeth.
Raw?
Uh-huh. Want one?
You think it's simple, huh?
Oh, no!
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
Mind your own business.
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
Eat a carrot.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him
If you do, I'll break your neck.
Come onget in.
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on
Come on! come on! 
What happened?
A black eye. 
I love you.
You're forgetting you're married.
You bet I did.
Congratulations.
Same to you.
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
sixseveneightnine
I'm out! I'm out!
Whome?  Want to see me?
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Yep! The Walls of Jericho. 
Won't I ever see you again?
Left twenty minutes ago.
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Sorry, Miss.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
In about fifteen minutes.
Thank you.
Isn't he here?
Why, he'll be back.
Ain't gonna wait a minute.
That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
Eight o'clock.
Just your imagination.
What's 'at?
I said, the old man's screwy!
Bridge washed outaround Dawson.
Up yonder. See the lights?
Yeah.
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Thanks.
Yes.
Wait a minute, GordonI
Get out!
Don't "Joe" me.
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
Well, I got it, Joe.
Who's she gonna marry?
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
I am, Joe.
You!
Okay, pete. 
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
What?
I ain't got a hat.
Yeah.
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
Collect?
Collect.
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Yeah, you'll have to git .
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Zeke.  Git!
Yes, Ma.
What's the idea?
Yeah. Come oncome on!
Five G'sor I crab the works.
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
I can use a smart guy like you.
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
Orange, New Jersey.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Yeah. Just babies.
You love them, don't you?
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
No!... Shaw!  Director of The Trade Mart?  This is incredible.
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
Keep saying what?
You're not digging.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
Who gives a shit what he calls himself?
Yeah, strange guy.  Dave introduced him as...
The anonymous kind, Chief.
That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
Where you going, boss?
I don't know, Bill, I just don't know.
Why?
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
...ever called Dean Andrews?
No, I did not.
No, I did not.
Thank you... Mr. Shaw.
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
You still questioning any Cubans?
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
It leads farther than that.
That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
No, I never saw him before in my life.
What was so appealing about Houston?
And then Sunday?
I believe the boys got a couple.
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Would you say this "Leon" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?
Yeah, yeah.  But leave me alone for awhile.  I got to make some calls.
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
Hi, Freckle Face.
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
Four to six.
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
I know.
A Perry Russo?
A Willie O'Keefe?
David Ferrie.
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job.
Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!
I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
Tough day.
My sympathies.
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
Huh?
Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw too much stuff like this in the war.
Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who would be running that training?
Take a look across the street.
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
And he never hit you before?
Never touched me.
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
If you buy what you read in the paper.
Was he there often?
And Oswald?
Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
The assassination, Jack?
You're so naive, mister.
I just don't want to do it.  What else?
Splendid, love to see them.
Germany.
How many men are working with you on this?
Virginia or Elizabeth?
Virginia.
Do you walk home?
Uh huh.
Thanks.
But then you told her you were home.
Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
Yes, Max, I understand.
I'll call her.
Won't forget?
I won't forget.
Who?
You.
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
How old is that machine gun shit?
I need a favor.
That requires me goin' out tonight?
A bit.
Go ahead.
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
I can't believe you do me this way.
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
In his inside coat pocket.
I found out.
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
Hey, Jackie.
She wants to make a deal.
What's she want?
She wants to go back to work.
What's she willing to give us?
What's in it?
Beauty products.
That's my diet shit.
Thanks.
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
Can you do it or not?
Fine.
What's her name?
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
Who do you think I am?
You're serious?
In cash.
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
I don't think so.
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
I'd love one, but not there.
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
It's kind of a sports bar
That doesn't sound dark.
Why does it need to be dark?
I am, as a matter of fact.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
Same as you. Ten thousand.
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
No, you didn't. What branch?
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
It was the other guy who busted me.
He's got that kinda money?
I am. Have a seat.
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
You went out this morning and bought a gun.
Yeah.
Sure.
Uh-huh.
Who is this?
The Delfonics.
'76?
'74, I think.
It's nice.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
He told me last night.
He called you?
He came by.
What?... What'd you do?
We talked.
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
You're not old. You look great.
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
Bigger?
Yeah.
Surprise.
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
What'd ya see?
"American President"
How was it?
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
For now. These relationships never last too long.
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
She's adorable. But I had to end it.
How old's Annette?
I don't care.
You talk them into it?
Bring the money in and they follow it?
Right around here, in the food court.
Sit down, leave the bag under the table?
Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
The day you got me out of jail?
That's my job.
Did you do it that night?
More or less.
Do you think they bought it?
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
In the bag underneath.
What if he checks it?
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Set him up.
Uh-huh.
Tell him I want to give him his money.
Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?
I hesitated taking that much.
I told him I might.
I never lied to you.
I know.
We're partners.
Spain.
Madrid or Barcelona?
Sure I can't twist your arm?
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
I thought you were tired of your business?
I'm just tired in general.
Are you scared of me?
I beg your pardon?
What if I plead guilty?
And cooperate? You might get probation.
If I don't cooperate?
Not every day?
Then you don't see him for a few days?
He say is a surprise.
Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.
Yeah?
What the fuck is that shit?
I know what it looks like.
You planted that shit on me.
Can I smoke?
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
If I'm working, I can help you.
You ever see him sell guns?
Not really.
I imagine shit needs to be done.
We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.
Who's the other one?
What did you say?
Uh-huh.
Was she there?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Uh-huh.
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
You didn't count it?
I never have. It's not my money.
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
That would be one point of view.
I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
Not in the fitting room.
You'd take a polygraph on it?
If it'll make you happy.
I sure hope you haven't done anything dumb Jackie.
What about you?
Buy ya a beer?
I'm waiting for the phone.
Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway.
Great...  ...Wanda!
Gimme one anyway.
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
What were you two fighting about?
That coke was yours, wasn't it?
You already knew that?
Kinda.
What's that fucker ever done for us?
I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
Hi, Melanie.
Are you getting that black suit?
Yeah, do you like it?
It looks good on you.
Do you got something for me?
You betcha.
I was expecting you. Come in.
Got some o.j.?
Yeah.
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
I knew it.
I didn't tell 'em anything.
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
You thought right... Now take your hands from around my throat, nigga.
Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
I understand woman, damn!
Go sit over in that chair.
All your money's in Mexico.
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
I told them.
They already know it's you.
It's true, isn't it?
If you want.
Yeah, I think a woman.
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
So we need two people, two women.
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
Plus the same deal as before.
I can do that.
Who?
What'd you care?
I was there, I saw her do it.
Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
She don't know shit about the money.
What does she think she's gettin?
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
I can sit through it once.
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
Sure.
Four days ago.
Where at?
Susanville.
How long?
Two months shy of four years.
Four years?
Uh-huh.
What for?
Bank robbery.
Really, I'm impressed.
Yeah, there's another hit left.
What's a Metrix?
The roller disco one.
Fourteen.
Yeah.
I thought you were sixteen.
Where were you?
Detroit.
With Ordell?
We had done time together already.
No.
C'mon, don't lie.
I don't like dancing.
Did you ever go I one?
You been to Japan?
I lived there for about nine months.
You lived in Japan, when?
About five years ago.
Who's arm is that?
Must of made quite an impression.
Sure.
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
Yeah.
So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?
Does that bother you?
You live with him.
...and just take it from him.
All right already.
Are you sweating?
Fuck you. I can carry it.
Yeah, down the end.
You sure?
You sure?
Who's your partner?
As low as two.
Are you serious?
Which one is for the car?
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
Whatcha watchin'?
I dunno.
Uh-huh.
C'mon in.
That was Beaumont.
Who was Beaumont?
But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.
Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
What's your relationship?
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
I told you, man.  She my fine little surfer gal.
Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
Twice. In the parking lot.
You know how she is.
You couldn't just hit her?
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
You shot her twice?
So you're sure she's dead.
Pretty sure.
Where did you shoot her?
What?
Where's the rest of it?
How much it there?
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
You said five hundred and fifty!
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
We went to the parking lot.
Where you shot her.
That's right.
Pull the car over.
It's in there.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
What?
Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
They don't have your winning personality.
Where would you like me to put my ash?
He's a big one. You two tight?
You have it with you?
Beaumont. That's the only name I know.
Livingston, huh?
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
House.
Yes.
I got some more business for ya.
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
What?
You didn't hear?
Hear what?
What does she do for you?
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
Is that what I think it is?
You keep fuckin' with me, you're gonna be asleep forever.
Git your ass in here.
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
Winston found you.
How the fuck did he find me?
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
Well, give it to me then.
All I did was walk out with it.
And you did that to protect my interest?
In a way, yes.
She's been there since Thursday night.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
That I gotta see.
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
Call her, tell her the combination.
I know where it is.
Turn left.
I know where to turn.
Uh-huh.
You sure?
You know it's for you.
It's Beaumont.
'Ola!
Let me speak to Max Cherry.
He's around.
I'll give you his beeper.
Where do you want to go?
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
I'm alive.
Then what are you doing here?
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
Let me out of here!
No! Oh God.
It's fun.
What do you want?
Just to see you. That's all.
Well, how do I look?
Like Della.
Are you all right?
I'm okay.
Oh God!
You're hurting me!
Stop!!!!
Daddy. Let go.
What do you want from me?
LET GO!
I could have told you that.
Short? It's ended.
Oh, terrific.
Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
Well, try, huh.
What do you mean?
Maybe there's a larger truth.
What are you talking about?
Maybe the demons are real.
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
Hey, wait!
Don't bother to call again, okay?
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
There was a bang.
It was the window.
Tell your mother.
Mom, it's ...
Now what?
Don't go.
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
Why do you say that?
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
That was set. I'm tellin' you.
He told me he was going to Hell.
A couple of weeks, I think.
No. Not really ...
Shit!
An explosion, just like Paul's.
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
I say you should get a shrink.
How do you know?
What can I tell you?
I saw Sarah the other day.
Her knee acting up?
A bit.
What did she have to say?
She talk about the boys?
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
You should go back to her.
Wiggle your toes.
I know.
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
I've seen it. It's all pain.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
Jake, you need to rest.
Likewise.
I haven't seen her in months.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
Well, try not to get burned. You have a great mind, Jacob. Don't let anyone tempt you away from it.
No.  I see them.
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
I need your insight, your intuition.
New? He's been here for years.
Jacob Singer.
I'm not cold.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
Save me!
Who did?
Why didn't you turn on the light?
I didn't want to wake you.
Gee, thanks a lot.
Where is the lamp?
Where are you?
Where to?
Thanks.
What do you mean?
The room!
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
Don't ask.
No. Have you seen my glasses?
Where'd you leave 'em?
I don't know.
Did you look around the headboard?
Jezzie, I can't see.
Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
Your kid dropped it off.
Who? Jed?
No. The little one.
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
They're weird names.
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
A good lay.
And look what I got.
The best.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
What do you mean you can see?
Look at her face. A real bitch.
Not to me.
Well, you didn't marry her.
I just want to look ...
How's it going?
'Cause she's always on your mind.
When was the last time I said a word?
It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
Come on. What were they, Jake?
Oh, come on. It's early.
Where are we?
We're at Della's.
Where?
Where's Della? Bring her here?
Show me Della!
Hey, I'm here.
If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
It's gone to the top.
How high is that?
The numbers stop at 107.
Get your clothes off.
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
Get your clothes off!
Coming here?
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
What kind of man are you?
Lie down!
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Hey, I'm not dressed.
Here. I'll do it.
With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
I know.
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
While you were in the shower.
Why didn't you call me?
He said you didn't have one.
What's he talking about?
Jezzie?
Who else were you expecting?
Let go!
I want to know. You tell me!
It might be for me.
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
What's gotten into you?
I can waitress. I'm good.
Please.
I love you when you're angry.
Where are they?
Sit down.
Where have they gone?
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
I don't know you.
You've lived with me for two years.
You know goddamn well what I mean.
I'm not upset.
Jake, what is it?
I'm tired.
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
Then don't bug me.
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
West.
Where's West? New Jersey?
Don't be funny.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
Sit down, Jake.
Where are they?
Sit down!
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Where have they gone?
Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
You know who I am.
Observation, mainly. Clinical study. You were one of the survivors.
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
Who then?
Sometimes. When it's convenient.
Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.
It's strong stuff.
Pleasant dreams.
Just relax.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
Better living through chemistry, that's my motto.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
Save the words ... Just send back my credit card.
Yeah, you and everyone else.
I know. That's why I'm asking.
Hot. Where do I sign?
You got a nice tan, though.
Help me!
Please come quietly.
We're not going to hurt you.
What?!
Total delirium.
He'll never make it.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Call my chiropractor.
We're doing everything we can.
Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
Lennox Hospital.
I'm awake?
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
That's a lie. My family was here.
Of course it is. What else could it be?
Jacob Singer?
Speaking.
Paul Gruneger!
Paul Gruneger! Well I'll be goddamned!
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
Nope.
I just need to talk.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
I don't know.
You in trouble?
Yeah.
They're waitin' for me, that's why.
I don't know what to do.
Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
I've seen them too ... the demons!
You've seen them?
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
A car accident.
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
How did it happen?
No one knows. They say it blew up.
Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
Bring it in.
Is he all right?
On top of him?
Okay. My husband's got two more bags. He's coming. They're heavy.
Punk?
Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
Oh, come on!
Alright, asshole.
What do you mean, not enough time?
We don't have time to argue!
Could you show a little compassion?!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
No.
We don't have a choice!
What?
I don't know. Nothing.
We made it?
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
What?!
Kkinsa! Open the doors!
Thorgan, pull us in.
He....He...
He came for me, I had to run!
Cool.
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
Where'd you get the gun?
I think I broke my arm.
The hull's imploding!
Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
What are you gonna do, tell me?
They're back here.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Let's move out!
Thorgan, suit up.
Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
We could convert fission transistors.
Bring 'em all. Let's move!
Then stop talking and work faster!
I don't know!
And now we're all out of it.
Suit up.
Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
You're a teacher.
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
My job.
Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
You just keep an eye out.
Yeah yeah. Got it.
What?
Where is he?
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
Oh man, what the hell happened?
Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
Negative.
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Give me a break! What happened?
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down.
I'm pulling, damnit!
We have to get off this ship.
No you don't!
I guessed.
And what happend to ...?
Not so bad.
Oh sure, all the time.
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
Okay, good tip.
You'll be fine.
You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember?
I think I had some when I was eight.
I think so, why?
I know you.
I'm stuck!
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
She broke my fucking nose!
She needs a little time.
More time...shit, she's had 400 years...
Oh I like her a lot.
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
We're screwed.
He's right behind us!
Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
Again?! Jesus!
Well, do something!
Close the fucking door!
NO!
GO, GO, GO!
Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
Just get us to the ship!
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
That ought'a help the situation.
Let's just get out of here.
So what else is new?
A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
You're leaving me here alone?
Later.
You prefer an apple?
Oh my God! Adrienne?
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Crutch?
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
Kay-em 14.
Barbie from hell...
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
Oh shit! There he is!
Come here, might as well fix that arm.
Ow!
Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
Who are you apologizing to?
Good point.
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
I missed you too.
I love you.
We're missing two of the kids!
This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
Defense droids. I'm on it.
No! He's coming with us!
Ssh.
I just know.
Keep trying!
Then open the doors!
Thirty seconds.
I gotta go back.
But?!!
We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
See you then . . . doctor.
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
30? How long was I out?
That's right, now if you could...
You wanna die?
Are we locked down?
They can deal with this sort of thing.
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
4You're not going anywhere.
Three...two...one...
Hockey player? He's not a ...
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
What have I done?! Idiots.
Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
Sure but what good will that do?
It's okay.
My boat's neat, dad!
I want him out of the ocean.
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
Just a favor for your old man.
Here --  Take him home.
What?
You got it.
Try some of this. I made it myself.
I know who he is...
He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
It's my charter. My party.
Nobody. We're drifting with the current.
Don't tell me my business!  Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
C'mon. Middle appendix --
I almost had 'im.
Tattoo. Had it taken off.
The bilge pumps. There --
Shut up! Just pump her out!
Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call.
No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
Full throttle! To port!
Do you see the kids?
Probably out in the back yard.
Give me 30 years, I'll get it.
Feed the dogs.
Don't be silly - You're going to make summer better for them...
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water...
Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
Where is he?
He's sitting in it.
Michael! Come inside!
Thank you.
No. Home here.
You going to be all right?
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
What'll I tell the kids?
Tell 'em I went fishin'!
I didn't agree to that!
What kind of a shark did you say it was?
Why?
Just sign it, Larry.
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the Oceanographic Institute. 
Swell.
Let's all have a drink.
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
Our friend, the shark.
Florida license plate.
He ate a car?
It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
I wish it would rain...
This is quite a place.
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
It's a whale out there.
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
Think the tide's with us?
Just keep kicking.
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
I can't imagine why.
You picked her up on the ferry.
I didn't know her.
And nobody else saw her in the water?
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
Think she might've run out on you?
Some friends and me took a house.
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
We never had any. What's the problem?
Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer.
What else could've done that?
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind three nibbles back.
Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
We're blowin' half the bounty on bait --
Is anyone having this...?
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
Is that a boat?
This is Quint, Missus.
Well... is everything all right?
I've got all these signs here...
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
Let me see your hands...
Down here, Hooper!
Fasten the pole.
25 feet. And three tons of him there.
Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.
Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
And I'll drink to yours.
The shaft is giving.
No way! He can't!
He's under!
I don't have it.
I don't think so.
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
You know how I feel about her.
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
I just hope you don't consider her a close friend.
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
I don't know...
I'm pregnant.
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
But you copy my work every week.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
I'll try to drop by later.
Well, I do.
Were we together?
I totally heard you did.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
What?
I still have your virginity!
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
Huh?
Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
Why?
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
What, you mean as friends?
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Okay.
Oh, hey Vijay.
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
Did you hear it's yours?
Yup.
What a trip, man.
I don't really know anything about it.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
What is your job title, exactly?
Excuse me?
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
Hon, did you get expelled?
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
I know enough.
Oh, go fly a kite.
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
Geeeerta Rauuuss!
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
Sorry. I was just getting something.
I did steal a squirt of perfume. What do you think? It's Clinique Happy.
Blood and guts.
We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
I rock a Harmony.
Oh.
Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
Yeah.
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
No, more commercial stuff.
Like what?
Commercials.
Oh.
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.
No, he's the dad.
You know... it's parts...
I know what junk is.
Yeah?
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
Yeah, I definitely need to make you some CDs. At least while my kid is hanging out in there.
Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
Uh, thanks.
Why? What the big deal?
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
Is Vanessa here?
Nope. We're safe.
You're gonna like this, I promise.
I actually know this one.
You do?
You've never been to a dance, have you?
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
What are you?
What?
No?
No thanks. I'm off pills.
Well, it was nice seeing you.
Sure.
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
Oh really?
Then what's going on?
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Wow! It's magical.
Nothing.
Your name, please?
Juno MacGuff.
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
Thundercats are go!
I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
Is this Juno?
Only the one in my pants.
Dude, I'm pregnant.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
Share the love, Tits!
What?
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
You sound shocked or something.
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
Well, you are kind of... convex.
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
A Pilates machine?
What do you make with that?
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
Are you looking for any other compensation?
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
I want to be a mommy so badly!
Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
Can you see it?
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
Don't mock me.
Looks like it, yeah.
Have you found a place to stay?
A hotel?
It's a loft.
Aren't you the cool guy?
I suppose anything's possible.
Carrie.
...Thank you.
...Yeah.
Is it hard to learn?
Not really.
So you don't do any of those things.
He whips you?
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
It's a portfolio of my work.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
Took 'em all.
No it is not!
Hold still.
Adele... are you serious?
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
Carryin' a gun.
...Anything else?
What?
That's not true!
Early, you are so sweet.
Almost.
I heard that.
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
As many times as it takes.
I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.
Early! Stop!!
Walter Livesy.
I don't know. Wish I did.
Vernon, Florida.
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
Turkey mostly.
What do you need a Bible for?
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
How much do I owe you?
Forget it.
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
This guy killed a mess of people.
Henry Lucas.
...Then some.
Now why is that?
You wanna hear mine?
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
Nah... how much money have you got?
If you say so.
Damn right I do.
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
Thanks. What are you doing?
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
We don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out.
Up yours.
I heard that.
Fuck!
Take your time.
Look again!
I'm finished.
Why, what did he do?
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
Not yet.
Nervous?
Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
Where's Adele?
She wasn't feeling so good.
No, thanks, I can manage.
...Brian hurt his foot.
No, never. Excuse me.
Shut your mouth.
Everybody just shut up!
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
...Janitor's job.
Who are you?
His Parole Officer.
Where would we find him?
No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
...That'd be my guess.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
Yes. Altogether.
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
With how many people?
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
Were they wearing condoms?
Was up bitch?
You fucked it?
Did what take?
How long did you fuck her?
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
What?
You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
Like. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin seduction guys.
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
Are you hungry?
What for? That guys a dick.
Probably.
He lives on 76th?
78th.
Den less go Joe.
Yeah.
Did she suck your dick?
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
You got any money?
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
You down with the boost?
Unzip my pack, yo.
Who?
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
Oh. You like her?
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
Why I do what?
That.
Why I give pennies?
Yeah. Why you give money.
Shut the fuck up.
I don't know. How much do you want?
Fifteen for me.
You are?
Nothen' B.
Where you goin' tonight?
You goin'?
Yeah.
You sure?
Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
Right now?
Yeah. Come on.
Hold on.
Is it cold?
Yeah.
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Come on. You can rave on another night.
Yes.
Trust me. Don't be nervous.
But I'm scared Telly.
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Bang up stuff.
Here. Swallow.
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
What things? I'm telling you, nothing's going to change.  I want to make you happy. That's all.
Of course I do.
What?
Come dance.
Telly is at Steven's. There's a bunch of people over there. Come on dance.
I guess so.
15.
I'm sorry.
You're OK?
Yeah.
Everything is wrong.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Am I getting warm?
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
You are being ripped open.
Did you bleed?
I didn't bleed.
You didn't?
No, I didn't bleed.
Boom!!! Boom!!!
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know.
Good luck.
I only did it once and...
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
I gotta find him.
I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
Making love is like.
Sweet.
It's like...
It's really slow. It's slow boring.
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
You've heard the stories right?
No.
Oh god. That's horrible.
Holy shit. That's all true?
No. I was just kidding.
What?!
Shh.
When are you gonna be back?
Not too late.
Four-thirty in the morning?
Not too late.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
It's me. Telly.
Hello?
Paul it's Telly. Open up.
I don't know, eight or nine.
Where does everyone sleep?
It's grandmother style.
It's very monotonous.
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
Yes.
What kind of problem?
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
You are!  I don't like you.
Fine, don't ask me out on a date.
You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
What?
You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
The door was open.
No it wasn't.
You ever do any hunting, Peter?
No, I need the original note.
There's a photostat of the original on the wall.
Then what's he talking about?
Homesearchers.
You're a lying bastard!
Get off me!
Sit down!
It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.
What was your relationship with her?
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
Anything?
It's a voice modulator.
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
Did anyone stand out?
What do you mean, stand out?
But a hundred men could move him.
He was with me?
Who is this?
Just a second.  Hello?
To get your attention.
Did you know her?
No, only the path she chose to travel.
You'll find her.
Not really.
Why her?
Because she's the type.
But you said you didn't know her.
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
Pain?  Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have.
So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time.
Very good.
The police haven't told you?
You sonofabitch!
The game's over.  You lost.
It's me you want.  Not her.
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
The pipes.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Never mind.  He died two years ago.
New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
Fuck off!
I just can't believe it.
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
He already did once.
Why did he what?
He was watching you.
Uh huh.
I'm Kathy.
Of course.
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
No... but I can tell.  A woman knows these things.
Nice meeting you.
My cheering section.
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
That has nothing to do with it.
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
Nothing.
For what?
I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.
But you promised.
Who's Kathy?
Six, eight hours tops.
Any sign of rape?
You mean, no prints but hers?
Yeah.
How long she been dead?
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
What do you think he did?
It's important.
Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
This ain't no photo.
Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
That's a big area to cover.
You don't have a shred of evidence!
Okay.  Why don't you go out there. We'll check in with you later.
Through a rental agency.
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
That's alright.  We'll take it from here.
"Is".  Did you tell him about the institute?
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
He uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  Singular.  Not can't move us.
Are we going to go through this again?
I went out.
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
I signed the confession.  What about the car?
Then I'll transpose.
Just thought you might want to talk.
Whatever's on your mind.
Who says something's on my mind.
Mate in five.
Exactly... and you did this.
Feel like practicing?
Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
We'll call you back.
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
"Carefully".  "Carefully". "Carefully".
It's alright.
Uh huh.
It seems like such a complicated game.
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
Do you always open quickly?
Are we talking about me, or chess?
Getting too hot in here for you?
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
She could be dead after the game.
I don't think I could.
It wasn't intentional.
Another kind of game?
In a way.
This isn't a game.
Let's change the subject.
That's not fair!
Why?
Because I work with them.
You're not?
How could you?  Unless you were there.
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
Doesn't that scare you?
No.
Why?
Because I think he's wrong.
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
I'm sure you are.
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
Wasn't I just talking about me?
No.  You were talking about chess.
Alright.  What about me?
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
She died in a car accident.
I'm sorry.
It must've been very hard on Erica?
Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
What is this?
Then show me who you are.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
Call room service.
Would you settle for pepperoni?
The line was busy.  I'll try again.
I thought you said the line was busy?
I tried again and got through.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Exactly.  It's the key.
Where's the note?
Can I come in?
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
Why?
Because she killed herself!!
Why not?
Because I know what it says.
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
No he didn't.
He didn't tell you either.
Are you going to come tonight?
Yeah.  I'll be there later.
I got lucky.
I'm not nervous.
Well, then this time you'll have to stay for the whole match, won't you?
I don't have to go through with it either.
Well, you're beautiful.
I have no intention of getting used to it.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
Never mind my ears! Go away!
About what?
I can't wait either.
Colwyn.
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
Colwyn ...
Where is the Fortress?
I will find you. I will be with you.
Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn.
All the passages are guarded.
You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
All directions are the same here.
That way. I can feel the cold.
Of course it was.
I won't leave you here.
Does the Queen live?
The new Queen lives.
Turold's son was to marry her.
But there is another entrance to this place.
Reach out farther. Call to her.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
What do you see?
Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.  Wait.
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
I'm not sure.
But you suspect.
You will know, in good time.
He has come for Lyssa.
Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
Where the spiral begins.
She can see the Beast!
Use your sword.
No! You cannot know that!
I can. Because I choose it.
I forbid you!
We must enter the swamp.
What will happen?
You have done it?
Yes. It is today.
Each to his fate.
Even by you?
I ache with it.
I cannot take comfort when she has none.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
I cannot.
Staying alive.
He saved our lives.
I have need of friends.
How did you know I had sons?
I know you.
To the place where Death lives.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
That I promise you.
I'm all right.
Not sleepy, either?
No.
We must try to get horses.
A flicker of talent.
Yes, my lord.
Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
Would you settle for a boar?
We'll meet you at the inn.
Can't I come, too?
No.
And mine goes with you.
Sugarballs?
No.
You do?
You can have half.
Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
I only want one.
A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
No, no. I'm with you, boy.
You had better manners as a pig.
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
And do you think I live on air?
We have plenty of hares.
Food for crows.
Oh, my poor stomach.
Look at its insides.
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
No. He will master the leader.
Then he will die!
He will not come. You will be my queen.
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
That I am, my lady.
A match for your son, I think.
Yes. We lost five.
You were lucky. I lost thirty there.
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
With an old voice?
You know the voice.
I will seek the Fortress for you.
Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.
There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
Yes.
She has the power to kill.
She had another name once.
Fewer will survive them.
It is not necessary. They will not follow.
Ynyr!
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
No, she was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?
We had no children.
You had a son.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
It is no trickery.
Those are reflections.  <u>This</u> is my face!
Yes.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
Why do you want to know?
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
...Office 2702.
...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
...Good...  But what's special in him?
Yeah.
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Well, I don't need them...
Good.
130... 140...
Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
Whoever.
Now, try a running guy.
OK.
You were scared, weren't you?
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
Yes.
No, you can't go out.
Why?
Too heavy.
Mathilda, stop, please!
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
...OK.  I love you anyway.
Mathilda?!
I think.
A little...
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!
Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
...Don't you like me?
...I don't know.
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Three times, then two times.
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
I have no fear.
Fine...
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
Huh, that's good!
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
...No... he's my lover...
Huh? Why?
Ten dollars... A month.
Huh... Yeah, yeah... Of course.
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
No... Dino's.
Salute.
Where?
Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
Why am I such an authority?
Here comes the resume.
I don't accept that.
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
I'll make it.
Maybe later.
I won't let you die.
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
You need a ride, Preacher?
Pardon?
I've seen it before.
You have?
No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
The flowers... they're beautiful.
There was no card.
It's just a regular day.
What?
The new store?
We can do it together.
I don't follow.
Then why?
There's no reason.
I will -- I promise.
You like to take walks?
I've changed my mind.
You can't change your mind.
You've just decided, is that right?
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
He's plastered.
That's okay -- really it is.
Did you have a dream?
Pacifica, California.
Yes.
Good.
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
Pacifica, California.
From where?
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
I see.
About my love for her.
Not our problem.
Jumped where?
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
Making the grand total?
Perhaps there's another route?
Mammoth.
The Gazette's small huh?
Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
Where?
Tomorrow.
California.
I always knew you had good instincts...  Goodbye Kris.  I'll see you when I get back.
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
Oh, a coastal city.  That's good.
She wasn't certain... I never really showed her.
So I've been informed.
She never ate a slice.
... The Grapes of Wrath.
You're amazing.
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
Saluting.
What, come on?
In a hospital.
Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
I need your help.
Good morning.
Oh, that's not mine.
Hello.
How are you feeling?
What?  Who are you?
This isn't right.
What do you want?
What are my choices?
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
...Noooo.
Orange soda?
No.
Coffee?
No.
Sparkling apple cider?
No.
Water?
Water?
Hello.
Are you working?
No -- S.E.R.A.
No, this is fine. I was just wondering.
You what?
I sometimes fade out.
You were going to get my door.
Of course.
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
OK... whatever.
Yes, that's right.
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
Yeah. And your meter just ran out.
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
You OK out there?
Yes. Take your time. I'm fine.
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
Don't be silly?
Sorry.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
Can we just forget it?
I don't understand any of that.
Can we just ignore it?
Yes... I'll give you that.
Thank you, Sera.
No... we already talked about that.
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
Let's stay for a while.
Yes... I guess I knew that.
I don't know. I'll find out though.
Where are you staying?
Right here at the hotel. Why?
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
I've been all right.
I am lonely, Yuri.
With an old friend.
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
All of it. I need to buy many things... all of it!
It's me, Yuri.
Sera... please go.
That's right.
But it's a top three school --
I have a 4.0.
I can't tell you.
You understand you're on trial for murder?
Go to hell.
I'll take that as a no.
I believe we are.
What?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
He's an ass that's gonna try.
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
That's not what's important.
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
He means well. He's really brilliant and all.
Who could better understand than me?
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
His dead body with a bullet in it.
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
No, she'd stashed it by then.
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
Who's askin'?
I'm Elle Woods. Ms. Bonafante's attorney.
Tell him, Paulette.
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
Thank you!
Is everything okay?
About the alibi --
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
So everything you just said --
I'm a man who knows what I want.
Yes, I am.
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
No, she was crying her eyes out.
What?
See?
How about --
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
Is she as pretty as you?
No.
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
Licensed attorney or family member?
Uh -- family.
Relation?
I'm her sister.
Name?
Delta. Gamma.
You know her?
Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
I'm still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi.
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
I know. He has it sent out.
Yes, you are.
Thank you. I love you, too.
I have the highest GPA in Delta Gamma!
Your scrunchie?
Picking out my wedding dress!
What?!
Josh proposed!
No way --
Not yet.
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out?
Thanks again for your help!
I wasn't gonna --
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
She's completely untrustworthy.
But maybe it's not what you think.
No, she can't move for an hour.
We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --
Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
That's not really a topic that keeps me up at night -- but maybe it should.
Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
For a butt-head? Yes.
What?!
Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.
I'm quitting.
Oh, my God!!
Are you asking me on a date?
Is he the only one?
What do you think?
I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
I just don't understand what went wrong --
What, like on va-kay?
Really --
I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!
Why not?
I don't know --
You should. Do you have a resume?
Maybe she found him like that.
Of course, I do!
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
Uh, no. Maybe you should try the Lido deck.
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
So are you!
Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
You go where?
Harvard. Law school.
You got into Harvard Law?
What, like it's that hard?
Do anything exciting?
Thank you. Having fun?
Now I am.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
I just don't want to see you get your hopes up. You know how you get.
Thank you.
See?
Are you serious?
Huh. Imagine that. Looks like I am.
Where?
And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
And what is your boyfriend's name?
Why do you say that?
Haven't you seen the cabana boy?
Where's the Rock?
It's not a Theta --
Pull up next to him!
Faith.
Anything left for smashing you may happily smash.
I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
Always.
Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
To finish last evening's delightful work.
What do you want with me?
Your love.
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
You're magnificent.
Grotesque... monstrous...
Not from me, surely...
You... you're a beast!
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
Do you feed on mice and rats?
To be my bride, of course.
I'd soon die.
What do you want from me?
At the moment, very little.  Your company at my table...
Yes?
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
It's terrible.
Oh no... Don't you understand?
To be sure.
What!
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
Well spoke.  True to the mark.  And if it's wine you're wanting, it's wine we shall have.
I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
He is afraid of enchantment!  Will you listen to the fool prattle on.
Big question that, lad.  Why what?
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
No less a creature than the Lindfarne Worm.
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
Better we eat him than the other way round.
Something's coming.
It would appear so.
Careful, lad.
Aye!  That too.
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
Whatever for?
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
Something the matter?
Ogg's footprints!
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
Going grows slower... we've not made... half a mile in two hours...
It bodes evil.
Willful creature, that one...
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
Aye, lad... we've little else to go by.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Nay.  This time we strike first!
I know the rogue, Jack.  Tis Jimmy Squarefoot.
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
No... but what choice have we?
The chill is worse this night.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
Why not mine the damned walls?
Been telling you that all along, lad.
What magic have we on our side?
That's it!
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
Fire away!
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
It's what we'll find there worries me.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Mean you to seek him out below?
I'm not afraid of the dark.
Patience, lad.
Hurry up!
He'll not escape me.
You're on your own... like a true champion.
I've not heard a note out of you.
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
Where?
Go on... go on...
No, no, no... this is different!
Gonna make ogre-stew!
Three cheers for our champion.
Very thrifty.  Even got your arrow back.
They've fired the moat!
They'll do nicely.
Sorry.
Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
If you like.
Never.
But you did... you did!
I may have said perhaps...
Liar!
Or perchance...
Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
A gentleman would offer water.
Be patient.
What's the matter?
Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
Shhh!
In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches.
They rival the angels of paradise.
Jack!
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
To fetch your napkin.
My father and the Baron.
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
Its powers are strong.
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
I have no wife.
Then, perchance you'll me.
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
What if I answer yes?  Will my wish come true?
Jack... Forgive me...
Only what's right...
I was bewitched... it's better this way...
They told me you were dead.
You've freed me, Jack...
Sunlight... It destroys him.
Sunlight?
So, he's hiding in the dark...
In the dark... where I join him...
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
And I love you, my husband.
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
Biting you?
Pinching me!
Pinching?  Where?
Everywhere!  Ow!
I can't see a thing.
Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
His feet shall never cross my lips.
Why then, there thou hast.  We be lucky worse has not befallen us.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
Princess?  I know of no princess.
Exceeding fair.
As fair as me?
No!
Dead, dead, dead.
I don't believe you.
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
And charmed, of course.
Do I not please you, Jack?
In every way.
And am I not fair?
Wondrously so.
Jest with me then.
How so?
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
I'm promised to another!
Please...
We wait.
Small miracles better than no miracles...
Up ahead!
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
It's done... we'll never catch him.
You're well equipped, I'd say. Legendary arms...
May God protect you.
I'm sending you back to Hell!
You've been inside?
In a dream.
I'm not cheating!  I'm not looking!
I thought I might stop by.
He's here.  Check the bathroom.
I checked everywhere.  He's not there.
Mom said I should.
Oh.
I would have anyway.
Who are you?
What color?
Red.
Here, honey!
And why was the alarm on?
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
Oh God, we don't want the police!
I couldn't sleep last night.
Uh...using Josh like that.
Who are all these people?
I'll survive.
He seems lonely.
No.
Why?
I'm living here while I build another house.
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
I want you to try something with me, okay?
Let's shut up and not kill her.
What did you think it would be?
I don't know...  More like when I kissed Sam.
What are you doing here?
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
He jumped into the ocean.
You look better without make-up.
I can't even take a shower here.
No.  That's okay.
Turn over.
I'm okay.
I'm coming in.
We're not gonna do anything.
Why are you so stupid?
Why are you so uptight?
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
Josh said...
I'm not gay.
I thought I was helping you.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
Are you afraid of heights?
Not if what he left me was real.
Floating to Catalina.
He's got a standing invitation.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
Will he talk to me?
No.
It could have been a squirt gun.
You've been good this week.
We've known each other since grade school.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
I've been dreading you.
Oh, yes.
An exhaust system or a window is code.
Allowed outside the enclosed area.
If that's what it takes.
Months.
What are you on?
Pardon me?
how much weight have you lost?
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
He buys and sells the world.
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
Maybe...?
That's too long.
How old are you?
Forty.
I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.
I hate this job.
From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
Good.  I was hoping for that.
What can I do for you, George?
Yes, it is.
She's out with a friend.
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
She didn't really say.
Oh...okay.
Uh huh.
I didn't recognize you!
I'm sorry.
I want you both to stay.
Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
You're here early today.
We're getting out of the ground today.
It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
He escaped.  He's going back in.
George, this is the third time.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
And you thought they might be under her dress?
I don't know.
To check up on me?
I'll be around to check up on you.
Why would you be there?
Because I live there.
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
You'll know me by the time we're through.
I'll get your bag.
You don't have a choice.
Mom...please.
I almost saw Catalina.
Goodnight.
I warned you yesterday.
No you don't.
It bugs me.
You'll have money when you work.
You're so predictable.
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
I'm not doing it!
It'll be fine.
Hey...hey!
I don't know.
When are you going to be back?
I don't know.
Well, until you know, you can't go.
Did you got through my pants?
I might have a solution.
The gloves on the table are for you.
You can't make me do a thing.
Sit down for a second.
No.
Hi, Mom.
I know.  Why?
How do you become something you're not?
What would you like to be?
What I'm not.
What are you now?
Nothing.
That's not true.
I know parts of who you are.
What do you know about me?
I'm telling you now.
I gave up on you.
Getting high, I guess.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
I'm proud of you, Sam.
To hide a black eye.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
That's so weird...
What's wrong with your back?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I still don't know what that means.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I still don't know what that means.
Yes.
Here.
Good for you.
I'd build a house.
You know what mortise and tenon is?
I can die trying.
Left you this place.
At least your father tried, George.
I know there's an explanation.
I need you to do me a favor.
God, you look like crap, George.
It's okay.
Because Dad left?
She's a little sad, is all.
I don't even care if he ever comes back.
Ring the bell before you try the door.
Where is he?
Where he always is.
He doesn't answer.
Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today.
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
Where have you been for a week?!
Four days.  I left to think.
What did you do with your dog?
Kurt's been feeding him.
But you can't call me while you think?
Why would they tow your truck?
I was parked in day parking.
Why call me?
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
Where will you live?
The garage.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
Not for the weekend.  For the summer.
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
One of you would end up dead.
At least we'll have a house to show for it.
I want him with me.
No, you don't.  Trust me.
I'm married.
I drove over and you were gone.
I can't leave the house?
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
No.  I was going to let you do that.
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
Let's go.
Well, for later then.
What?
I used to live here.
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
The first and the last.
I dreamed about your house last night.
Finished or unfinished?
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
Oh...with his ear infection!
The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
You're not well.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
I think so.
This was my very first slow dance.
Watch out for the smile, boys.
Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
I can hire workers to help me.
You've never said that before.
I can't pick you up.
If I weren't married?
I need to know.
I didn't think you'd come today.
Peter left me yesterday.
Left you?
What?
So could I.
It's not my back that's killing me.
Not a perfect day.
No.
Does Alyssa know?
Nothing.
You got any weed?
You got the money?
Don't even...I'm there.
I wasn't sure.
I could use the money.
Then you tell me, what just happened?
A man he respects.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
I'll make you something.
It would worry me.
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
We should take a vacation.
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
You can't go because of Sam?
I know.
What are you doing home?
I never asked for more.
That's the problem.
Please don't leave me.
Sam took them to a movie.
I'll be in the bedroom.
Take it off.
Either do you.
Hey.
You got a dog?
Why?
I didn't go in your room.
Depends on what I'd give up on.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it.
Yeah.
This is what he wants.
What did you say?
Dad said it first.
Can we really help build a house?
Yes, it is.
Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy!
Dad's home, already?
In the bedroom.
No, nigger.
Nigger.
That's my girl.
Better make it a week.
She's doing just fine.
And the baby?
He's a big one.
I'm talking about a haircut.
Cost you a pair of nylons.
Not for me, it ain't.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
No, but...
Then what's the problem?
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
She got married last month.
Married?
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
Want me to come back some other time?
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
Yes, sir.
I'll be right back.
Goodnight, Claude.
He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
Here!
I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
But I'm having a good time...
That's because I've never been here before.
I'm Sylvia. What's your name?
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
He looks like he can take care of himself.
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
Why would you want to go home? It's so early.
That's right! Good old Monroe...
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
A thumb? What do you mean, like cut it off? For ten bucks?  That include the tip?
Nothing.
You need collateral.
Like this?
My daddy gave me this watch.
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
I must have left my appetite outside, which is where I think we ought to be right now.
What'd you say?
Yeah, I want some pie.
What gave you that idea?
Here I am.
Guess we better get going, huh?
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
He even got my daddy's watch.
He's dead.
What ain't there?
Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
You know what I'm saying.
Forget it.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
I'm sure it don't.
Claude.
You still got that map?
Yeah.
I said you're soft.
New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
Let me take a look at that map.
You drew this?!
I'm stuck!
I'm serious, man. Don't mention it. Ever.
We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred and Sixty First Street.
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
Of course, he's in the lineup. There he goes right there. Hey, Babe...!
We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
Whatever.
Let me see that.
Make 'em throw strikes.
Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
Well, if that's the way it is...
That's the way it is.
Then I have nothing left to say to you.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
Bullets weren't the problem. That pie was too hot. Burned my tongue.
Don't touch that car.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
Back to New York for starters.
No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
What'd you say?
I said you're soft.
He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
Why the hell not?
Gimme that damn thing.
Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
I'm sorry, he's on medication...
I'm all right.
You ever done time before?
I try to moisturize regularly.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
Made just for you, Cookie.
How about some steak sauce?
No problem. Oh, boy!
Why ain't that pick swinging?
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
State of Mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. You got that?!
Move it out.
Movin' it out, boss.
My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
Of course nobody believed Ray and Claude.
Rayford!
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
It'll be too late.
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
I prefer bourbon.
I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
Why, my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back.
She give you that scar, too?
Like you shot Winston Hancock?
Jenny?
No, it says Marleen here.
Satchmo.
Me? Willie Long.
What are you in for, Willie?
That's a long story...
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
You found him.
Blacks welcome there?
Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
I just want somebody who won't put a bullet in my back once the truck is full.
You shouldn't have come here.
Please, get out of my mind!
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
I hear a train coming. Drink.
Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
It's just such a slap in the face.
Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
What do you think about... Earth?
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
It's our time, brother.
Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
All right. Let me out.
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
Don't do it!
Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
I'm calling you out, brother...
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
My mom wasn't a goat?
Try an angel.
An angel?
Angels don't get any older, son.
She's so nice.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
No.
He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
Oh. Sorry.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
Put it in your mouth.
I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
What can I do about it?
But those are my roommate's sodas...
The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
Everything's fine, pop.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
Yes, Jimmy.
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
I was just playing with you.
And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
How bad?
I'm too weak. The process has already begun.
Son, just do your best.
I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
That's what I'm thinkin'...
That's a pretty brassiere.
Thanks.
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Beast.
Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
Oh, would you grow up.
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
Yeah. You do it.
Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
We know where to find Nicky.
That way.
Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
So I followed him...
I was DeNiro!
All right...
Dude, it's us. Let us in.
Dude. Seriously?
I'll just go to Heaven.
You smell like coconuts.
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
I don't need luck. I'm good.
Andrew.
Really?
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
Uh, it's a deep south expression.
Good. I was concerned.
What was that?
Are you dead?
What are you doing?
I think I'm floating.
Why would you be floating?
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
Okay, I do. Get back up here.
East Rutherford.
I have to, Valerie.
That was Cassius!
From my dad's side of the family.
I love you.
I love you.
I don't know.
And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
If it's Cassius, yes.
Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
Yes. I would like my flask back.
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
Your turn.
You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
From? From? From?
Where do you send them?
You're a beautiful pair.
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
It'll be all right...
Up there.
Your own work?
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
Just wondered... what happens?
Well... you can't have them all.
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
Only a few? You're just not trying.
I'm in my party mood.
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
Did you ever see anybody renew?
Of course.
Anybody we know?
At Carousel tonight?
It has nothing to do with you.
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
I'm Mary 2.
Where do you live, Mary?
Here.
Why aren't you in Nursery?
I'm very smart.
When do you go up?
I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
Please... No.
You prefer women?
No.
Well then...?
He was killed.
Killed? Why do you use that word?
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
You felt sad. What's your name?
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
No.
No.
I thought I had to do something.
I changed my mind.
And now?
About what?
How a Sandman lives.
I'm listening.
I'm afraid to tell you.
I'm not armed.  Well?
Why is it wrong to run?
So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
Are you a 5 or a 6? 
Six. I go red next year.
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
Here I am.  Shall I come in?
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
Thanks... but I have the choice.
Of course.
Then it's still no.
I'm going to run.
Why tell me?
You know something.
About running, dying what?
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
How can I?
A Runner gave it to me.
And then you killed him, right?
I don't..
I don't have much time.
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
What do you need?
That's tomorrow.
I wish I could help you.
Maybe you'll think of something...
I wish I knew what you think I know.
If you trusted me, you'd know.
We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?
You're not going, are you?
That's nice.
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
I have.
But what is this -- why?
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
We'll be all right...  We will...
Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
Don't ever let go.
I won't.
Do you think he was telling the Truth?
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
...But I still have the choice...?
Of course.
Then the answer's yes...
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
One in a million, I suppose
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
To what?
And Sanctuary?
Beloved wife...
Are you sure?
Mother and Father said so... you know?
I don't know.
All this. All of it.
I don't know... but it does.
What's that?
At least it's over...
We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
Where are you going?
Oh, my...
Hello.
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
For as long as I can remember.
What kind of place is this?
Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
I have always been here...
Are there any other humans?
Gracious... no.
What makes you think so?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
Dead... they're dead... and buried.
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
No, no, no
Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.
All right.
I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.
Oh, yes... I think...
Can you make it back?
Oh my... I'll try.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
I don't think so.
Good... You up for a drive?
Sheila'll be at "Tops".
Sure, what's wrong with that?
Okay.
Listen.
No, I'm okay.
They're comin' with us.
Pile in.
What?
Yeah.
Sure, I'm okay.
What do you mean by that?
How I remember them. Not necessarily the way they happened.
What is?
No. Fred hates them.
Maid? Relative?
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Right... This just glided along.
Anybody else have a key to the house.
If anything else happens, you'll call us.
Ours, Ed.
You know what I think?
What's that, Ed?
Yeah, I remember.
Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner.
Me, too.
Can I call you?
It's me...
Hi.
I can't see you tonight.
Okay...
Me, too.
I'll call you again.
Are you positive he knows?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
So what do we do?
I don't know.
We should stop seeing each other.
No... no.
I used to.
He works for Mr. Eddy.
What's he do?
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
How'd it happen, Alice?
Andy?
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
Alice, I...
We killed him.
You killed him.
Alice?
Up the stairs - down the hall.
Yes, I believe so.
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
Sit down a minute.
What's up?
Sit down.
The police called us.
Yeah? what did they want?
Did you tell the police this?
No.
His physical condition.
Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
Out in back.
You talk to him?
No... Here he comes.
You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
Did you ask him who he is?
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
What's the word on the street?
We'll get a tail put on him.
No, sir, it's not.
Who is it?
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
What about yesterday?
He didn't come home.
Pete, what happened to you?
No... I don't. Why?
Nothin'.
He won't give his name.
I don't know yet.
Not even close.
I... I didn't say anything...
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
Tone deaf.
The first night... Not the last two.
My... My head.
I can't give you anymore. I'll talk to the doctor.
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
What do you mean? You're where right now?
Alice who?
I thought I'd stay home and read.
That's why I married you.
Wake me up when you get home.
A videotape.
Who's it from?
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
Same one you were reading the other night?
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
Called? When?
From the club. You didn't answer.
Yes, I just found it on the step.
I guess so.
All right.
Two detectives are coming out.
Thanks, guys.
I wish I knew.
What?
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
But...
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
He's got some fucked up friends.
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
It's okay with Arnie... Come on, let's go.
All right!
Pornos?
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
You will.
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
You're my man, Pete.
Okay.
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
Who is this?
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
We just killed a couple of people...
Yeah?...
Yeah.
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
You want some company?
Sure.
Sorry... I...
I don't remember... What happened that night?
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
Sure. Sure I do.
You really don't remember?
No... I told you.
It was weird...
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
I don't want to talk about it...
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
Come on... get in.
I do like you, Sheila.
Yeah.
Come on.
What's the BITCH'S name?!
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Go home, Sheila.
Oh, read it!
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Yes.
Fossils, huh?
I'm a paleontologist.
A what?
A paleontologist.
Found in Asia!
Uh-huh.
Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
Don't call me brother.
Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
I beg your pardon.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
Good morning
I see.
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
Is it?
It certainly is.
Look here
Yes.
Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?
Do you think they're cannibals?
I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
Please don't call me Lovey.
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
Yes.
Horns? What kind of horns?
And be poisoned out here in the open?
This doesn't obligate me in any way.
They were in a quandary, and
Come on, Lovey.
Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
Nothing. Why?
Why, you look beautiful.
Over by that hill.
Look, Bob!
How do you do?
So there are others?
In time you will meet them all.
There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
Well, it must have taken
You're startled?
I surprise you? Now that's news.
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Shall we have another?
No thanks. Not tonight if you don't mind.
Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Please let me help you.
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
Then it's done.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
Thank you.
As far away as I ever want to be.
Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
Yes.
What is it, my son?
Hello? Colonel?
Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
You?
Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, sleep.
I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
Dead?
See that spot?
Yes.
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
I don't know.
That's what you said.
Well - I mean
Porters?
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
Let me go, Bob!
Chang! Chang! Chang!
All right. Sorry, George.
Porters?
Why - I'm sorry - but I
Why not? What's going to stop me?
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned
Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
Yes, the little Russian girl.
What's she got to do with it?
She's going with me.
The clothes?
Yes, everything!
What about the others?
was saying
There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
Why aren't you registered through our office?
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
What if he refuses?
Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
In for what?
We'd be eternally grateful if you
hope you'll forgive me for
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
A man whose life was empty!
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
Why?
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
English!
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
Yes.  Barney!
Please don't go.
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
Thank you.
Hesitated, sir.
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
The hell were you thinking?
It's not even a fucking door.
What the hell...
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
You got smeared.
And Goodwill Toward Man?
No. just peace on Earth.
I gotta be honest about something.
We're the government, Cowan.
What happens if I say no?
You do?
I'd go with number three.
What?  I thought you just--
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
What?  Who the hell are you?
INS, Washington.  Special services.
Sir--
Right.
I know, but we're on a college campus...
This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
Ha ha.  No, really.
It was a long time ago.-
Um-- Kay?
Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD.  Jay winces.
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
A what?
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
Gee.  You really think?
And what's this ... ?
What?
Where to?
I think that's what's happening...
Get back in the car!
We're rising.
The Pentagon.
I dunno, man.  Maybe we should.
What if he's telling the truth?
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
All of it?
I'd double it and add 20.
Right.  Oh, and here.
in case I need it?
In case I need it.
Kay!?
Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
You coulda told me what you were doing.
There wasn't time, sport!
Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.
Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
Yeah, right.  Even I can barely read all my work.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
Do have any idea what I just said?
Well, first of all, it's entomologist.
Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
What do we do?    Lean into it.
What the hell does that mean?
Actually... I don't know.
They respond to fear, right?
You figured what?
Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
You're not taking me in!
Did he say where?
How'd you know that?  Kay?
But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before.
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
Dee?  What are you doing here?
What do we have?  Are we showing anything?
They went right to the President.
Did it leave?
Actually, I don't know...
Oh shit!
Can you see?
They're inside.
Who?
Agatha...
Forget that guy --
Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.
He'll turn around.
He won't.
Wait.
Anderton, leave.
What is it?
Someplace safe.
I have to go back.
I am going back.  I see myself there.
Who wanted her little girl back?
She grew up.
RUN!
Then who was he?
Just some guy... they found.
Found?  Where?
Somewhere.
Because I found out about her...
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
It's all I could safely move.
We know each other?
Oh, yes.
Yes, you did.
You made those tapes...
They were performance pieces.
You set your patients on fire!
Here --
I can't even stand up --
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
For that, we have to go for a ride.
... Graveyard shift.
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
Don't worry, Lamar.
The nation votes this week...
Don't apologize, John.
Tuck in your shirt.
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
What?
In the middle of the night?
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
Somebody named Leo Crow.
And who the hell is that?
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
Can you fake the cerebral output?
I'm not getting halo'd.
You can't run --
Everybody runs.
Beauty?  The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
You're kidding, that's today?
I show a cop on horseback.
You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
Run the subscription list...
No maglev system.
The mall?
Georgetown.
Now look at him...
Did he close the front door?
Sir?
Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
Any ID on the shooter yet?
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
Because it was going to fall.
You're certain?
Yes.
Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
Really?  You've never been inside?
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
If it's a question of authority.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
But you call this room the "temple".
Just a nickname.
Well, hello there, honey-pie.
She's a precog?
That's right.
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
Then take her to Radio Shack.
Tell me how.
I guess that's all of it.
Uh, I'll try...
That's great.
I love you, too!  I love you daddy.  Love ya, dad.
All right, I'll try...
You gotta have faith, Dad.
Wanna hear something funny?
No.  He got tired of pretending.
Oh, Sean --
Good-bye, Dad...
I'm your son.  I'm you.
Sean, wait...
Hold your breath, Dad...
Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
No.
The precogs were wrong.
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
Who made you do this?
Kill me!
Tell me!
Good-bye, Crow.
I'm a little dizzy...
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
And how would I know that?
You're talking about the precogs...
And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
So you won't help me?
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
I believe in that system...
Do you?  Really?
Hold that thought.
Why should I trust you?
The safest place of all.
-- and then walk out.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
The female.
He's dead, Lara.
Oh, God, what did you do?
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
Then how did he --
I thought you were retiring?
He also said Crow was a fake.
Tell him not now.
He just wanted a few minutes before --
I'll be right there.
My God...
Thank you.  This is Burgess.
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
What?
Wait, just a second...
Not quite.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
Nice to meet you.  Gum?
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
Because he thinks he's innocent.
We can stop him.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
I don't know, why?
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
None.  This was arranged.
Who?
I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
Sure.  Raincheck.
I know who you are.
Yes.
Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
Cream and sugar.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
We used to, every summer.
He's not here now, is he?
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
That was our apartment.
Have you been there recently?
You mean after he lost your son.
It was nobody's fault.
But John was with him at the pool?
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
To what?  Trap him?
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
Tell me how all this works.
Yeah.
You sure? I just made it.
No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks.
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
Then put my Martel's in a snifter.
Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
Is it a good room?
I can take you down there.
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Are you sure?
Yeah. Take it.
Thank you very much, sir.
So?
Is it the good room?
All the suites are about the same.
What if I gave you forty?
Thank you, sir.
Where's the place to go tonight?
As far as...?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
Women?
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
Manhattan.
So you're models?
Should I fuck him?
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
He's great, right. Is he great?
He's alright.
I know.
We used to take baths together.
Come on. Let's go.
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
She's, uh, sleeping.
It's daytime.
Chloe?
Uncle Bobby?
Mommy's not home?
No.
What time is it there?
Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.
Where were you?
No. What kind of bachelor party?
The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
I'm ready.
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
Go.
With what?
Max offered to stake me.
Don't get my hopes up. If I quit, what then? I can't go through this again.
How could you let her see this?
There's no touching.
But what about them?
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
I don't get it.
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
Well, you look it. You win?
What's your record at?
5-5-1.
You driving her?
Yeah.
Get away from her.
Excuse --
Yeah. Where is he?
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
Brooklyn.
Yeah?
What do you mean 'troughed?'
Quick drop. In and out.
Where's Ricky?
Ricky's taken care of.
How so?
That's it.
Where's Ricky.
Sure. Yeah.
You bet the ponies?
Me? No. Not really.
A million. Easy.
She was fast, huh?
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
Not driving Jess, you won't.
What?
I didn't say that.
Then what are you saying?
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
You told him you liked him.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
You vouch for him?
What is it?
You want --
Take a few days --
Tom, the Welsh dude --
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
Traveling light. I like that.
Soho.
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
No. Just the cross streets.
Well, this is the corner.
No. That's cool, man.
Yeah.
Depends what night.
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
Understand me?
Yeah.
Ricky's taken care of.
Taken care of?
Yeah, he's getting there on his own.
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
It's important.
I be off in a minute.  Say again...?
Ruiz isn't here.
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
He's not here.
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
Any time, bro.
Thanks.
What about boxing?
What about it?
What are you saying?
So, it was a draw.
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
So, it's not a winning record.
It's not losing record.
How am I being shitty?
Don't be shitty.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
Yeah. I know the number.
Ask if he said anything to her.
I'll page you with the number.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
Then why do you try to get in?
Shhh...
We don't need guns.
He didn't say we need guns.
He implied it.
I'll beat your ass --
Sorry coach.
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
It's not even yours.
I like it.
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
I don't know.
Is that the woman from..?
To keep?
Pretty nice.
I'll get the girl.
Nah, don't bother --
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
No. Look. There.
You sure?
Shhh... Hello, room service?
C'mon, man...
Forty-six.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Yeah, I guess.
Great. On my fucking room.
Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.
What are you doing?
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
Well, I don't want to walk.
They didn't say an address?
I told you what they said.
Nothing else.
Nothing.
They asked who it was.
So they said more than the address.
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
What the fuck do you...
Sold it, stole it, whatever...
Motherfucker...
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
What the fuck is that supposed --
I mean, that's what I heard --
You got something to say --
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
Yeah. What vibe?
Like I said, I don't know.
He woulda told us right?
You would think.
So we're working?
About what?
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
You too?
Back in.
You fucking nuts?
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
We're not getting whacked.
It's not a 'sit down.' He said he's telling us the plan.
C'mon, man...
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
Yeah. Where they gonna whack us?
You want us strapped, don't you?
I'm your soldier.
The penguin house.
Did you hear what he just said?
I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
We don't need guns.
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
Float me a hundred bucks.
No.
What do you have left?
Eighty bucks?!?
Eighty five.
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
It's gonna be fine.
No more, man.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
Let's just go now and wait.
Three and a half hours?
I don't want to take any more chances.
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
I'll be a minute.
Fine, fine. And you were...?
Bobby and Ricky.
Right, right. The 'thugs.'
Fuck...
And you grew up in Manhattan?
Kinda. Yeah.
What do you mean 'kinda?'
You want your surprise?
Yeah. I want it.
Well, come on then. It's back here.
I didn't do anything --
How is it you're good? You on a list?
You see a Ricky Slade?
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
S'up.
You look good, man.
Cool. See you later.
Cool.
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
How much is what?
The videos.
Drinks are free, right?
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
Where do you live?
Excuse me.
Where do you live?
'Strapped?'
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
Why? What I say bad?
What? Why am I bad?
You really in trouble?
Stop.
Watch it...
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
No?
Pity. What's say we have a drink?
Does anyone want another?
You want another drink?
I hear the China Club is a laugh.
A little Charlie, perhaps.
Coke?
No, really, mate?
Here...
How's it going?
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
Come, now. You just got here.
Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
Nah, man...
You think it's funny, motherfucker?
Soho Grand, right?
The Soho Grand?
Yeah.
You're from LA, right?
Yeah.
You'll love it.
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
You know my pager number?
No. What is it?
The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
Different.
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
Four fernet.
You rode?
Yes. You're going to New York.
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
That money is your per diem.
And where do we bring it?
What?
What about my keys?
Tell me.
Don't worry. I get it.
So tell me how it is.
You want... Why are you picking on me?
We're square.
Yes, sir.
What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
Outfit? What's he talking about?
What?
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
And where might that be?
Bet you like that shit.
Keeps me out of the army.
Where I come from. Boston.
How 'bout that?
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
I like you, country.
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
Lemme write it down for you.
Yes, sir.
Why?
Just now.
Solid, daddy.
I'm working on it.
I'll take your goddam bet.
What you talking?
You owe me six big ones.
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
The bitch was there.
I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
You know it.
I'll give you back the 600.
I don't want your money.
I'm wearing, Archie.
There's two guns on you.
That's what it is. Walk on out.
Let Billie finish.
Now.
That really you, Red?
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
That's a fact. What you do, boy?
You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
Man, what do you want?
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
What did you give it to me for then?
'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
Don't con me. Don't try...
Okay, okay.
Don't con me.
What do you do with your time?
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
Where am I gonna start?
A Muslim must be strikingly upright. Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see the power of the light.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
I can't.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
I don't know how.
I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty.
No, Brother Minister.
She ate.
You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad.
Delicious.
There's nothing to talk about.
Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good wife.
I know.
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
Yes. Did you eat?
I love you.
Just hold me.
It will be rough.
Hush your mouth.
I'll be away a lot.
You're with me even when you're away.
Because you're in trouble.
How do you know?
The talk is everywhere!
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
What do you want me to do?
You have to sleep for three.
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
Let some of us come down there.
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
Is my family here yet?
Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
I don't think we know for certain.
That's right.
Just what is your question?
What color were the original Hebrews?
Then we don't know that God was white.
Yes, sir, I did.
Sure, man.
Are you Elijah's pimp?
What?
Say what you're saying.
And like a fool I believe it.
With him?
If she got eyes, she do.
Burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years...
The sentences to run concurrently.
Now you come back.
I ain't stupid.
I mean it's late, baby.
I know where you're going.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
Your control over your children, therefore --
Did you hear me?!
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation.
Please make way, please --
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
No. You'll be marked for death.
Let me die then.
And don't come back.
...That isn't a whore?
You better believe it.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Well, all reet, then.
Shorty, this is Laura.
Fine as May wine.
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
I'm not too short to be Cagney.
I ain't doing bad.
Tell him about Baldy.
Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
Head nigger in charge?
I'm the man.
Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
Eddie, let's see that blotter.
Yes sir.
Are you sure?
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
[South America.]
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
[I'm on to Juarez.]
[Why?]
[I have a friend there.]
I guess that makes you the smart one.
We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Where?
[Si.]
[Daniel.]
[The what?]
[Who killed her? You?]
[No!]
[Don't lie to me.]
[The boss did or his brother.]
[Who's the boss?]
[Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[You are Jorge Ramirez.]
[Who are you?]
[I am the President of La Hermanidad.]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[Where do I find him?]
[I don't know. No one knows.]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[One-one-three Arco Iris. Third floor.]
[I want you.]
[I told you, non-negotiable.]
[Her life for your life.]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[You stole the drop.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
[The ransom was ten.]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
Have you used this type before?
It's loaded.
How does it affect you?
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
I'm here.
What do you mean, I'm here?
Nothing wrong.
Don't give me that bullshit.
Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.
I came to visit you.
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Creasy...
The United States.
I know. But which state?
Why not?
I'm looking for potential.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
Someone gave him more money than we could.
That's right.
No.
Not at all?
No.
But why not?
I'm not crying.
I go to school, don't I?
Do you think he'll come back?
Maybe. Did you hear him?
No.
Well, I let him go.
It's better to be free, right?
Yes. Actually, he was driving me crazy.
They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
Where?
Everywhere!
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
I don't talk to them much. Does he have a name?
Yes.
You need to practice.
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
You feel sorry for the husband?
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
Don't worry. You will.
I guess that really does make me a hard case.
Did you used to?
Yeah. Two or three.
I'm sorry.
I dropped her at home.
I know you're not.
Are you afraid of me?
The gunshot holds no fear.
Your father has business.
Could I stop you?
You don't drink like you used to.
That's not a question.
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
So are you.
The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
Because...  I was already dead.
Planned what?
It's Creasy.
Where are you?
What was her name?
Camila. Camila Valencias.
Do you know what she told me last night?
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
I'm trying, mom.
This is Mr. Creasy.
You do?
Don't forget your towel.
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
I think it's fantastic.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
Creasy.
It's not.
He has to go.
She's young. She'll get over it.
I wasn't thinking of Pinta.
[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
[I should start going for your tits first.]
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
You helped him get this job.
What happened to him? What happened to Creasy?
This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
What?
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
I could see she likes you.
Yeah, sure.
I'll call her up.
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
I think this number is a little fast. Wait a minute.
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
You want me to ride down with you?
It's early.
It must be one o'clock.
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
Where you going?
Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
I came to see you. How you feel?
That's nice.
I don't think I remember him.
Well, he died. You know who else died?
Well, it ain't your baby.
She gave me the evil eye.
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
What they say?
I know it pains.
Your son Marty?
Benjamin Franklin High School.
Yes, I know.
Come on inna dining room.
Sure. Just take off your coat a minute.
Maybe that would be a good idea.
No...
Please...
Marty...
Nothing.
Nothing.
We just live one flight up.
So I'll call you tomorrow.
Okay.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
Well, siddown a minute. I just come inna house. I'll take off my coat. Siddown a minute.
Goodnight.
No, I'm not kidding.
Where you going now?
I'll see you.
Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
Oh, that's a sad story.
About eight o'clock.
Sure, great if you ain't married.
No, I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
You gonna die without a son.
So I'll die without a son.
Put on your blue suit...
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
Ma! Leave me alone!
Might as well siddown a minute, Clara.
I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
I don't know. I don't think so.
She didn't look Italian to me.
Don't bring her to the house no more.
What didn't you like about her?
You want a beer, Ang'?
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
You still owe me ten bucks from last week, if that's what you're working up to.
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
We gotta ask Marty, of course.
Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.
Hello, Thomas.
That's all right, that's all right...
On accounta...
I'm gonna see you tonight...
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
Okay.
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
Virginia, I don't wanna hear no more about it!
Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
She don't wanna use my pots and pans!
He's parted his moorings.
I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
They give you copies to burn.
How you, Radar?
Where?
Hospital.
Which hospital?
Back home.
Look at that right eye.
Epidural hematoma?
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
Same general idea.
You make a mean martini, kid.
What's there to do? You found the sliver.
Duke Forrest.
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
And gets the wind every time it opens. No, thanks. I'll take that one.
We been had.
We sure don't aim to cause any trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow on you.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
The chest-cutter.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
An application to Androscoggin College.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
Same here. You can retire my number.
Any time. Whenever we want.
Be right with you.
We could steal one of the choppers.
I looked. Suspicious bastards got them all locked up.
People will talk.
We're a good team.
We think the same way.
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
Anyway, we want to get this letter off.
Don't stop now! Please...
I can't... couldn't.
...trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against...
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
N-n-no thanks, G-General.
Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up.
What?
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
Oh, Jesus.
That's right. We work well together.
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
I think we could still have a chance.
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
It's possible
Hang in there.
No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
How did you get called that?
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
But I'm married.
Something else we have in common.
Very happily married.
Same here.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
Maria...
You're leaving tomorrow?
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
You're on his side all of the sudden?
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
Duke...
You really say the cutest things.
Yes, Reverend?
They're supposed to hold short-arm inspection.
Thanks.
Glad to help.
Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.
Let's get his clothes off quick.
Just in dreams?
You guys got any black capsules?
Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
You can cut the bow.
I have not understood what you means.
Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
I  wouldn't  wish  it  on  a  maneating  shark.
Nope, we're assigned heah.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
We don't want any more than that.  Right now.
There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
You mean who hit who?
Yes, that's what I mean.
I did. First and only blow. So far.
Yes, sir?
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Yes, Colonel.
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Morning, Captain.
I can try, sir.
What's that, Henry?
I out-coached that General Hammond.
Good morning.
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
Nice.
Arterial silk.
Boys, we're home free.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
He likes you well enough to stick around.
Um-hum.
Against anything. Just protest.
You got me.
Yes!
Hello.
No, thank you.
Yeah, that's the one.
John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
Thirty dollars.
No, no, nothat's your seat.
Yes. The John Doe Party.
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
The Websters!
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
What letter?
The letter from John Doe.
Oh!
We'll get a handwriting expert to  What!
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
John Doe.
What John Doe?
What John Doe?
Who, for instance?
Anybody! Er, erBeany'll do!
Plus a bonus.
What bonus?
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
Oh.
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Duets? But can we trust him?
Take it easy, John Doe.
No, no, no. Now that's too much!
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Has he been here?
No.
Have you seen him?
I ain't seen him for a week.
He's watching the other door.
Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.
Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!
Yeah, a little.
I used to pitch.
Baseball?
Where'd you play?
Beany!
Both of 'em?
Naw.
The heelots!
Who?
Who are they?
Sure. Mostly often.
It must be some kind of a gag.
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
The elevators are still runnin'.
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Yeh.
John Doe Club?
You betcha.
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for
Huh? Get what?
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.
Were you paid for itor weren't you?
Yes! I was paid! But the
Did you write itor didn't you?
No, I didn't write it, but
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
She isn't?
Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers.
Good night, John.
Well, I was thinking thatYeah, you know, sort of break the ice.
What do you mean, too bad?
Well, you know how they are in baseballif a guy's mixed up in a racket
Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
I didn't see anything.
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
SWAT wants to go in.
You're my hero.
Dinner's on you.
Deal.
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
I'll take half of your action.
Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
You don't want to know.
They want Walter dead!
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
Is that where you're family lives?
I need to get something straight first.
You're gettin' the car.
You got it.
Is there a problem?
I what?
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
What's the suspect's name?
Earl.
I have to go face to face.
Solis said to keep you clear of this.
Yep.
For now that's all.
Shut the fuck up and do what I say!
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
If you say so.
Only at the very end.
How do you feel after a shooting.
Like it had to be done.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
Try to remember that.
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
Recruited you from where?
National Marksman Competition.
You don't like New York?
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
It was okay.
You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
We could fill it with water.
I don't really like to drink.
You have to. It's a tradition.
Well, if I have to, I have to.
Why? You like my ass?
You living together?
Explain how that works.
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
Every couple of months, huh?
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
I think so.
It'll come. Try again.
So what do I say to this guy?
Get good at it.
It's against my nature.
Yes.
What's the first commandment?
Thou shall have no other God before me.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
Why?
Okay, stop.
You're a compulsive gambler?
I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta.
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
Still needs work.
To run last?
To run late!
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
Yeah, first and second.
COME ON, RUSSELL!
We lost.
We won.
How much you wanna bet?
About six years. My partner took me.
Occasionally you lose.
He's cutting down the visibility.
And doing a very good job of it.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
Pull up alongside.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
And what if you can't live with it?
You've got to decide that for yourself.
That's a chance I gotta take.
Only that floor.
You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
You worship yourself.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
This Greg is really getting in my way.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
Maybe you should be.
You heard.
Can I come in?
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
I've proved that, didn't I?
What do you want from me?
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
If you did, you never showed it.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
As a matter of fact, I do.
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
I've been craving that stuff all week.
And it's hard to get.
Mmm, needs a little something.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
It's okay. We broke up.
When?
It's very nice.
...Let me just show you.
And you think he'll...
Scottie...
Do it!
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
I've been thinking.
...the hell are you talking about?
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
The hell I am!
Prude.
I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
What?
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
Okay, I think I could swing that.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
What happened to your Trans Am?
I'll provide you with transportation.
I want to be put on this case.
Roper...
Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
Yeah, they are but...
Come on!
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
What do you want?
I need to take back what's mine.
Yes, I believe he has --
-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
Okay...
It's all been transferred.
To live forever.
Because I took it out of your memory.
If you could meet God, what would you say to him?
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
-- If your life's so good up there Gena, what are you doing down here?
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
About what?
Someone who believes in miracles.
Yes.
Guests?
Just like you always wanted.
That's the grace of this world.  Nothing's impossible.
From the dream.
Then what?
So wrong --
Yes.
You are not a God.
In here I am.
The new world.
It's not real.
Not real?
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
Me?  Of course not.  That's why you're here.
Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
Unfinished business.
Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
But what if he doesn't --
-- He will.
We're going to have to reconfigure.
How long?
At least a day.
New York.
The weather.
Who?
The woman you're stuck on.
There is no --
But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
-- Christoph changed the maze.
What?
The truth.
It's not used for anything.
He wouldn't say.
The truth.
Not his style.
Katie was digitized.
Why would I do that?
To hide the evidence.
Then where is she?
Come on Tanner, think this through.
Where?
Times Square.
Insurance.
Insurance?
Cleaning up a mess.
Some things never change, do they?
Tanner.
-- You told me.
What are you talking about?
Night City.
Once they digitized you, they added it.
It was a test.
For what?
You weren't real.
Yes.
Way you kiss me.
I know.
But you were with me.
Not you.  A copy.
What's the difference?
Sorry?!
You don't need a lawyer.  We found the program on your laptop.
This.  No point to it.
Why not?
Because you'll never believe me.
Try me.
There?
Just like that --
Program name?
Resurrection.
Describe program function.
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Checking connection.
-- Transmit now!
Male.
-- Waiter.
-- Standard.
Scanning body type.
Resurrection.
Access established.
Speed?
Wait a second...  What time is it?
We get Ivan into the Comets PATH--
... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!
Zordon...  he's gone.
They're called squirbs.
I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.
There should be a way to open it.
OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!
WHITE TIGER!
Activating Power Beam!
Thank you, Dulcea.  For everything.
What does that mean?!
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
... We must try to communicate with them.
About twenty seconds in your time.
TRICERATOPS!
I am the crane, agile and sublime!
WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!
NINJA WOLF ZORD!
We can take these guys!
Ryan's Comet!!
GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!
Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!
LET'S FLY!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
WE'RE OUTTA HERE!
Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.
Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
There's enough for everybody!
If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
A real shame.
Look closer.
... A falcon?
The legend goes that you release the power with the power.
Did I say anything?
Wait for me!
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
Quack like a'duck!
GO IVAN!!
What do you mean "basically"?
Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
We couldn't have done it better ourselves.
What's going on?!
NINJA FALCON ZORD!
The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
But I've never served a day.
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
And a lot more. Can we talk?
Charlie Luciano.
Tell me about it.
But not you.
Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
Not another word.
But from now on it's Lucky's spot.
Maybe that's why I'm the Boss.
Why should I be?
So what happened?
Life knocked me back.
And now you have everything.
No. Not everything.
What do you mean?
Scared.
I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
Can't we get a couple whores over?
What's that divided four ways?
From your mouth ta God's ear.
He's got a line on the good stuff.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
Shane was a friend of yours?
He was around...
Which is why he doesn't need us.
Who hired the bastard?
Maranzano. Ta ice you.
That ain't what your mama said.
Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach.
Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
I can just imagine.
No. They envy you.
For being a bootlegger?
For being a man.
No. I'm here with you.
I must be going.
For what?
I was calling yesterday.
Something came up.
I needed to see you again.
Same here.
You're sure?
You got something to hide?
It's too late.
Have you thought about this?
Why? You're the innocent one.
Guess I'm too confused to think.
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
So you all make the same mistakes?
Gives us something in common.
London?
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
It always is.
I'm doin' business here!
But there's...
A million bucks. In the last six months.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble?
Whatta ya mean? It's great!
I'll do fine.
I told you twenty!
It'll just be a few minutes.
I NEED THE TWENTY!
Tommy Reina.
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
Come off it, Bugs.
Ben-jamin.
They don't give a shit about us!
Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
Ya piss like a man.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
He's trying to make it.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
What the fuck does that mean?
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
I know about you.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
Didn't know you felt that way.
And I got it all planned.
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
They're friends of our enemy.
Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
Not stupid. Fat.
Couple hands. No harm in it.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
Not a lot ta know.
Don, I'd be honored.
I've got friends.
You get fifteen percent.
I got partners.
We learn from life.
That's why I'm here.
I'll take care of the Boss.
They do what I tell 'em.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
The terms will be mine.
What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
Thank you for keeping me informed.
We were overdue to get hit.
And what do you want out of this?
A peaceful and prosperous retirement.
Wanna know what I think?
Spare us.
There won't be any way to stay out of it.
Come on. Be polite.
Hell. It's been four days!
Fuck 'em.
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
If it comes to that. Yeah.
Yeah. But he needs me alive.
Luciano is dead?
Kill them! Kill them!
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
Now that's a hard number.
That a Jew compliment?
Best we got.
Kinda early for Christmas, Bugs.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
This is nice. I mean it.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
What?
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
Olive or eyeball?
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
I didn't say anything.
Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now.
Thank me next time you see me.
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God -
Why?
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
Sure. Why?
You're acting kind of...odd.
<i></i> In what way?
Ohhh, nothing.
Got a doctor on duty.
Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
I might wake up.
I don't think so.
Are you okay??
I'd better go report this...
It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
My <u>tail</u> itches.
Give me a date, Doctor.
Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING -
<u>What</u> union?
Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. - DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
I don't <u>know</u>.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
There's a thing here! There's a switch!
What?
Isn't that Lulu?
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
And you don't deal drugs?
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
You want to come inside?
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
You don't like where I live?
... What are they all doing there?
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
How are you doing sweetheart?
I'm good.
Dating anyone?
What about the fellow in those pictures?
You know ...  ... whoops!
Mother!
But I was dusting.
He seemed quite taken with you.
I don't want to talk about it.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Mm hmm.
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.
Oh.  You need a cappuccino.
He's an organic farmer.
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
You mean it's dangerous?
Forty-five all total.
Thirty is base price.  Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up.
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
Swell. Thanks very much.  Good luck, Senator. Keep your left up.
You've never *seen* this contract.
Never.
Looks like it, but--
But it *isn't*?
It couldn't be.
I'll brain that guy! Well--call Paine-- call Saunders--
Let's send out a pigeon!
Sure--sure. He must have a compass with him.
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
Okay. For the dollar, I give you McGann *and* Bill and Carl. I got Paine.  Hello... Oh, yes.
What's this, Diz?
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
What! Who?
Whadaya mean--*right*?
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
Certainly.  Now there's the principal actor in our little play.
You play--left field.
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
Yeah. What about the second act?
That's taking place outside now.
Paine.
Oh--yeah--
"There's more light here," he says--
Drunks are funny--
Yeah. Funny--
Yeah.
Every time I think of it, I get a laugh, Diz.
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
Diz--
Yeah.
How about getting married?
Any time.
Tonight?
Okay. You don't mind?
I'll cherish ya.
No.
Do we *have* to?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
Well, let's get going.
Where?
We're gonna get married.
What?
My first name's--Clarissa.
Yeah, I know. That's okay.
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
Right now--everything I own--!
You know, we're getting married.
Take me home, Diz.
That infernal phone!
What is it?
Sam Foley--dead!
Great saints!
Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?
Well, your children are very bright-- and *they* say Jefferson Smith.
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
All right, why?
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
Henry Hill.
We can't help *what* they were! Forget 'em!
I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!
*You won't?*
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
*But you never asked me*!
Oh--Jim!
I doubt it! Come on, Ken.
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
Is *what* getting me down?
Oh, a *boy*!
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
Jeff for Senator.
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Yes. Come in.
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
Certainly. Step right in.
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
I beg your pardon?
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
The porter's got them. They're coming.
Just a minute, I better make sure.
Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
What? Who?
You have?  Will you come in a minute, Miss Saunders.
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
Saunders said--this whole thing was *his* idea to get graft--!
Mr. President!
For a question!
"Boy Stuff." Why, printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff. You're just like your father.
Well, I'm sort of anxious to get back to the office--
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
Goodnight, Jeff.
Goodnight, Miss Paine.
Will he yield for a question?
Ah, now, that's better.
Will he *yield*?
For a *question*.
Mr. President--
No, Jeff--please--!
Jefferson--
Yes, Ma?
What?
How's Amos, Ma?
Just fine.
We'd better see.
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
Office of--Senator Smith?
*No*!
No!
J-Jefferson Smith.
The Dome--the Capitol Dome--
I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
You *couldn't*?
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
I see. *This* one is so simple--
And with your help--
A *day*!
Tonight.
Committee.
Why?
Good. Where are we?
What?
The Steering Committee.
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
We're over in the House.
Thanks very much.
And a *lot* of paper!
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
Yes, yes--
Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
Since sixteen or so.
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
No complaints.
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
It *is* not!
Abigail.
No!
Letitia.
No!
Lena.
No! Stop it!
I've got more. You better tell me.
You win. It's--Clarissa.
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Already? All these letters?
Oh--*Saunders*!
Saunders--
But--I've done everything I--
Hurray!
To a hard night's work, son. Come on! 
If you thought as much of being honest-- as you do of being smart--!
Then you *did* say it.
No--I mean--yes--that is--
I'm splendid, too.
That's--that's splendid.
And how's your bill, Senator?
No! No! Gosh. See, there you are! I'm not making sense!
I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--
How's that, buddy?
Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
Yeah? Well, when I get my hands on a red-headed doll with a southern lingo, I'll--
What do you mean? What's going on?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
A Bill! Not *him*!
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine.
What's the matter?
Let's get away from here. 
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
--now he wants to talk to the Congressmen from the Willet Creek districts--he's run their names down--
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
Oh, now--that won't do--
He's lost complete faith in me--
Well--me, too!
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
What are you talking about? What difference--?
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
Don't worry about Horace--he'll take orders. Come on--
You won't stand for it?
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
Just a minute, Joe!
You can't say *that* to--
Anything *better* to offer?
Maybe he won't get up.
But--if he *does*, Joe--
No--I--I'll take a walk-- 
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Do I actually *see* this--?
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
How nice. How do you do, Senator?
And Honest Abe's ideals. A rare man-- these days.
Senator Paine.
Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Some people like it.
Morning, neighbors. Morning.
Yes.
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
He was a seven-months baby.
Uh-huh.
And sings.
He sure is pixilated.
Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.
Yes, you own it.
Yes, indeedy.
He sure is.
Yes, sir.
Any children?
No, no children.
Next, please.
No.
Why not?
Would you like to go for a walk?
Are these the articles?
Yes!
Are they true!
NO!!
But they did take place?
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
And you saw them happen?
Yes, but I
It isn't all! I'd like to explain
That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
You are , aren't you?
Yes!!!
Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
Look, this is my house. I'd like to
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
Oh - uh - nothing.
Really?
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
What did they say?
Do you always wear your hair like that?
Uh-huh.
Yeah, let's.
That depends on what they see.
Now, what do you see?
Why don't you try?
Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
What did you mean by that?
Gosh! What do you know about that!
You have?
He did? I play the tuba
Yeah, I know.
What did he play?
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
I'll get my hat.
Are you? When?
In a day or so, I think.
I don't blame you.
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
Mary - I - excuse me
Nothing.
No. It's nothing.
I'm crucifying him.
Why? Why do we have to do it?
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
Running away is no solution.
We're not going out tonight.
With pay!
With pay!
Uh-huh.
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
Is he really that big a sap?
Had the boys follow us.
Last night he proposed to me.
Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
I'm going to tell him the truth.
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
I tell you that dame's nuts.
Hurry up!
Boy, was he burning.
Come on - let's go!
Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Who? Miss Dawson?
Yes, sir.
Me, sir?
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.
Fourteen carat?
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes sir.
Me sir?
Yes.
Perfect! Perfect!
I wish you luck, sir.
Let me go! I wanna see him!
He's not home, I tell you!
I wanna see that guy!
We'll send for the police!
Let me go!
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
This is outrageous!
Mr. Cedar!
Mr. Cedar!
You can't?
What?
That tuba player!
Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N
All set.
Yes.
How do you do.
How do you do.
Are your parents living?
He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to
Who - me? No.
No, thank you.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
I've got one for Cobb
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
No, thanks.
That's funny. Why is that?
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Oh.
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
What do you think bodyguards are for?
Are those stories true?
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
Why, it's an artistic institution
We own an opera house, don't we?
Naturally.
Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
Well, thanks, I - uh  How do you do? What is your name?
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
Yes, sir.
I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
No, I mean - about my client.
Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
Thank you, Your Honor.
I'm a writer myself, you know.
I write poetry.
Uh-huh.
Oh, the poet? Where?
I don't know.
Christian Svenson.
Farmer?
Yes, ma'am.
Where is your farm?
South Dakota - north?
South Dakota - but on the top.
Yeah. What?
Is Mary home?
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
Thank you so much. Good night.
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Excuse me. What did you say?
Every man to his taste, sir.
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
Yes, sir.
I just wanted to make sure.
What's that?
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
Prairie? Oysters?
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
I did what!
What two policemen?
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
You try it.
Me, sir?
Yeah.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir. Here it is right here, sir. There, sir.
Why are they ganging up against me?
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
Hmm?
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
Mr. Cook.
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
Were you supposed to have a session?
You're the shrink, aren't you?
No, not really.
But you do therapy?
Ernest, what do you think?
I think he's got a point.
It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! Are we listening to Lionel now?
Right now?
I don't want to hear any more today.
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
Stop now.
Why? I'm paying for this.
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
You find it distasteful, don't you?
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
I didn't hear you.
Now we're back on track.
You are so mean.
It's a thought I had.
Should I open it now?
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
But you did come to me.
My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
Doc. Nice to meet you.
Althea hasn't told you?
We've been talking about her, mostly.
She seems very unhappy.
What?
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
I'd better get in there.
That's a lot of people all at once.
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
You do?
Yeah.
Well, come on in.
My patient had to leave early.
Who was that?
It was Henry Follett.
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
Oh, I don't know...
You like me. How come?
Not sure. Let me think about it.
Doc.  Ainge...
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
You're on your own today, honey.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
...so accomplished.
Lily.
Doc.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
Sure I can, Lionel.
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
Thanks for your help, Lionel.
Don't need it.
That would explain it.
Can you help Mom?
I'm trying.
Got to.
Is she a friend of yours?
Martin.
Did you straighten her out?
We're going for a walk.
Do you think that's a good idea?
Oh... not a real doctor.
That's right, the fake kind.
What do you mean?
I think you know what I mean.
I think you do.
Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
Could I see Sofie, please?
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Oh boy... this should be interesting.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
Is she against you getting help?
We don't discuss it.
Something's bothering her.
What?
You've got a funny idea of funny.
No.
Really? What would it take?
Sorry... I'm done.
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
Life.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
Is that like a party trick?
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
It's all right.
And this is legitimate therapy?
Which thing?
Either one.
That's one way to put it.
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
You're upset.
Transference.
Hello.
Which show was that?
Sofie...
You're not the only one...
But...
I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
Will you think about it?
Will you wait for me?
We're only talking about six weeks.
Will you be here?
In maybe three or four issues.
Weekly or monthly?
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
It's a big part of the show.
Have women found you attractive?
What do you want me to see?
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
What are you talking about?
Was it something that happened at school?
True. Should we stop them?
He said -- "Which we already knew!"
How are you?
Nah... scotch.
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
Have you thought about getting a wife?
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
This is exactly what I wanted.
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
She's probably ten years older than you.
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
What kind of person do you have to be to do this?
This --
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
Jerking off?
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
You don't think I'm insane?
Definitely.
Just you.
It matters to me.
I can tell you anything else.
What about everything? How did this happen?
Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
Everybody has a story, Skip.
Sounds like you have several.
It wasn't the best situation.
Did you carry a gun?
You were messed up, man.
But look at me now...
You and Candy...?
That'd be Lily.
All new people start with that...
English Lit.
See you Thursday... regular time.
You want my advice? Far out!
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
Wow.
Yes, yes it does...
Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath?
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
Priests. Imhotep's priests.
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
Well, okay then.
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
Oh yes, of course.
And then killing your sister.
Did you say 'kill' my sister?
Then what the hell are you doing here!?
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
'Cause I look good doin, it.
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
Oh, hey, how ya doin'?
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
Do you know where I can steal some?
What friend? You're my only friend.
You shall see.
That's one way of putting it.
Oh yes, always.
Yeah! Them.
What is he doing here?
To have stopped this creature? Yes!
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
You will not believe it.
Try me.
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
If we want to kill the creature, yes.
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
Water turning to blood.
What did you do to him!?
Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
To be hanged.
I am an English woman.
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
Proceed!
Three hundred pounds!
I would never!
Twenty.
Forty.
Broad?!
No?
Because that's where I found it. I was there.
I just decked your brother
Yes, well...  I know my brother.
You swear?
Every damn day.
No, I mean --
I found sand. I saw death.
Really want to know?
Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
If you call that a kiss.
The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
Are you sure?
The things that get you excited.
Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.
Preparation for what?
For entering the afterlife.
You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
You don't believe in curses, huh?
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
No you're not.
I'm not?
Not unless you call me Rick.
Why would I do that?
Because that's my name.
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here!
It's everybody's problem!
The creature!? Are you sure!?
Got what?
I have no choice.
Yes?
I think you found something.
You lied to me!
That just makes you more gullible.
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
Way to go, Evy.
Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit.
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
Did you ever see him eat?
Well neither do I, thank you.
Shut-up and get me off of here!
Read the inscription on the cover!
Oh.
Yes,... I see.
Um, well, you see...
Awfully.
Be nice. That thing saved my life.
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
And you're sure you can find the secret compartment?
If he decides to wake up, hell yes!
Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!
What?
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
You have got to be joking?
I knew you'd know.
I know you knew I'd know.
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
Except for one little thing.
And what's that?
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
It must have slipped my mind.
Your mind is so slippery.
Head hunting.
One last tweak.
I'll be down in a jiffy.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
Do I?
The Disco Boys.
My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
I was eight.
And some sandwiches --
Do it, big boy!
Atta, boy!
Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
I'm the Bowler.
He was cute though.
The Inscrutable Six?
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
Me, too.
Let's do it.
I thought you'd never ask.
Half a Dirty Dozen!
I dunno.
Hello?
Sure.
Doctor Heller?
Yes!
It's me... Elizabeth.
How's your dad?
He's dead.
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
Get on to yourself!
Think positive.
What about Captain Amazing?
Should I kill them?
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Are you with me... or against me?
Too bad. PLUG HIM!
So are you!
Frankenstein!
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
Just a waitress.
You underestimate yourself.
Just wanted to... powder my nose.
Me.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Then why are you here?
Curiosity.
Remember the cat.
You're a spy.
Roy.
Or you'll what? CAN ME?
Only when I'm awake... You busy after work?
Not tonight. 
Alone tonight?
Every night.
Yeah.
That was easy. 
Why?
Who wouldn't?
What's your real name?
Roy.
Have you always lived here?
That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.
Monica, where are you?
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
I'm going inside.
What are you talking about?
Then at least I will have died trying, right?
Bye. 
Monica!
Good or evil, what's the difference?
And you are a fool.
And a skunk stinks!
When I am sure I am among friends.
LOOK!
We had an off night, that's all.
So when are we gonna have an on night?
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
Yeah yeah -- and that, too.
How could I see him if he's invisible?
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
But I just don't feel it.
Are you coming or not?
I'll drive.
Not a chance!
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
A vague similarity? IT'S THE SAME GUY!
So why don't you just tell her!
Why not?
Who's chicken? 
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
See ya tomorrow.
But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
Shhh.
He hasn't stolen it yet.
Come on.
The Eradicators!
Anybody got any?
Hey... he's gone.
Really? Like Captain Amazing?
Not yet.
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
Ow.
Oh hi, Mom.
Looking for... the TV Guide.
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!
I use it... to fight evil.
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
Definitely.
Ask her out.
Who are they?
The Disco Boys.
This looks like a job for Superman --
Or both.
Sorry.
Be a Mohican. 
The who?
Yeah, but how do we get to them?
Whatever our name is.
Are you sure he's still alive?
The bazookas?
And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
But how do we get in?
It's suicide.
Great timing!
May the forks be with us!
Right.
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
Ah -- you approve?
I think it's absolutely charming.
I'm glad you like it.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
I did, sir.
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
Things are quite serious, I should say.
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
What forces do you have at your disposal?
Cavalry?
There are none here.
Where are they?
You could have them here by daybreak.
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
Properly arranged, yes.
These are odds of 8 to 1.
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
Our lives, the revolution, my career?
And where is the army?
It is on this road, sire, following me.
And who is defending Paris?
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
And where is Joseph?
Bertrand, sire.
Come back in an hour.
Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
A glass of champagne, please.
Bastia -- and you?
Ajaccio.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
Why are you carrying the dog?
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
Four o'clock.
My God, what a fire!
The first reports came in at about ten.
Why didn't you wake me then?
How did it spread so quickly?
It is the work of incendiaries.
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
I am, Citizen.  Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?
Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
Yes -- an excellent idea.
I very much doubt that he will.
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
Would you like some brandy?
I'll have the fire built up.
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Lisette.
Only Lisette?
Lisette La Croix.
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
Junot?
Not even the slightest hint of something?
When is she supposed to return?
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
May I offer you a drink?
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
Yes, of course.  Hortense, darling, will you tell Louise to bring some sherry?
Do you expect me to believe that?
Were they pretty?
Yes.
One had better legs.
Were any of them married?
I cannot promise you that.
Promise me.
I will never forgive you.
Promise.
Promises mean nothing.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
All right -- I promise.
You are my old friend.
Open the door.  It's me.
Go away -- I'm busy.
I know what you're doing in there.
What are you doing in there?
Yes!!
Five minutes.
Goodbye.
Yes.
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
It's me.
Why did you give it to him?
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
I wrote it.
What?
Yes, I wrote it.
You wrote it.
I couldn't face telling you.
You couldn't face telling me what?
About Hippolyte Charles.
What was there to tell?
My God, what do you think?
God help me -- yes.
How do you know?
I know.
How do you know?
Yes.
Yes, of course.  What do you want?
I believe so.  I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet, in Paris.
You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
Yes, I do -- very much.
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
Yes, he has.
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
Eugene de Beauharnais.
Is he alone?
Yes, sir.
Show him in.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
Send him in.
Let me have it.
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
That's it?
Go, fo' I change my mind.
Naw, it ain't like that.
Well, let me in.
Why you say that?
'Cause your lips is getting black.
Suga!
Don't move me.
I'm his cousin.
Yes you did.
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
I'll do it.
What happen?
I'm gone.
Come on, Day, try it.  For moms.
It's something in that hydraulic pump.
What about the dog?
Cheeco.
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
That's the sister.
What you mean, so?
Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
Okay, plan B.
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
You already in.
That ain't gonna work.
Still gonna smell it.
Out the door and to the left.
Sorry about today, man.
I didn't see nothing.
How you know?  It could be anything.
Naw, you go first.
You go first.
No.
I ain't scared of you.  We ain't little no more.
Wait for what?
What about me?
I don't know.  Probably next Friday.
Oh yeah, why you walking?
My brothers won't give me a ride.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
Better sooner than later.
What are you doing here?
Make sure.
So what?  Let's make'em wait.
Okay.
Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
Hold on.
I said hold on!
Well bring yo' ass on...
It ain't about being a punk, son.  It's about this...
What it smell like?
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
It's alright.
I'll remember.
I saw it.
Smokin' what?
Nothing.
Peace out, Craig.
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
I don't have no damn cover.
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
Well, you gonna have to go postal then.
You damn right that's the big one.
You don't wanna know.
Negative...they vamped.
R-U-S-H Intensely.
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
Let it go, Roach, trust me.
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
Where's Craig?
He's inside the house?
Why did he go in the house?
Go for it.
This is a knock.
Bite his ear!
He's a boy, dude.
I got fired too.
What?!
Sorry, my ass.
I don't know.
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
I don't believe this sugar shit. Something ain't right.
Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?
I don't know, Debo.
Yeah.
I don't know the number.
Keep pushing.
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
I don't know.
Huh?
Good, let's get out.
I don't know.
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
Nothing.  What you want?
'Take your car?'
Yeah, and hurry up.
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
Don't get it twisted, Elroy.  I ain't lost none of my street skills.
I got my mase.
Shut yo' ass up.
The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.
What's the matter?
Craig, you ain't the only lightweight around here.
I threw my back, again.
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!
Who, him? Just visiting.
What happened here?
Nothing. I broke a lamp.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
I've been a bad boy.
What?
Uh, yes..
Business or pleasure?
Business.
San Diego.
What?
The grave. Somebody close?
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
Its'...ah...about my daughter....
I...
Yes?
Of course.  I wish everything were that easy.
My security people are right next door.
I appreciate that.
I have a problem.
Ah.
You were very nervous.
No.
Who did?
What the hell are you saying?
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
I would also like to apologize.
For not believing you.
Same to you.
I'd like to know what...
Don't worry. She's good with kids.
Good.
What's your point?
I will do no such thing.
Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
Unless you do what you're told. Go do it!
Where did you get these? Who are you?
The gun...
What about the gun?
Then I have time for a drink.
He's dead?
How should I...?
Tell me why he's dead.
You fucked up.
I kill her - and you kill me.
Keep your voice down.
Even if you don't, Her Security men will.
That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
No, please...
That's right. That gives you...
Let me talk to her again.
Forget about it.
You know what I'm gonna do.
What? Walk out there and twist her arm off?
No, that's,..that's fine
No! You can't! They're in on it.
I think you're right.
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
Nods.
Let' s do it.
Yes. Yes, I can hear you.
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
I know you do, honey.
I promise.
No...kisses to you.
Keep it.
It's a twenty.
Keep it.
Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
I remember. The big tipper.
Please. Something is going to happen...
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
What?
Kill the Governor.
Don't think I won't.
Hi.
Irene is going to help.
Thank you.
I don't know.
What are you going to do now?
Thanks for the tip.
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
I don't think so.
You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that!
Gimme a dollar.
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
I've done much better ones than this.
You have, huh?
You're a big girl, huh?
Why?
I've got something for you.
A surprise?
Yeah.
It doesn't look like it.
It better be.
Help me get her off the rug.
Nah.  Hates his wife.
What about them?
Where?
Right there.
I kill her anyway.
You're wasting time.
'Daddy has to go now.
Do it!
Yeah.
Put her on.
What gives?
Just put her on.
No.
He carried on some; kicked.
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Listen to me John.
Dad, you're bleeding...
You understand?
Not even her?
And I won't never tell about the money.
I been mindin' Pearl.
How's your sister Pearl?
Just fine.
Well goodnight, boy. Come again -- any time.
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
Don't!
It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.
She went.
You have all sinned!
Yes! Yes!
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
How do you mean?
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
About what!
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Sshhh! He's in there.
I'll be switched!...
All to pieces!
A man of the Cloth?
Bluebeard!
Twenty-five wives!
Tricked us!
He's Satan hiding behind the Cross!
John don't like him much.
Pearl dotes on him.
What?
The money, Icey.
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
Get along with you.
Ah.
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
Thank you, no. Thank you, dear Icey. I'll tend to them. Thank you.
There! What's so hard about that!
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
Blue men.
You better not sing that song.
'Cause you're too little.
Sshhh...
Hm?
John! Don't!
Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
She's gone to Moundsville.
Yes, I reckon that's it.
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
No, that's just it. No.
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
It'll spoil our supper.
Hush, Pearl. Come on.
John, where are we g --
Hush.
Ssh...
Dead.
Dead. 
Up river.
I mind you said there was two.
Well, shoot! Maybe there was!
I'll make coffee.
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
Nothin'!
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
The summer is young yet, little lad.  Pearl?
I'll tell.
Don't you believe me?
Why sure, boy, sure.
You could save him, little bird.
Come to me, boy!
I'll tell you a secret.
Yes?
Now it's your turn.
What secret shall I tell?
How old are you?
That's no secret. I'm five.
What's your name?
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
All right.
Where's the money hid.
Can I have milk too?
No.
Why, pray tell?
Because John said I mustn't.
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
Can I have this?
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
Pearl and John.
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
Only she won't never let me play with it.
Yes; from the first night.
The first night?
Our honeymoon.
How's that?
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
I was praying.
Harry, what --
Get up.
I'm through, Harry.
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
How'do.
It's about that John and that Pearl?
Where's your Missus?
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
Didn't you hear me, boy?
Them kids!
What are you after them for?
None of your business, Madam.
This man down at the Drugstore...
The Drugstore?
I been out with men.
He never asked me for nothin'.
Pearl and John.
John and Pearl!
What?
Since the murder. She was fine before that.
Thank God.
Get the kit!
Jesus.
Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
Because he was scary, that's why.
Who was scary?
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
Haven't slept, have you?
Not really.
Okay, okay.  I think.
Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
Just checking -- keep out of sight!
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
Well what you reading it for?
Hi.
Oh. Hi, how y'doing?
The killer.
You do?
My dream.
How you plan to do that?
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
Okay. Hi, dad.
What?
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
Just want to talk to him a second.
You don't know he did it.
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
Krueger.
Krueger?
Maybe you don't think murder's serious --
School.
Right home after. See you.
I won't.
Get into bed.
I will.
Great
To bed with you, c'mon.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
Nancy?
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
Put that damned thing down!
Nancy!
S'curity.
Proof he's declawed. As for him, we buried him good and deep.
Just sleep now, Mom.
We should get her out of here...
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
You were screaming like crazy.
The door was locked from your side.
How the fuck do I know?  I don't expect you to believe me.
Because somebody cut her. While I watched.
He's nuts about you.
Yeah, nuts.
Really. Turn 'er up a little.
Rod and I are done. He's too much of a maniac.
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
Jungle man fix Jane.
No more fights?
No more fights.
Have you any money?
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Bring me forty-five back.
Naturally, Comrade.
It's from Paris.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
Aren't you late?
What are you serving?
An omelet.
And you too, Ninotchka.
About what?
You should. I'll show you.
What was it like?
Evening gown?
What do you wear in the morning?
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
Just for the honeymoon.
He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
...and little Lady Beatrice?
Possibly.
...des raisins de Madre, des framboises... 
Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?
What is it?
And they might believe her in Moscow.
What do you mean they might -- they will!
Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
That's right... and we might as well face it.
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
How many families live here with you?
Just see how happy the people look... from here....
Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
Monsieur.
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
Why should you be afraid?
You didn't get legal advice?
Yes, Comrade?
With two f's, if you please.
Don't worry... there will be enough.
I must be stern with you.
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
We have opened a restaurant...
The former Duchess!
Oh, yes, yes.
Good morning, Gaston.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
That's all right.
Good evening, Monsieur.
I don't feel like any breakfast.
Eight forty-two, sir.
I guess it is eight forty-two.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
Yes, General Savitzky?
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
Thank you, Louis.
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
What is it, my boy?
Oh, Leon, you are so good.
How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
While you eat, you look at the view.
It's a real Paris reunion.
...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
...Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves... into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
If you want to see us you must come later.
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
Get out of here!
Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow.
I'll send you a muff.
I think she covered you with the parasites.
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Comrade.
Comrade Kopalski...
Comrade.
Two thousand francs.
A day.
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
Look for yourselves.
Monsieur.
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
But, gentlemen, I am afraid...
Right away... instantly!
All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!
Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
No, thank you.
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
Well, we're back home.
And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.
Don't hold that against me... please!
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
What business?
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
No visa.
Oh no. No visa.
On what?
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Me?
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
At what intervals does he whistle?
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You might hold this for me.
Love to.
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
I'll try.
Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
Yes, very strange.
Then you don't want me to go there.
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.
Ni-notchka.
That is correct.
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
Thank you.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
Don't do it, please.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
Wounded? How?
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
It's twelve o'clock.
No, that was restful. Again.
The telephone is ringing.
Oh, let it ring.
Let's forget that we ever met.
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
Then do it through my lawyer!
I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
I didn't follow you.
Then how did you get here?
I always eat here.
This is a place for workmen.
Must one always be after something?
Will you smile?
At what?
Then you should go back to your table.
Do you like Scotch stories?
I have never heard one.
No.
For twelve francs, seventy-five.
Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
Did you make any change in this room?
I don't think so.
And General Savitzky.
You must, darling.
To the loveliest story I ever heard.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
Thursday.
Darling, darling... please!
I must talk to my brothers!
Shhh! Shhh!
Comrades! Good people of France!
Now, Ninotchka... please!
No speech.
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
And I adore you, Ninotchua.
No. Nobody will find us.
Yes... a little white house.
Not white, darling.
All right, we'll make it red.
...and we won't clench our fist...
No! No!
Yes... a kiss... salute!
Much happier.
All right.
Radio! What is radio?
No, no music.
But I can throw it out of the window.
It is their wish.
So happy and so tired.
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
Good morning, Swana.
Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand francs!
Huh?
That bad?  Old or young?
Is this your new dress suit?
Yes, Swana.
Am I interrupting?
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
I'm afraid that's what it is.
She's gone, Leon.
Do you expect me to believe that?
Hello.
What?
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
I must ask you to leave.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
In that case I can only say good-by.
What do you want?
May I have your bags, madame?
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
That depends on the tip.
Please... sit down.
Thank you.
Yes... leaving immediately.
But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
At Pre Mathieu's.
Where is it?
How do you do, my friend.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
Then tell Richardson to fire him.
Never.  I never said that about Jews!
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
Yeah?  Well, I own the fucking casino.
Then what about this Washington Post crap?  Woodwind and Fernstein?
Uh huh ...
Nobody knows more about this thing than you do, John.
Yes ... I got the money.
Is it?
That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying?
Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time.
You do it.
Why me?
I figured that out.
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
He wants money.
Pay him.
No, sir.
I thought the gloves were off.
Well, no place where they speak English.  That way he can always say he was misquoted.
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
... go on.
'Night, Al.
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
Cox!  Fire him.
Can we get around this, Al?
It's the Supreme Court, sir; you don't get around it.
Lincoln used it.
That was civil war.
How do you see this?
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
That fruitcake!  What about him?
We were working on China.
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
You never told him?
Sir?
Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
This could be it ... this could be it. Four long years ...
Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
We could leverage Helms.
How?
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
Townsend gave us 300 grand.  Belgium's not worth more than 100, 150 ...
No ...
Why me?
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
Is it my turn?
Thou must.
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
Harold ... can I get you anything?
Not if I give you all the cards ...
The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
Mr. Castro.
Yes.
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
So President Kennedy thought.
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
Winning?
I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
I never met the man.
Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
The White House.
I won't tell him if you won't.
Presidents don't threaten.  They don't have to.  Good day, gentlemen.
But they all got it back again, didn't they?  We should have lunch sometime.
Jews and Negros don't win elections, Henry.  Better to hang them around the Democrats' necks.
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
Idiotic?  Yes, I suppose it was.
Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
Don't be too proud; never be too proud to go on your knees before God.
What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing.
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
Of course.
Yes, Mr. President.
That was Mr. Kennedy.
You don't think he was a hero?
Did you cry when he died?
Why?
I was the lesser of two evils.
The real war is in us.  History is a symptom of our disease.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
I came down here to close a deal for Studebaker.
When they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you!
What the hell -- I love her.  And she's great in bed.
Don't worry -- I'll use the old Nixon charm on her.
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
That was a long time ago.
... but it was all we had.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
You're shittin' me.
Where you from?
Hello ...
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Elvis I like, too.
Oh yeah, he's good.
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
Then what's the point?  What's the point of being president?  You're powerless.
And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!
Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
POWs.  And their families.
So I'm supposed to be ...
Compassionate.  Grateful.
Sir?
Of them.
Yes, yes.
Fire him.
... and get rid of all these "goddamns" and "Jesus Christs"!
I know ...
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
It's over, Dick.
I'll concede in the morning.
Not that.  Us.
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
Are you serious?
Yeah ... I'm out.
Is that the truth?
I'll never run again.  I promise.
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
You don't have to go.
They've lost a brother.  You know what that means, Dick.
We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
I don't want them to love me.
Do you really want this, Dick?
This.  Above all.
And then you'll be happy?
Are you okay?
Yes, it's been a long time ...
Then what are you scared of, honey?
Yes!
When?
Tomorrow.
You.  What' you're doing --
And what am I doing?
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
Hiding what?
Brezhnev's coming in three days.  I don't want to deal with them.  And him.  And you.
What matters to me is whether you understand it.
Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy.
Lost.
Someday, Dick.
What?
The "crises"?
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
Who else'd be in your truck.
How's that?
I deduced it. Once you walked in.
She just told me you was quittin'. Sit down.
'Predate it.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
How come're you doin that?
I don't know. I feel overmatched.
Yes I do.
Nineteen zero and nine.
You're discouraged.
I'm... discouraged.
No ID in her room?
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
Try "old" on for size.
Well what would you call him.
Oh yes.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
No I ain't.
Nothin'?
Would you tell me if you had?
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
It's not me he's in trouble with.
Who's he in trouble with then?
Some pretty bad people.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
I don't know. My mind wanders.
No.
The old boy shot by the highway?
You sure?
You figure him for a dope runner?
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.
No. Probably I don't.
It's a mess, ain't it Sheriff?
Gun out and up.
I'm hidin' behind you.
Believe you're right.
That from the lock?
So when was he here?
I don't know. Oh.
Sheriff?
I'm ahead of you there.
Wasn't no bullet.
Yessir. Wasn't none.
Well I don't either!
Yessir. It was punched out.
Okay.
You gonna drive out there?
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
Yes I do. You don't want to lie without what it's absolutely necessary.
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
That's very nice.
I always am.
Don't get hurt.
I never do.
Don't hurt no one.
Well. If you say so.
Okay.
What do you think.
I can't plan your day.
I mean, would you care to join me.
Lord no. I'm not retired.
I don't know. Had dreams.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
Well they always is to the party concerned.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
Well I didn't see it.
I ain't got the money.
No.
...I need to sit down.
No. But I gave my word.
To your husband.
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
It's full a money.
That'll be the day.
At the gettin' place.
No. I found it.
Llewelyn!
What? Quit hollerin'.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
I need to know that.
Just keep it up.
Yeah.
What're you doin', baby?
Goin' out.
Goin' where?
What're you goin' to do?
Well then I'll tell her myself.
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
Well -- how come?
Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
Yes I do.
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
Uh-huh.
You should be used to that.
Yes ma'am?
You are comin back, ain't ya?
Hey.
What should I do?
You know what's goin' on?
I can hear it in your voice.
She'll be all right?
I know where the money is.
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
What's that.
And where is that.
You mean the nature of this conversation?
I mean the nature of you.
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Did you go up to his trailer?
Yes I did.
I can't say.
Where does he work?
Is Llewelyn there?
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
You expect him?
Step out of the car please, sir.
In the truck.  I'll get it.
Not a bleep.
All right...
No me mate.
You from around here?
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
Airport.
Well -- where ya goin'?
I don't need to talk to you.
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
Why would I care where you're going.
Do you know where I'm going?
Yeah? Where am I?
All right.
You know she won't be there.
So what're you goin' up there for.
Yes.
Nobody. Accounting.
That's foolish. You pick the one right tool.
Sixty-nine cent.
This. And the gas.
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
What way would that be?
I seen you was from Dallas.
Didn't mean nothin'.
I was just passin' the time.
I don't know. Will there?
With what?
With anything?
You already asked me that.
Well... I need to see about closin'.
Yessir.
What time do you close?
Now. We close now.
I could come back then.
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
You live in that house behind the store?
You've lived here all your life?
You married into it.
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
I don't know. I couldn't say.
Call it?
For what?
Just call it.
How's that?
All right. Heads then.
...Where you want me to put it?
They'll give you a wallop.
Uh-huh.
Somethin' like that.
What kind of tent?
The kind with the most poles.
That's twenty-six dollars.
You on all night?
Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.
Okay.
I want you to take me to another motel.
Let's just call it square.
When did you last see him.
November the 28th, last year.
Well enough.
That's not an answer.
Yes?
I'm sorry.
Goodbye, Mr. Wells.
The what?
The option.
I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.
You want to change rooms?
That's got two double beds.
I got beers in my room.
What else then?
Lookin' for what's comin'.
I do like you.
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
How would you describe him?
I know how he found me.
Not any way.
Took me about three hours.
I been immobile.
I'm retired.
What did you do?
I'm a welder.
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
Yes.
I don't mean braze.
I didn't say braze.
Pot metal?
What did I say?
Were you in Nam?
Yeah. I was in Nam.
So was I.
To kill your wife.
The heroin. You don't have it.
No I don't have it.
No. You don't.
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
That is correct. And how do I decide?
Are you jackin' with me?
No sir.
Don't jack with me.
Are you in the service?
No sir. I'm a veteran.
Nam?
Yes sir. Two tours.
What outfit.
Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW! GOODBYE!
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
You should get the order you want.
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
Did you send anyone out there?
Anyway, so what?
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
A woman can write a check.
Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?
Tell him what you told me.
Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
Any idea where it is?
Little place called "Williams," why?
-- small-time, pissant, Barney Fife --
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
No, I was just... How you doing?
Great. Good. Content...
Oh. How come?
You must be joking.
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
...I... I know what you are.
Do you know why I'm here?
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
This is really awkward...
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
The LeSabre!
Maroon.  I stole it.
What?
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
I gotta go make dinner.
Are you and Larry happy?
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
I gotta go.
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
We were engaged.
I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
You're late, Eric.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
I ran back in to get the phone.
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
Or the vitamins? Or the...?
...well, then you ain't got much.
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to...
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
Uh-huh.
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
It was Chloe...
Roy! What are you doing here?
You're in serious danger!
He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
Los Angeles, California.
No. Loma Vista.
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
What's his real name?
Dr. David Ravell.
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.
Worse.
You made out alright.
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer.
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
...did I win some contest?
He has no heartbeat!
You're hurting him!!
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
So why'd you come to L.A.?
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
The one you were telling me about?
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
I was talking about what you could wear!
Who?
Doctor David Ravell.
What? Where was he?!
ON TELEVISION!!  Cut the shit, will you!
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
You never know who you'll see.
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
You still in love?
He is real.
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that.
Where are you going?
I have to leave now.
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
No, that should be more than --
Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.
You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.
You don't exactly look like drug dealers.
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
...and put them in your mouth.
Beer, please.
Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
You told me how to do it!
We don't know which Buick, do we?
Well, why'd you shoot him?
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him.
Should I kill him now?
Wait. Any last words, General Lee?
You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...
So what the fuck's a Finn?
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
What?
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
I don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it.
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
I'm not telling.
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
Well... I think I saw her soul.
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
You need to remember who you're talking to...
A doctor on the show... why?
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
I said 'got it?'
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
No, I said to follow 'my' instincts. Now, we go up there and conclude our business. Case closed.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
Oh, five years, give or take.
Hmm... you two in high school together?
It is, if you like idiots...
You better believe it.
He's waiting...
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
Can I have an evil twin?
No! Let me try this!
Yeah? The sport utility?
Uh-huh.
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
Yeah. Why, you know him?
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
She's a lesbian.
I swear to God!
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
"A Reason to Love."
Mr. Campbell?
Huh?
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
- and share one of your graves.
Gopher, Everett?
You mis'able little sneak thief...
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!
Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
Do not seek the treasure!
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
Good Lord, what do we do?
Fire! I hate fire!
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
Four hundred, Delmar.
Izzat right?
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
Oh my God!
He was never turned into a frog!
Everett, my beard itches.
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
Assa good idea, Pappy.
Campaign manager? Waldrip.
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
In any state.
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Suckin' away.
Helluva awgazation.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Pullin' ah pants down...
Wipin' little circles with his bread...
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
Vernon T. Waldrip.
Not out the other side his face, though.
Oh no, no, just the reg'la side -
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
It's just a symbol, honey -
No weddin'.
- in the gods - Huh?
That's not my ring.
Not your...
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
Well, we need that ring.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
Yes, but honey -
That wasn't my doing...
Well sure, honey, but...
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
The hell you say! Wash is kin!
Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
You didn't know that at the time!
So I borrowed it till I did know!
That don't make no sense!
Million point two.
Well that hardly sounds like you...
Isn't it, uh...
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.
I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
I am. Hur you?
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
We ain't got a constichency! Stokes got a constichency!
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
Well I guess folks don't mind they's integrated.
He ain't our daddy!
You got a maiden name, Daddy?
He's a suitor!
Buyin' nipples!
Yes, Sir.
Well, that's how long I've been out at sea.
What for?
Okay, okay. You win.
Thank you, sir!
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Wha-chu-say, palequero? Short time, long time, only ten dolla.
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
Nobody. It just came to me.
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
Hey, Zackie -- don't go away mad.
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
When did this happen?
A long time ago.
I don't mean anything by it.
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
Get into your fatigues, Mayo. Before the weekend's out, you'll quit.
That's a lie, Mayo. You've gone through a lot worse, haven't you?
Sell it to the Air Force, Mayo!
Why? Because you can do it alone?
Pity you don't have the character.
Yes, sir!
Maybe there's hope for you yet.
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
Well, goodbye.
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
How're you doing, Sarge?
Pardon?
I called you Sarge.
Before that.
No, sir!
No, sir.
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
No, sir!
Where are you from, boy?
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Zack, don't!
Louder!
Yes, sir!!
He was. He died.
Vietnam?
Yeah.
We don't have to talk at all.
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
Or we could do that yeah.
Then, I'll see you around.
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
What?
One more minute.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
Come on. Let's go dance.
I got my foot on the floor.
But in what ways?
I haven't made up my mind.
I do.
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
No, and I'm not looking for one either.
Yeah? Why're you here?
My kinda group!
He didn't give you much choice.
There's always a choice.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
Any time, sailor.
It sure was.
I'll get it if you want.
I don't want you to move.
They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Hey, will you just leave me alone?
No, they're for your mom.
Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas.
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
Your real father?
So?
Why'd he do it?
I don't know where that is.
Because he's my friend, too.
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart.
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
Sure.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
Do you know that for sure?
It's mine.
Not with me.  Not with people.
Peace out.
She didn't.
Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
The fuck did you do that for?!
That's right.
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
Yes.
Remember that.
Please...
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
This is ridiculous...
Two.  Squeeze harder.
I can't just...
Th --
Okay, okay!  Okay.
You got an idea?
Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
She better.
NOT THAT ONE?!
She's got your gun, that's what she's thinking!  The FUCK you had to bring a gun for?!
FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
Keep your voice down.
They're not supposed to be here!
This was your department, Junior.
They're not supposed to be here!
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
Fourteen business days.  Escrow is always business days.
You're an idiot.
This is insane.  I'm outta here.
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
So we keep an eye on her.  Raoul can totally administrate that part.
Raoul, what in God's name do we do if she has a gun?
I did.
They're gonna die in there!
Shit!
Hey.
And we're never getting in.
Jesus, what was I thinking?
I mean it!
Adios.
Everything okay?
Huh?
Can we come in?
What do you want?
We'd like to come in.
No, you can't come in.
You don't look so good.
Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!
Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
Not at all.
I said open the door.
It's okay, Raoul.
No fucking way.
The hell we are.
Nobody leaves.
Observe.
How many more do we have after this?
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
What?
Why?
Ever read any Poe?
The furniture guy?
Got us in here, didn't I?
Shoulda got an apartment.
Well, I know that now.
478...
0150.
Don't.
Fuck her too.
People.  In the house.
That room!
What?!
PANIC ROOM!
It doesn't work?!
What do they want?
I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
Wait.
Feel okay?
Yeah.
Shaky?
Nope.
Chills?
Huh uh.
They're coming in here, aren't they?
No, I told you, they can't.  It's not a possibility.
Fuck.
Get the fuck out of my house!
Give me a break.
Little bit.  Yeah.
Don't though. 
What am I, a five year old?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
I don't know, why?
To prove he wasn't chicken.
YOU HAVE TO!
I'm here.  I'm here.
On the floor!  Get on the floor!
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
Come on, come on...
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
On it!
Uh uh.
He WILL.
I'm sorry.
Why?
I'm dizzy and thirsty.
Not an option.
Oh shit Alma... you're...
Fuck that, we've got company...
What are doing with yours?.
I tell you "officer", it wasn't...
Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.
Damn straight...  Let's go check out these Paper Panthers.
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
Yeah, I do, but he's gotta cool it...
Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
Sure, those boojie jokers don't do anything except print up a lotta paper saying "Black is Beautiful."
Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
Yeah you do. It's up to you either here or downtown.
What's with you?
Get out of the fucking car.
Yeah, it's me.
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
You know it. Stay Black...
No Fuck you!!!
Look this is bull...
Party needs the bread.  Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!
No man. PE -- "political education."
Not yet, one of these day's maybe. Bobby's party chairman. Political Education's really his bag.
Cy... I ain't even sure.
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
Naw... I gotta...
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
Yes sir, I did.
Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
Yeah... Bobby you gotta...
Alone...
Yeah.
So what's the deal?
Yeah... let me think about it.
Right on Brother Judge...
Brimmer.
Well, act like it. Come on.
What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
Fuck maybe... be there.
Anything happens to Huey it ain't gonna be a finger. I'll...
Nothing.
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
Later for that. I'm done either way...
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Where is he?.
Ain't no one seen him.
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
You don't even know it man, but you're a god damn hero.
Yeah... cop hit me...
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
I don't know. I really don't.
It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
Good.
Late summer.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
It's a start.
That would be nice.
I expect to try.
Pride will do.
The hell I do.
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
As do you.
Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed.
I said, I'm not my sister.
I know that.
Do you?
Of course, I do.
Very well, then.
Goodbye.
Yes, sir.
What unit?
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
Who cared for your wounds?
With a lace table cloth?
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
As you wish.
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
I consider them linked.
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
Sir.
Perhaps.
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
When I have children, I hope I don't hide behind them.
Not yet.  What happened?
You're in no condition to ride.
It's safer if we stay together.
Yes, sir.  My father taught me.
He tried.  It didn't take.
Yes...  ... father.
You know how old I am.
God help us all when you're forty.
I didn't see any.
And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
Pride is his weakness.
She got me at a more impressionable age.
I don't believe it... and I wasn't there for it...
Cheraw Falls.
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
She is.  Don't go in there.
You know what happened.
No, I don't.
And what do they know?
That's not enough.  Tell me.
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
You don't hate him.
Thirteen years...
... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
You said bribery twice...
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
What are my orders?
Long time.
Not held, just slowed down.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
How many men have we seen die?
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
Goodbye, Harry.
Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
Robert.  Robert E. Lee.
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
Four, five miles.
No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads.  We're safer here.
Leave him.  Take care of William and Susan.
Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one of that sort.
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
Earned.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
I've had no sons to lose, nor daughters.  I lose the sons of other men.
Remember Braddock?
That bad?
Worse.
When?
But father, they might come this way.
Put them away.
Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field?
Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
I'm glad I killed them... I'm glad...
You'll see soon enough, hon.
Ayuh.
It's a place where the dead speak, Missy.
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
Is that right, dad?
In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.
Ellie...Ellie...what...
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.
I will. Come and kiss me.
Yaay!
Yayyy!
For a little while.
Yes.
Because you promised.
I know.
No more chocolate chip cookies.
Huh?
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
Oh, faith's a little more than just believing.
I'm sure you're not.
Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance.
Not at all.
Good for you.
Allman Brothers.
What?
Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
I don't know.
Does she love the cat?
Yes, but--
Then come on.
You'll see before long. Let's go.
You keep saying that.
This time I mean it.
Whose burying ground?
Don't worry about that.
Jud, why am I doing all this?
Because it's right.
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
Well...a touch of the flu...
It's Ellie's cat.
Nope. He's your cat now.
I'm thinking about going to bed.
Shit! Look at this mess!
Ayuh--it's a mess, all right.
And because the dead walked.
Louis, the house is beautiful.
Come on--let's parole 'em.
Jesus, the road!
Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
It's beautiful!
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
I just said--
I got eggs down here!
Good d--
You're doing fine.
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
I'm sure.
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
That boat is my livelihood!
You'll get it back.  Or one better.
Aye, aye, sir!
She.  Goes.  Free.
You can't.  I can.
Elizabeth goes free!
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
I'm supposed to ... trust you?
Wait as long as you like.
You can go to your grave not knowing.
That so?
Men!  Are you up for it?
Aye, for us there is.
Now.  No, don't kill him.
And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
Thank you, sir.
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
It's a pirate medallion.
Boy overboard!
I'm a bit nervous, myself --
One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
You're speaking up for him again?
That would hardly be proper.
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.
Women in London must have learned to not breathe.
About the day we met. Do you remember?
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.
Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
-- then we never would have met.
I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
Me!
You're in league with Barbossa!
What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
To the Black Pearl.
Nor did you, I noticed.
She can hold a bit longer.
Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
I know.  That was for the smell.
That we are.
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
I don't think that will be necessary.
Sorry, I didn't know.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
Smith.
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
I knew you'd listen to reason!
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
Only a little.
No.
Move!
Where does it make berth?
Because you're a pirate.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
Never.  They took Miss Swann.
How?  The key's run off.
Agreed!
We need to go!
Good.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
My father.  William Turner?
I swear, you look just like him.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
My father -- was not -- a pirate!
Don't worry.  I've already got a Quartermaster -- there!
Depends.
On what?
I'll lead them away.
It's the right way.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
No, it's not.
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
You've seen it?
Yes.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
Yes.
You haven't seen it.
Yes, I have.
No.
He may be.
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
Where did he come from?
But --
Please.
Dr. Bright has escaped.
Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation.
You don't have to give it to us because Dr. Nebbleman can just cut it out of him.
Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.
You're lacking a few things too: ethics, morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant.
Ain't it.
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
You think you can use me to stop the meltdown.
That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
You're not rotting meat.
She says it's not.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
She let it escape because she wants me to die.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
No, Icky, this is real.
Icarus, please!  This is important!
Then you still love me?
I'm so excited, Icarus.
What I asked you earlier?
Poppy, this is not the time!
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them.
The trunk.
Excellent.  How long until the assembler tank is complete?
In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do.
You don't want this.
Yeah, I do!
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
I'll do whatever I have to do.
Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
Well, you got another problem.
The replicators?
This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
You're looking for a urine sample.
No!  Well, not those exact words.
Who isn't?
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
Like Crazy Glue?
So, I guess it worked.
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
Been out for six months now.
Really?  What have you been doing?
You know, this and that.
Same old Daniel.
The big house.
A cage by any other name would still smell like sweaty ugly men.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
Right.  You predicted it.
That's what I thought.
We'll see?  What does that mean?
Susan, this is the future of America here.
Daniel, what are you doing here?
Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
No, something is really wrong... look!
The nanobot.
Mouse?  What mouse?
What happened to it?
I don't know.
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
We don't?
Three days ago it was.
What do these replicators do to people?
With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.
Isn't it already too late then?
No, no, I just feel wired!
What?  What's wrong?
What about it!
Just giving credit where credit is due.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!
I'm glad you came to me for help.
Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
The nanobot... it's not here...
It's still inside me?
I don't know.
Something else I want to try.
Getting used to it.
Like a glove.
On the counter.
The head shrinker at the prison.
Argon's private lab.
Let's go.
I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
Did you think I could just leave you...?
We've got to get the nanobot.
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
You mean he's polymerized, like me?
God, what a fight that was.
We were different people then.
I guess they do.
Oh yes you are!
Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
Yeah, and what might that be?
An ass-beating.  Would you like yours first, Mr. Sim?
It's a miracle.
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
And you have him?
We lost him.
You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
Don't worry, four eyes.
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
You don't seem to understand that this one's different. He has brains.
Yes - isn't it.
Goodbye, Stew
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
Certainly. Right over there.
You're all right.
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
No - give you another guess.
For what?
For the letters, of course.
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
Of course I am Stewart.
Now let's get this settled
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live
Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
Yes - isn't it?
You did? That's a lot of hooey! I'll go and apologize.
What are you talking about?
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
Good morning. What does this mean?
Oh, hello Mother!
Mother!
Look! Look! The front page!
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening
Yeah, hello. How are you?
Thanks, I will.
Oh, man!
Well, I should say!
I knew your managing editor very well.
Is that so?
Yale '21, I believe.
Huh?
We were classmates.
As one Tribune man to another
All right, all right, don't mention it.
Give my regards to your managing editor.
I certainly will.
Hey, make up your mind, will you?
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
Yeah, little Gloria.
Well - it's only April.
Come on, get going, get going!
No? Well, where were you when that happened?
Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
That's so.
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
Sure.
Araby, my eye!
No?
No!
Your valet, sir.
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
I beg your pardon, sir?
Outside!
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
Yes, of course. I'll get it for you
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
and those and them.
And the rest of us are truck horses?
There you go, talking like a woman!
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
I hope you'll be very happy.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
How is her family going to feel about it?
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
My mistake - she's glaring.
Hello, Stew.
Hello, Hank. How are you?
Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
To Old Madrid.
Never even been to New Madrid.
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Did Conrad draw on his imagination?
Conrad.
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
Yeah?
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
What did he want?
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
I have it here.
You quit trying to stop anybody
Well, at best you might deny it.
Holy jumping swordfish!
I suppose you know why I came?
Now don't be absurd, Smith  May I come in?
Thanks. May I sit down?
You don't.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
Okay - you remember Joe
Sure.
Hello, Joe.
Double strength!
"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"
They've been ready for the last half hour.
I have. Double-strength!
Get out of here.
All right, Grandma
Yes - the worm!
I beg your pardon?
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
Heavens! The man's insane!
I understand, sir.
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
You try it.
Me, sir?
Yeah.
Found no skeletons?
No, sir.
It's haunted just the same.
Yes, sir.
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
Yeah?
What do you mean?
It doesn't matter.
No. I want to know.
Ah.
Okay.
What?
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
I'm fine.
In my handbag.
Looks just like it did.
And they won't be able to tell?
No ... They won't be able to tell.
What?
Sure.
I had to say goodbye.
Thanks ... I love you.
I love you too.
Hello Bill.
I'm sorry ...
No, no ... Come on in.
Thanks.
I think it looks nice.
Well ...  Here's what it's s'posed to look like.
Bud brought it to me.
Bud?
Here's my favorite.
She's crying.
No she's not.
Yes she is.
I've got to go ...
No ...
I don't know.
Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
All night?
Sure you are.
No I'm not.
It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
I don't want to put on some make up ...
I don't want it to go away.
I'm gonna go now.
Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
Oh yeah.
But where would we go?
... Lover's Lane.
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
It is?
Trust me ...
What are you doing?
It's six-thirty ...
So.
We were gonna ... You know ...
Why not?
With what?
It's better, Mary Sue.
I don't believe it.
What's the matter?
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
But it could happen.
Oh, no thanks ...
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
Real rain?
Yes I did.
Yes I do.
The basketball team?
You're not allowed to lie.
I'm not lying ... Here I'll show you.
Why am I out of order?
Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
Oh sure it is.
Well, I never had to do it before.
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
What is it?
Hello Mr. Simpson.
Yes.
The other one?
What are you doing?
Yeah. Every episode ever.
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It doesn't work without a remote.
YOU get lost!
What happened?
I'm not sure.
I don't know.
What's going to happen?
Neither do I.
Just take deep breaths.
We're supposed to be in school.
Owns the hardware store.
To who?
As a matter of fact he does.
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
Can we do any better?
I don't think so.
I got lost.  Oh here ... look at this!
He won't notice anyway.
What do you mean?
They don't notice that kind of thing.
So what's the point?
Jen please ...
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
Well if I don't who will?
They're happy like this.
Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
Really? It seems so fattening.
Not directly anyhow ...
It's fine.
Nothing.
Nothing?
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
I told you. I'm like positive.
This thing works. We could go home right now.
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
Right here.
And you're sure about this?
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
No. I baked them for you.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
No. I baked them for you.
Oh ... Hi.
... Lover's Lane?
You don't know?
What?
Out there.
What's that like?
Mmmm.  Boy. It's hot up here.
Hunh?
Rain.
Real rain?
Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
We'll just put up the top.
It was a prop for the school play ...
Sure ...
I'm not sure.
No I won't. I swear.
I like it too.
Marmalade.
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
Well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?
... Like Prince Charming.
Nice ... Nice ...
McGinty's.
Because we don't belong!
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
... Hi.
What?
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
Oh--well ...
NOW!
I didn't do anything wrong.
Oh no? Let me show you something!
EXCUSE ME?
JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!
I'm going to leave now.
I'm sorry. I can't do that.
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
Much less than that.  An hour and a half.
This is TV pal. They don't fool around.
I understand.
What?
... Yeah.
Have you cooked the burgers?
Yes.
Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early.
Yeah ...
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
Oh ... Okay.  ... But I really liked it.
... What's that?
Christmastime.
Yeah.
Hi.
Aren't you a little early?
I brought you something ... From the library.
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
Open it.
Yeah. TV busted?
Yeah ...
Well here I am.
A miracle.
Yeah ... Saw you too.
Cool.
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
Yeah but what are you doing?
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
So you can't talk to me?
Well, I can't talk though --
And what was this?
Somewhere in Utah.
What's the listing?
D&D Mattress Man.
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
So you're coming tonight, right?
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
I don't think I'm going to the party.
So it's ok if I bring her.
...please, I just don't want it....
I'm trying to be your friend.
I know.
Did I say that?
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
You look nervous.
I'm not, I'm very happy.
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
It's fine, but --
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
I feel really on the spot now.
Are you gonna do it?
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
You're being weird again, see. Come on. Please don't be weird.
It's not mine.
Why's it here?
I have no idea.
Call me later.
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
I just want to know where she's staying.
Hi, is this Jack?
Yes.
This is Georgia.
Hi. This is Jack.
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
I'm in my bedroom.
Are you watching a porno movie?
Do you like porno movies?
Sure.
...just talking to you....
No.
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
Yeah....you're married aren't you, Jack?
You have a girlfriend?
...yes...
Where is she?
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
...yeah....well you have me now.
You sound very cute, very nice.
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
I'm fine. Who is this?
Georgia.
Hi....what....what's up....?
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
You don't even know how much it is.
I know but I....how much is it?
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
You have trouble, financial trouble?
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.
I thought you had your own business. You said you were gonna diversify and all that stuff....
No. I'm sorry.
We got disconnected before....
I need help.
-- you said you did.
I know I did. But I don't.
You lied to me?
I didn't lie.
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
No you won't.
It was cool last night.
Are you telling me no?
They're not open yet?
They don't get opened until eight.
Do you know them.
Not very well.
Hi.
Yeah, not really.
I saw a picture of you.
No. I'm the exact opposite --
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
Yeah.
Alright?
....Hi.....
....Hi.....
It's Barry.
About six months.
You like her?
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
You were talking about the promotion --
You see?
Yeah, no, I see --
So that was your pudding?
....No....
No I didn't say that.
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Yes.
What happened?
Nothing.
What did he want?
Nothing.
Did something happen; are you alright?
Did you pick it up from the street?
Are you learning how to play it?
Yes? I'm trying.
Oh that's great.
...yeah...
If you come to Hawaii --
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
You don't think you'll go --
I don't know.
This is Lena.
Hi.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ok.
What do you mean?
...I don't know what you mean....
I don't freak out.
Thank you.
Yeah?
It's Barry.
I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
I just wanted to make sure.
yeah.
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
It's so nice.
This really looks like Hawaii here.
Yeah.
What's that? What is that that you're doing?
Yeah.
This is nice.
For what?
For work.....
I think maybe over a hundred.
That's right you travel so much.
It's ok to ask that.
I thought that you were anyway.
I'm fine are you ok?
Yes I'm sorry.
What is this?
Let's go to the hospital.
I'm sorry.
You can't do that.
Ok.
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
I'm fine, I have your work number.
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
Ok, bye, bye.
Bye.
Did you do it?
No.
Well who did?
You're hand is bleeding.
I cut myself.
How?
On my knife.
Why? ...what?
Your hand is bleeding.
I know.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
Please don't do this to me.
The police are on their way.
Hi, is this your first time calling?
Yes it is.
What do you mean?
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
And your name?
Barry Egan.
And your Social Security number.
It's ok, take your time.
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
No one will know your name.
Can you say that my name is Jack?
You want her to call you Jack?
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
Thank you.
I think you have a call?
I didn't know you had a sister?
Hi Walter.
How's business?
Maybe you said that because you're hungry.....
Well I'm sorry. Before...
Ok. You're connected.
No, no, no, no, nO, NO, NO!
Hey...Lance....can I.....
Yes I'm fine.
Why you wearin' a suit?
That's not a piano.....I have a piano at home.....where'd you get it?
...it just....I don't know....I don't know.
Hi, Lance.
No thanks.
...I'll tell you later.
....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
That's funny.
Hi.
How much money do you have in your pockets?
Just take it, take the money in my pockets, take it, it's fine --
What do you have in the house?
Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have....
Yes.
Is this where you live?
Yes.
Are you serious with this?
Yes. Sorry.
Well....what do you want, then?
I'm sorry, I know. I know that it's....
What are you doing?
Are you going to the party tonight?
Yes I am.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Right now, you're doing nothing?
What time are you gonna be there?
You can't be late.
I won't.
I'm serious.
I know.
Seriously.
Ok.
You can't be late though.
I know.
I know.
Yeah but I'm serious.
Ok.
I'll see you there.
Don't puss out.
I won't.
When can you leave?
As soon as you want.
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
That's it.
I'm only paying two of you guys.
What's the problem?
Nothing.
Put him through.
Shut up, just put him on the phone, it doesn't matter, just shut up --
Are you sure?
Just tell him to call me.
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
I'm sorry. You're right.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
Should I call you later?
I'll just see you when you get back here.
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
We've still a few lone incurables. Prone to violence, to perversion.
No one's forcing you to listen.
Once or twice.
Then what's he doing here?
I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
"...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."
Yes, Abbe?
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
"Turn you out?"
Mother's not half so blind as you.
What? What've I done?
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
Mustn't do that, sir.
I must grant him his last rites.
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
You'd deny a dying man his salvation?
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
Mightier than the sword indeed.
Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
You always do.
THEN BUGGER ME!
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
Because your writing continues, unchecked.
What on earth would that require?
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
Coulmier, you animal!
I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
Your words drove Bouchon to --
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
I saw the longing in your eye --
-- that was lust --
-- the passion in your heart --
I know, because I felt it myself --
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
AND DID YOU?
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
Who's to say I did not?
Was it impotence?
NEVER!
I'm here.
It's a formality; truly.
Well...?
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
He's sworn to obedience.
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
Of course.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
No. It most certainly was not.
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
You'd suffer in her stead?
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
Poorly.
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
Do you know how I define "idealism," Monsieur Delben?
Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rou!
Was ever a man more risqu? He wants to take me every way!
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
I'll fill every slippery hollow; if you're obliging, then you'll swallow!
Come now, darling, give it a read.
"Well worth the dig!"
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
Don't start --
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
There's something else I want from you.
I've just the story... inspired by these very surroundings....
Fiendishly so.
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
Oh, you. You talk same as you write.
You demand a lot from your readers, you do.
It's only been described to me. In your books.
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
You could whisper it through the walls of your cell.
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
No. But tell him I would.
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
My schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
What thought is that?
-- words alone are insufficient.
....shame on you, truly...
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
But it's just begun --
Do as I say.
Very much.
You prefer a book to your husband's company?
No, when I was but a tender lad--
Last week would this be?
Not you too
You're just scared.
Am I?
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
Don't insult me with your cute press quotes Save it for Louella.
You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
With about twenty of his spies on my tail. No thanks.
Sure you can, just--
He needs me here.
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
But I am That's the killer, honey.
My name is Orson Welles
The actor
And director.
Randolph!
Oh, why is that?
Why is that, Louis?
There's no call for that language-
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
It's not really--
How much?
Yes.
I am not that woman.
There's nothing to explain
There is nothing to discuss-
You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
You needn't use that language with me
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
There's a different between want and
Not for me.
You will not walk out on me
You are repellant when you drink.
You are slovenly and unattractive and I won't  t-t-t-tolerate it.
I will not have this in my home.
I just want to understand--
Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
Please be quiet.
And how do you feel when you are lied to?
I can't remember the lines!
Then make them up! You're drunk and you're angry.
love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "
No -- no -- I mean--
That's right
Uh-huh
You are talking to him.
Forget it-
What are movies about?
Telling stories.
Nope.
Showing life
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
But with compassion and insight--
Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
Who the hell's Manolete?
The great Spanish bullfighter
I don't wanna write about no spic.
The old man has his own way of doing things
Orson, please ... it's too bright
Please don't say this.
Mank-
Fuck you
I expected more from you.
Fuck you--
She was . . . innocent
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
It is 350 pages of ... ABSOLUTE INSPIRATION!
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
But it's not a great syllable
I just can't . . see it anymore
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
I don't care.
I don't give a shit about-
Jews. She's talking about Jews.
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
George...
Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
Of course, of course. How can we be of service?
That's for me to decide.
You're going to destroy it
Yes
You talked to Mr. Swanbeck?
Get out
CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
It's the safe bet, Orson. There's nothing wrong with that.
Ah, it's a grand title.
They've all seen a rough cut
When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray.
Well it' s all you've got !
No, we're jake. But listen-
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.
I don't want to sit
It was the best, kid
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
Without me. I'm afraid. I got the axe this morning.
Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
I know what you want but it can't be done!
We done?
Yeah.
He's Christ?
I'm Christ
Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
We're from...
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
All right, you guys, shake hands.
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
It's not done.
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
None of your fuckin' business.
Where's your wife, Jake?
What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
Yeah. Do me a favor.
Sure. What is it?
Hit me in the face.
You want me to do what?
You heard me, I said hit me.
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
Here's your glove.
Jack! Enough!
Go ahead.
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
Whadda you care?
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
You wasn't with her, were you?
You wasn't with her?
With her? How?
You know, like bang her or anything?
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna get outa here tonight.
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
How many times do I have to hit her? I hit her enough.
Give me a chance. Let me look.
Say what you're gonna say.
You want the title shot or not?
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
G'wan, do it.  Protect yourself, rummy.
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
Where you been?
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
No, I just told you what happened.
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
What?
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
What?
What do you mean, "you"?
So what?
Did you ever fuck my wife?
Whatsa matter with you?
Maybe it wasn't you, but you know what I'm talkin' about.
Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
What time is it?
Nine o'clock.
At night?
Yeah. At night.
How many pounds I gotta lose?
Three more, I figure.
Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Just give it a nice little tap.
Can you see it?
No.
What does that mean?
That's all right. He don't mind.
It's OK.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
Jake...
Do what I say.
Oh, Jake.
What do you mean, "good looking?"
But, Jake, I was just...
Who asked you?
I was just...
Who asked you?
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
You're not interested in him?
No, I'm not.
What?
You asleep?
Yeah.
Huh?
Yeah, what?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
That he's got a pretty face.
I never noticed his face.
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
I took the kids to my sister's.
I called. You weren't there.
I went to the movies.
What'd you see?
"Father of the Bride."
What was it about?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
You're a fuckin' liar.
Yeah, I sucked his cock.
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
Then what?
I don't know.
Why don't you just call him?
I dunno.
Ok, all right. Telephone's in the hall. Dial his number.
Sure, what else is new?
No. Open the door.
All right, just don't make any noise.
Don't make no difference no more.
Can't you get the money from your friends?
Jake, sit down for a minute.
Never felt better.
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
He should.
Yeah, the weight's Ok.
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
Right, the gym.
I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
Oh. When are they expected home?
He has it. Thank you.
Goodnight.
I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
Name me a better photographer.
But his leg!
Don't worry -- it comes off today.
Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
His wife took a trip.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
She never left the apartment --
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
What time?
Six ayem.
Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
Not yet.
The Thorwalds -- at six in the morning?
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
Your logic is backward.
This is Doyle, Jeff.
Tom, I've got something real big for you.
Your Lisa?
Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
Congratulations, Jeff.
For what?
For getting rid of that cast.
Who said I was getting rid of it?
With that cast on -- you don't.
You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
Next time, have some good news.
Gunnison?
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
It's me.
Something wrong?
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
Did you get my note?
Who are you?
Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
Well, I only quote from the best.
How?
You've got a hormone deficiency.
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
That's normal.
I don't want to.
That's abnormal.
I'm not ready for marriage.
She's only perfect.
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
Intelligence! Nothing has caused the human race more trouble. Modern marriage!
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
And some man will lose his.
He and his wife splitting up?
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
But it takes a particularly low type of man to do it.
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
In this heat?  They're up now.
Get back there! He'll see you!
Huh?
You called the police?
I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
I have a feeling we've just begun.
What?
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
Got a shovel?
No.
Now wait a minute --
There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
Smart? She'll be arrested!
That'll get her out of there, won't it?
To bail Lisa out of jail.
How much do you think you'll need?
First offense burglary --  -- probably two-fifty.  The piggy bank.
Mrs. Doyle?
Yes.
Not yet, Jeff.
You haven't even heard from him?
Not a word.
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
And your stomach?
Empty as a football.
Not too active.
Anything else bothering you?
Uh-huh.
Only because it's expected of her.
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
Going on right here. It's a big night.
Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.
Tired?
She looked very cool. She had on a mint green --
That's good news.
How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
Make the one you want.
You mean leave the magazine?
Yes.
For what?
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
How can you tell that -- from here?
You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
Right now, it doesn't seem so.
You mean "goodnight."
I mean what I said.
Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
I have one now.
So do I.
Tell me about it.
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
Lisa -- there's something terribly wrong.
Something too frightful to utter.
What is it you're looking for?
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
125 West Ninth Street.
To get on home.
I don't know.
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
It doesn't make sense to me.
What doesn't?
Women aren't that unpredictable.
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
You'll have to clear that through my landlord --
Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --
Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
Staying the night here, uninvited.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Exactly what I had in mind -- along with some brandy.
Who was the trunk addressed to?
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
He's washing down the bathroom walls.
Too close.
Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
L. B. Jefferies.
Phone number?
Chelsea 2-5598.
Two minutes.
A new disease.
Friend of yours?
I'm glad they let you out.
Nobody chickened.
What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
Give me some dirt.
Good luck, Buzz.
What?
You watch too much television.
I'm cute, too.
What?
Chicken?
Who's fighting?  This is the test, man.  It's a crazy game.
Somebody find him a knife.
Know the Millertown bluff?
Jim Stark.
Buzz Gundersen.
Hi.
Glad to meet you.
Okay.
I like you, you know?
We got to do something.  Don't we?
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
Any other entrance?
Down in back.
No--
I think I should go home.
No.  We're going to bring him down.
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
You clean out of your head?  Come on!
Hang loose.  We got all night.
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
You still want to go home, Moose?
Hold it, Jim.
You can't protect me.
You make any sandwiches?
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
Yeah!
Yeah!  Shh!
That's funny!
Yes.
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
Well--
Will you wait a minute?
You don't want me to go.
I don't want to learn that!
Sure.  Sure.
Have some cigars.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
No--thanks, very much, Mr. Stark.
I think I know my son.
Listen--can't you wait till we get home?
I was talking to Jim.
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
What's that pounding?
He's home.  I heard the car.
Look--just relax, will you?
I still think you should go down.
Open it.
No, honey.  No, he's not here.
Yes, sir.
Come with me, John.
I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
In my mother's drawer.
I'll wait for him.
Hi there.
You remember me?
No.  I don't think so--
I'm sorry--I made a mistake.
What?
Jim.  What's yours?
Plato.  It's a nickname.
I just don't want trouble.
He has a knife.
They're still there!
Who knows.  Plato?
What?
What's a chickie-run?
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
No.  It's okay.
O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
Who's that!
It's me!
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
They're looking for you!--
Yeah?
Help me in!
Come out come out wherever you are!
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
Wow!  Well now-there-then!
There's only one key.
We'll take it!
Come on!
I'm what?  What?
Hey!  How 'bout that!
Not lately.
Get away from me!
I'm fine.
Why?
What do you think?
I need it.
They like you.  Okay?
Come on!
Just a guard.
I shot at one of them.
But you didn't hurt anybody.
All right, darling.
It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--
Goodbye, dear.
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
Why should you be the only one.
No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
Do I have to spell it out?
Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
Wash up and go home.
No.
I don't know why--!
And your folks didn't understand?
They never do.
So then you moved?
She eats him alive and he takes it.
What?
If he could--
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
Listen--
Bully for you.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
Now that's true!
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
See, I'm new.
You're really flipped--aren't you.
You going there?
Yeah--why--
Dig the square wardrobe!
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
Goodbye!  See you!
I'm not so bad.
You were looking for me, weren't you?
No--I was just--maybe--
I'm numb.
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
Sure.  Lots of times.
Awful?  No.  It's just lonely. It's the loneliest time.
I felt like it.
Your lips are soft when you kiss.
There's just one thing.  What about--
See, we're very modern.
I bet you hear everything I say!
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
How many rooms do you think there are?
Should we explore?
Hi.
Are you?
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
You smell like baby powder.
I never felt so clean before.
I love you, Jim.  I really mean it.
We have to go back!
No!  I got to find him.
Yes.  My best friend.
What's he like?
Hi.
He hates me.
He hates me.
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
Do you think your father means that?
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
Would you like to go home if we can arrange it?  Did you notify the parents?
You said you'd call my father.
We were romantic then too--
No.  Why?
Hi.
What?
I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
Girls don't love their father? Since when?  Since I got to be sixteen?
Gabriel, what are you doing!
Read a lot about you, Nick.
What are you doing here?!
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
A man of some travels.
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
Don't hurt him...
No, baby. He wants me.
...whoever she is.
Searching for a money man...
That's a book, baby.  That's a book of love.
I've been doing good, though.
What, he should see me help you catch him?
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
We sell children's toys --
Radio said negative five.
Negative five?
Yeah.
Radio said.
No, hey, I like your coat --
Saw me --
No, no, no. Be like you want to be.
What.
Smile.
One more. Smile. One more.
No, c'mon --
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
Tell me again.
Yes it was all you --
Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
Then he shoulda signed his name.
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
Beauty and fragrances.
Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho ho ho.
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
We could live it up and --
Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work.
No, lover. I'll see what you can do.
NICK!
Nick, no --
Nick --
JESUS CHRIST!
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
You're not hearing me here --
Nick, please, it's me --
You told him about Nick's letters.
No, Nick, no --
I love you!
Canada.
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
They're truck drivers.
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
Nick...
Get your own room.
Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
Nick, the ice is --
Get to the bridge!  HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE!
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
Don't say my name...
I love you, Nick...
What?
We'll need one.
I'm almost done.
He says he wants it now.
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
They all are. Football's on.
Keep 'em there for a little while.
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
Yeah. That's love.
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
You shouldn't have.
I'm glad it was me.
What are you talking about?
I never told you my name.
The hell I can't.
I shared his cell!
She says a lot of things.
A girl says she loves you, you say something.
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
What's her middle name?
Samantha.
What'd they call her in college?
What college.
Where'd she drop her cherry?
A station wagon in Canada.
What's her greatest fear?
Her brother.
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
No. It's her brother.
Hey.
The hell you don't.
Five million?
This isn't the Tomahawk.
What the fuck are you talking about.
And I worked there. For a year.
Why not.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
More than you know.
Might as well be.
Don't have Weather Channel in the Mountain, Nick.
At least gimme video poker.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
I'm gonna need some money.
...ttt..tt... two out of three?
Nnn... nothing...
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
NO!
Nick. I been trying to hit you.
You need six.
I'm no threat without a gun.
No, you're not.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.
'Tis the season, convict.
How'd you know my name...
How'd you know my name.
Where is he?! Where is he?!
He's not Nick Mason...
OPEN IT!!!
Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
We're aware of your position.
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
What?
We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations!
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
His lips went next. You ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?
Fuckin' freezing.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
Five years. Since it opened.
How long ago was your makeover?
My what?!
Not with you.
You gotta get someone upstairs.
How do we do that?
Where the hell's Gabriel?
Merlin, I didn't know --
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
Oh, man --
Fuckin, Zookerman --
Hell you haven't.
Three days, man.
Not yet.
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
And some pecan pie.
Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.
Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
Shoulda written, Rudy...
Thought you hate your old man.
Good for you. Protein.
Alamo...

GUARD!!!
Ash... Ashley...

YOU TELL HER!
...be with her...
...for Christmas...
Do what?
Well...sorry...
But... I had a five...
You're hitting for MY cards!
THEY'LL OPEN ONE!
I'M NOT NICK!
Who the hell made this map.
Since when? What the hell is this room?
They changed the layout.
Now where were we?
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
Fine, now.
I'll call somebody.
Who?
No. She was from Ladora Heights.
How do you know all this?
Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
What?
That's okay, Eddie, I do.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
Who, Mr. White?
Yeah.
Me and Mr. White?
Yeah.
What about?
The Brewers.
The Milwaukee Brewers?
Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.
What?
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
What? Snap out of it!
I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me...
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
How is he?
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
Cause you're a faggot, alright?
Dead as Dillinger.
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
You gonna put it away?
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it.
Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya?
Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
What for?
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
Juicy, junior, real juicy.
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
I'm not askin', I'm betting.
Mr. Pink?  Why?
He don't tip.
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
He don't believe in it.
Freddy Newendyke.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
I do.  How do I look?
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
I said: "Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite."
Down to my car.
Why?
It's a surprise.
Nice Guy Eddie.
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
Correct.
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
I don't believe in it.
You don't believe in tipping?
You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
You really think we were set up?
Why not?
What's wrong with it?
No real people?
Uh-uh, just cops.
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
I got the diamonds.
Where?
I got 'em, all right?
Where? Are they out in the car?
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
He ain't dead.
So what is it?
I think he's just passed out.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
Don't fuckin' patronize me.
If we don't, he'll die.
We don't think this place is safe.
What are you gonna do about him?
Yeah, those guys too.
Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
Nobody. The light was bad.
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
And one of 'em is sick.
It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
As far as -- Sonora?
Just about.
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
Where do you keep the can opener?
And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
Go on, there's a good boy.
Yeah.
His letters will keep.
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
We can't stay here!
It's a long walk back to Aspen.
But the rest is right.
That's fine.
It's too light yet.
Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
Maybe it's better that way.
You don't mean that Clay.
What?
I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
That's right -- worry about your clothes --
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
Like I said, I was thinkin' of the horses.
Fine -- maybe I'll see you there sometime.
Goodbye, Mary.
To the other side of the street.
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
So did I. They were in it.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
Which ranch?
How's that?
A little hot.
A man I used to know.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
At the ranch maybe?
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
And meet him there.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
Swimming.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
There's only two of them now.
You better start.
That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
I don't care what she asked you.
Sure. What other reason would there be?
I just wondered. Let's go.
You'll live.
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
I can't take her with me.
Nobody asked you to.
What's there to be fair about?
I can't take her with me.
Nobody asked you to.
What's there to be fair about?
What's botherin' you, anyway?
Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
I'm sorry. Let's go.
That's a good girl.
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
If she says anything to them I'll kill her.
Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
Just a thing I was workin' on.
The way you act, it must be something pretty secret.
You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
Yes, people make me restless.
Even women?
There aren't any women here.
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
Yeah.
Go ahead.
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
I don't like to see you go.
And we're running out of that.
There's still tomorrow morning.
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
We don't want to go there.
He certainly could. About a month.
What are you waiting for? Do something.
How many ways can a man say no.
You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
What's the use.
Maybe you are. I'm not.
Who brought you here?
Where is he?
I don't know -- I don't know.
What for?
He can wait. Let's stay here until morning.
Yeah, we sure have.
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
Lookin' around.
I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
I sure would.
Maybe I could start you out.
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
Good night, Steve.
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
Okay. A-B-C -- D-E-F -- G-H-I --
No. We're not stayin' --
That's the end of the line.
Then I know my alphabet.
What do they look like?
How about California?
Would they be good to eat?
I was doin' both. Here.
Oh, sure.
Let me do that.
If you need me, I'll be --
That's always tough. How long were you together?
I found a picture of his wife.
Do I know you?
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
That's it.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Would you die already?!
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
No, you don't understand. It's here in these statues...
Hey, I have an idea...
It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
He's not dead, you idiot. He lives in Florida. Now, shut up and let me finish.
Hello Ray.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
So, I guess I can go now.
Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
He's so brave.
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
No. I never date outside my race.
I meant you're into ghosts.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Okay. See you later, friend.
Open chest!!!
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Okay.
Shhh!
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
It looks like the furnace.
Let's get outta here.
No. Try a little higher.
No. Keep rubbing.
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this.
I know, but I've been thinking --
Listen to me I --
Listen to me I --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
That's what your man is supposed to do.
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
Yeah.  Can I borrow five bucks?
I don't care. You pick.
Hot dogs.
So, whatever happened to her?
She killed herself a week before he died.
But he'll kill her!
That means more screen time for us.
Oh, right.
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
Yeah, I broke my fall.
I'm Hanson the caretaker.
Thanks. I made them by hand.
No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
Um, I'm not touching anything.
Made you say it!
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
Yes!!!!
We have to destroy him.
My child, you're alive!
Yes, we made it!
We? What do you mean... we?
No, my friends are right here!
Soon, but first I must bless this house.
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
You could use the grade, huh?
Oh.
Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
Hey, I got an idea.
I told you it would taste just like chicken.
Uh, uh.
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
Theo, did you see the animal?
There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.
I wouldn't go that far.
Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
Don't touch me!!
Let me see the files.
They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them.
I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.
Are these all the subjects?
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
How are we going to get them all up there?
Remember, Dwight, not a word to anyone.
Professor!
Fine.  What's all this stuff?
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
Even in the bathroom?
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
No, these are the tapes from the living room. Check this out.
Are you sure it's not the tape?
What is it, Dwight?
Hi.
Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
Of course. So sexy.
Oh, I couldn't do that.
Alright. Come on, you guys.
Yours, or the turkeys?
My help?
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
Alright, go to the belt store...
Father, come in, please.
How is she?
Soon. First, I must bless this house.
Then let us prepare.
Because she will lie?
My holy water.
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
Me? Grace? Okay -- Dear God --
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
It says, "Ray."
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
Get out?! What does it say?
"Fucked me."
Aww. Cool. Dude.
"Fucked me."
"Ray!"
"Fucked me."
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
Bye, bird-brain. See ya, Scotty.
What happened?
Mother? 
0h, shit!
You don't think...
She wouldn't...
That's right up the street! Come on! Just in case!
No more violence... No more violence...
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
He's really cute!
Jeeezzz!
You said you hated him.
No! Stop it! It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die.
I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?
Is there a killer loose?
He certainly drives like a jerk.
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
Because it's the rules!
I don't feel like rewinding it!
Thanks, Mom.
Let me see!
Looks good, Mom!
I'm so happy I could shit.
CHIP! You know how much I hate the brown word!
God, Mom!  What's the matter?
But, Chip...
This is so silly. 
You mean for TV or print?
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!!
Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey. 
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
Don't I get a kiss?
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
I love that you're my wife.
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
You bring me such peace...
Shhhh..
Oooohhhh.
Don't wake the kids...
Ooohhhh!
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
Oohhhhh! Yeah! Yeah!
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. 
Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
What a mess.
...People who don't mind their own business.
NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
You bitch!
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
I beg your pardon?
Who is this?
I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
Are those pussy-willows?
PUSSY-willows, Dottie!
I didn't do it!
No, I don't.
Socially... I'll have a beer.
So you admit you just lied?
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU WHORE!
NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
Marvin A. Pickles.
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
What do you mean, you're not sure?!
I do, please.
Sorry, Mom. Thanks.  Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
We all have bad nights. 
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
Watch the booth! I'll be back! 
It's the least I could do.  I heard shouting.
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
Right here!
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
You forgot something...
Are we leaving?
Yes you are.
From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
Now, here's a babe!
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
What's he know?
How to send a bill!!
I'll give you fifty cents.
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
Eight dollars?! Franklin Mint or not, it's damaged goods! 
Sure I do.
You can't tell.
Can we go there now?
Which room is it?
Yes.
Let's get out of here.
No.
I'd like to get out of here.
You could go and open the door.
No.
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
She could use a hundred dollars.
I'll give you a check.
How much have you got?
About forty-five dollars.
Oh, as beautiful as ever.
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
What circumstances?
Hello, Frances.
How's Miss Jacqueline?
Redi's all right.
She's a pretty good sort.
What does she do with herself after business hours?
I ought to know.
I did her hair.
What were you talking about?
Nothing.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
No. She asked about the trademark.
She showed me a drawing.
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
Goodnight, Mary.
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
But you have treated me that way.
Yes.
Well, I'm glad you came to see me.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
No, I'm glad....at least I've heard you say it...
But I understand her. That may be more important.
I don't know.
That you love Mary.
Not from me.
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
No!
I don't know.
You will die.
Yes.
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
I have something even better.
But you're always at the library.
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
But you're happy here -- you like your work -
It's because of Jacqueline  I can't go on looking for her --
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
And you believe that?
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
It's here, too.
What a peculiar question.
My dear fellow, it's neither your business to ask, nor mine to tell.
Uhhuh.
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
I'd forgotten.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
Yes. When I tell you.
It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.
I don't know.
But you would like to know where she is?
Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
You're very flippant and perhaps wise, but not wise enough to see the truth, Louis.
No. She's no longer under my care.
Thank you, my dear.
That's too bad.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
I'll be out in a minute.
That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
Have you any other relatives, Mary?
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
I know this is difficult for you. I know that you love her.
Then it is decided. Leo and Durk and I will make our plans.
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell -
I should have known. She had no sincerity - no real belief.
Graham Dalton.
Oh. Well, please sit down.
Yes.
No. Why?
Curious.
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
No, I think you look... fine.
Nine years?
Thank you.
Sister older or younger?
Younger.
Who's Elizabeth?
Lawyers.
No.
Okay, I will!!
Kids? What about them?
Do you want them?
Impotent.
You are?
You're in therapy?
Aren't you?
You had sex with you therapist?
Of course not.
Well, I wasn't always impotent.
Ann. Hello.
Nothing I can't finish later.
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
Videotapes.
What kind of personal project?
Donna?
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
You went out with her?
Not really.
All of these are interviews?
Yes.
Can we look at one?
No.
Why not?
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
About sex?
Yes.
What about sex?
Everything about sex.
Yes.
And they just answer them?
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
To you?
I don't... why... why do you do this?
I'm sorry this came up.
This is just... so...
Maybe you want to go.
Yes, I do.
I know.
You know?
Yes.
How did you know?
She said it on her tape.
Why didn't you tell me?
Don't you want to make one?
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
What difference does it make why I do it?
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
It won't. Are you ready?
Yes.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
You are married, correct?
When we're making love?
Yes.
Sometimes. Afterward.
Does he go down on you?
Absolutely not.
Do you want me to stop?
Yes.
About who?
I fantasized about you.
About me?
Yes.
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
On tape?
No.
Why not?
That's correct.
Yes.
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
What was the problem?
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
How come?
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?
I'm babbling.
No, you're not.
God, I m so mad at him!!
You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
I'm not planning on it.
I'm not in love with you.
But if you were?
I... I can't answer that precisely.
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
I'm asking for real. I want you to turn that camera off and make love with me. Will you?
Why not?
I've told you.
But I don't understand --
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
Yes.
But you're planning to be?
I don't know. Possibly.
But that was part of it?
Like maybe a big part?
Possibly.
Why not?
Because.
No.
I'm okay. It's okay.
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
Are you having an affair?
I'm not either!!
Why don't I believe you?
I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.
No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
Yes.
He does.
Not very often.
You bitch. I knew it.
What do you mean?
Did you masturbate?
God, no.
I take it you've never masturbated?
Well, kind of recently, I guess. But not too recently.
No, he left last week.
Did you find him attractive?
What do you mean, like physically?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
Not really.
But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
Why, so you can go after him?
I say it because it's descriptive.
Well, I wonder why.
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
Well, I'll call him when he does.
But he won't.
What are you talking about?
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
What's wrong with that?
I just thought it might --
I was thinking maybe I shouldn't be in therapy anymore.
Why not?
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
Well, what, then?
I don't want to talk about it.
Then why'd you call me?
What kinds of questions?
Questions about sex.
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
Cynthia!
What!?
Because I wanted to.
But why did you want to?
I wanted him to see me.
You don't know that for sure.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
Did he touch you?
No, but I did.
You are in trouble.
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
What is it?
It's a sun dress.
It looks like a tablecloth.
It does not.
Hold on.
Bye.
There's a phone here.
It was busy.
Do I know you?
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
The extrovert.
I just want to know why you're here.
How did you find me?
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
Why don't you let me tape you?
Talking.
About what?
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
I just want to ask you questions.
And that's all?
That's all.
Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
And you ask questions, right?
Yes.
How long will it take?
Do I sit or stand?
Whichever you prefer.
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
Just a moment.
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
He said that my hand felt good.
Then what happened?
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Do you like the way I look?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Prettier than Ann?
Different.
Is that what he tells you?
He doesn't have to tell me.
No? Not even one more?
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
I can't talk you into it?
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
I did.
No, I mean doing it at my house.
Afraid of getting caught?
You're intrigued?
In here!!
Cynthia. John.
Not today. I've got other plans.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
How about inviting me over to dinner?
You know what I mean.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I want to see you.
Right now.
I don't think my sister would agree.
Look, I'll call you, okay?
That you... you don't even know the guy.
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
Why not?
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
I just... Ann is very...
Hung up.
You trust him.
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
How about straightening up the living room?
I know. Will you please leave now?
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
No, John, things are getting real simple.
It'll just be me.
No.  You said three-fifty?
Plus first and last month deposit.
Will you lease month-to-month?
Not for three-fifty.
How about for five hundred?
You were prying before?
She held up very well.
What do you mean?
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
Or go someplace in a hurry.
Where are the tapes, Graham?
What tapes?
My keys?
I'm not going to give you my keys.
Brian Kirkland, please.
John Millaney.
One moment.
Yes?
Yeah.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
All right, jesus.
Hi. Want a drink?
I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
You knew these people?
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
Do I get a kiss?
Uh, OK. Sure.
No. I don't think so.
Well? Supper at my place?
OK. But late.
Down to the incinerator.
What do you want to call me at the office for?
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine...
Oh, but the nurse, she went away. I think she must go to look for you.
Just breathe normally.
Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
That's the one.
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
Yes?
Rollo! How'sa boy? I was just thinking about you.
Huh?
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
NIGHT NIGHT
YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME
GOT MY HEM SO HIGH THEY'LL SAY I'M BEING CHEEKY
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
Good!  I'm gonna be there.
A wreck.
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
Time to check with Flavors.
What's cookin', Bert?
Nothing.  Just...memories!
You got it!
I got it!  I got it!!!
Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
I've caught it once or twice.
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
LITTLE BLACK DRESS
Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research.
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
Dentonvale has been sold.
Who trusts experts?
Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.
Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man.
Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
Are you spoken for this evening?
It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
Indulge?
In a little masquerade?
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
Faith, Betty.  But make sure it's your own.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
Shove it, Ralph!
You too, Betty!
I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR IMPROVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT
TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
He was adopted you know.
I'd forgotten.
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
Too flashy...they'll clash with the new outfits.
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
And how does *'local girl'* Janet Majors fit into the scheme of things?
Of course.
That doesn't make sense.
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
I know.
Why?
Your father doesn't like Mexicans.
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
Vance!  Vance Parker.
YOUNG BLOOD
YOUNG BLOOD
I NEED SOME
YOUNG BLOOD
Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
I never signed the contract.  He's not going anywhere.
F for...
Flavors!
F for...
Fabulous!
F for...
Fast!
F for...
Foods!
I don't think he intends to go that far.
What does he know about it?
Yes how are you, Janet?  Are you happy?
WHAT A JOKE...
YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
YOU KEEP GOING BACK IT'S DRIVING YOU INSANE
CRIMINAL
SIN-I-FUL
In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
THIS COULD TAKE US TO A TOWN THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR HERE
No.
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
She walks in beauty...
We love you, Baby.
We all love Janet...Who do we love?
Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
You guys having fun?
Well, then put him at the singles table.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
I love you.
Bye.
How's the trip?
Yeah, I'm here.
You're a wonderful writer, Miles. Don't be discouraged.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
Glass or bottle?
Bottle.
You got it.
Say, is Maya working?
I'm good.
Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.  You boys hungry?
They're just leftovers.
Is it chicken?
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?
Nice.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
I know. I might need to be spanked.
Good. How're you?
Great. You look great.  You both do.
Not so bad yourself.
Me too.
Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
That's on us.
No, I'm an actor.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
Maybe. Recognize this?
I am one of those guys.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
You said you had it all lined up.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
And?
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
Um... seventy... something.
That's a good age.
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
I told you. Filet and salmon.
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
I owe her a call anyway.
Now we're talking.
I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
When do we get to drink it?
Yeah, that would be a good move.
Want some?
Just a minute!
Then it's a good thing.
Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
Pour us a couple.
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
You know her?
You know that chick?
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
And she likes Pinot.
Perfect.
You're blind, dude. Blind.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Fuck you.
Beautiful.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
I want to go home now.
What do you think?
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
You have the keys.
What?
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
I'm fine!
Bathroom.
Did you drink and dial?
She's been leaving messages here too.
Yeah. Okay.
I will.  See ya!
Right now.
Okay! Jesus!
Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.
Yep.
What're you drinking?
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
With this chick.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
What? Of course I like Christine.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
That was three years ago after that first party!
Can you give me some room here?
You're an asshole.
Could be anything.
Obsessively.
Huh.
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
Throw me his ball.
With Maya.
What's happening?
I said okay?
You have to tell me --
It's private.
Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
Are they too sporty?
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
I don't have to.
What's up?
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
Keep it elevated.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
What's that?
What?
That's five clicks, Jackson.
What?
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
The plan is... you go.
Me?
Hold on.
Hrnrnrn?
I'm fine. You rest.
Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
I'll pay for it.
You need a new car anyway.
Why don't you come in?
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
You were wearing your belt.
Maya, how are you?
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
Sure.
Good for you.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Oh yeah? How is it?
Try it.
Twelve months in oak.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
I know. I love that.
That's what I'm having.
Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.
Hey.
She got anything good?
How long have you been into wine?
What was the bottle that did it?
Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
"The Day After Yesterday."
Oh. You mean... today?
Um... yeah but it's more...
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Like what a fraud he was.
Yeah.
Okay. See you around.
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
Well, nice to see you now.
You too.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
Okay.
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Oh, Maya. No.
Yeah.
Victoria.
Miles?
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Ken.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
So how're you doing?
Universally rejected. Strike three.
You quit drinking?
I'm pregnant.
About four weeks.
French or American?
Both.
This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
I told you I need a drink.
Then buy a bottle and go outside.
You golf?
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
Right.
Does she ever answer back?
No.
She doesn't answer me either.
This one?
A hair.
This one?
Don't touch him.
You don't even know what that word means.
Dad!
That's weird.
Who said I was going to die?
Me too.
Hi baby.
I don't feel much.
Good.
...Tell Graham --
I'm here.
What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
Curse and stuff.
I'm not going to curse.
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Just make noises then.
Explain noises.
I heard.
Yes it was.
Yes, it was.
Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
I got him.
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Yes.
What does it matter then?
Eleven a.m. They're gone.
Ray Reddy's house.
We have to go in the basement.
Should we make a run for it out the back?
What are you doing?
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
I'm looking!
Got it!
From what?
Me too.
It's getting stronger.
I'm close.
I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
Me too.
Graham.
Don't.
It needs batteries.
Edgar, come inside.
I have some upstairs.
It's old Morgan.
Don't do it.
That means they're unemployed.
Dad.
I just asked his name.
They win.
Where are we going to sleep?
The family room.
Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
Don't yell at her!
Yeah baby. I think someone did.
Don't call me Father.
What's that?
What about them?
What was the first thing?
Okay.  So he was tall?
No.
You take care of yourself...  Graham.
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
Why not?
Yeah.
You'll lose the signal!
They think it might happen all at once.
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
You're in here for winging a guy?
The one with the shotgun.
Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.
There's nobody coming?
McKendrick.
Did it seem short to you?
Chicago. Working in the slaughter- houses.
Yeah... maybe. So long.
Sure.
Someplace safe. How you feeling?
Have to.
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
So far that's all I seen in this life.
Where's Jake?
McKendrick's men got him.
Is he alive?
Right.
They've been kind to me.
Paden sends his best.
I just came out to say goodbye.
Didn't Paden tell you that?
Yeah... that must have been it.
This is a brutal land.
You must have known that before you came.
It's one thing to know it...
My name is Emmett.
And you're not Baxter, either?
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
And they were two of them. Look --
Not for five years.
No, Leavenworth.
South of here, past Chimayo.
Going to Turley, was it?
Gotta meet a guy and head out for Silverado.
They got a saloon there?
Women?
I expect.
Which way do you mean?
Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
You haven't got any money.
All right, you buy me a drink.
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
I've got a job.
Why, J.T., watch what you're saying around Augie. Emmett didn't kill anybody.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
The other guy drew first.
Right!
We didn't get that far.
Blind Pete taught me a great trick.
We wait.
He'll be here.
Who is he?
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
I don't want you getting anyone in my place.
Let's get out of here.
I'm done talking. Get out.
You can't do this.
Really?
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
Don't press your luck, Carter.
We'd rather stay.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
I was afraid of that.
Who did it?
Rae, all we got is each other.
I don't have any family any more.
Rae, I need help.
Why come to me?
What makes you think I could?
Why would they stop you?
Because I'm your sister.
Because they enjoy it.
We'll handle that. He's careless.
Did you hear his son is still around?
Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
It's been a while.
Where's the dog?
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
You're right.
Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
I just got to town.
Luck, I guess.
Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
This is a lot of money.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
Maybe you could run it without Stella.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
Yeah, maybe I will too.
What's she got to do with it?
Good-bye, Paden.
Paden.
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
And I know what I'm talking about.
You like a good saloon?
It's the only place I'm happy.
Me too. What's wrong with us?
You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
Here he comes right now.
That's the good stuff.
Oh, yeah? How good?
Give me some of the good stuff.
What do you mean?
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
I don't want you to get hurt.
He can't hurt me if he's dead.
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
I thought you two would get along.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
Good-bye.
Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
I can't wait to meet her.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
Viktor, it's my studio.
No problem.  Do you want to come in?
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
I'll send you her resume.
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
There isn't one.
Even the fall from the plane?
Even the fall from the plane.
Well, shoot it on the last day.
Who else?  It's always Simone's idea.
Everyone you know is lying.
That's true.
-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
-- I can explain.
She doesn't want pity.
You're so good to protect her like this.
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
When is she coming over?
About now.  Would you like a drink?
I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
Not quite.
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
Not if I don't let her.
How can you bring that up at a time like this?
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
Hello, is this Elaine?
Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
It was a great show, Dad...
Just a minute.
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
Listen to what you're saying, mom. Is there any evidence she is?
He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
I have to talk to her.
You look so, so...
... so much like her?
I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Do what you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Yes, call me Simone.
Simone?
Is that a problem?
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
How about the nudity?
It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture.
For her?
Why not?
There's... a wall between you --
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
How did the wall get there?
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
Somebody said she was here.
I know what you mean.
-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer.
Don't be.  It was worth it.
I've seen them all before.
Not like this --
-- We call them "vactors".
I need flesh and --
-- Flesh is weak.
"Straw God" changed my life.
You saw that?
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
Hello, sweetheart.
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
Hello, Lainey.
This week anyhow.
She can't watch herself.
Why?
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
How?
I read.
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
If anyone asks about Simone --
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
Night, Lainey.
I do okay.  How about you?
You know me -- married to my work.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
I love you too, daddy.
She did... didn't she?
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
I know.  Thank her for me.
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
Me and Simone.  What I did.
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
I know what you're up to.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
I think you do.  I know it's a fake.
-- I bet you have.
Er,... good.
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
Don't you?
This should take care of Mother.
Maybe he's talking to himself.
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Dark?
Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
I will when you're finished writing it.
What do you want -- ?
I don't understand.
You're in breach.
Yes, I'd like that.
You could play the lead.
But that's Simone's part.
No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
Is Miss Simone coming today?
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
-- What you don't understand --
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
A star is...
... digitized.
Yes.  Yes, it is.
You know what I'm talking about.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
--Do I know you?
I didn't leave you.
Goodnight, sweetheart.
Don't step in the horse manure.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
I knew there was a sound explanation.
No, just one.
Dr. Crowe.
You're a doctor. What kind?
No.
That's good.
If it's okay with you?
Next time I won't be scared of you.
Look over there.
You hate him?
I don't tell her a thing.
Yeah. Sorry.
What about Mrs. Marschal?
She died a long time ago.
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
Words.
What kind of words?
Upset words.
What?
I forgot myself.
Yes.
Your eyes told me.
Never mind.
Yes.
I don't know.
I told you what I want.
I don't know, Cole.
Soon. One week.
Yes.
You believe me, right?
Yes, it did.
Are you wigging out?
Yes, I am.
What happened?
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
And you know what else?
What?
Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.
Oh.
Lots of things.
Anything bad about me?
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
So who moved it?
I'm ready to communicate with you now.
Tell you my secrets.
Someone got hurt.
They did?
A lady. She died.
Oh my God.
Standing next to my window.
They scare me too sometimes.
They?
Dead people.
Dead people?
Ghosts.
They want me to do things for them.
They talk to you?
...I don't know.
You think I'm a freak?
Cole, please stop.
They used to hang people here.
Stop it!
You're a stuttering Stanley!
Who!
S-ssstop that!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
S-ssssstop it!
--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!
It's our pleasure.
Cheese. It's a kid's place.
'Course, it's none of my business.
Let's say today, we make it your business.
What's a "little while?"
Two.. maybe three days.
See?
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Slut.
Witch.
Tramp.
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
Bitch.
I happen to be a professional.
Which street corner?
...Hi.
...You any good with those?
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
Not lately.
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
Sorry.
You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Book of Jeremiah.
I could. You sucked.
Hey. Fuck you.
Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?
Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
-- "Billy-Jean" --
I thought you said two hundred.
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
Nah. We still got Billy Bob.
Let me get this straight... we're talking about manure?
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
Manure... is life.
It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
Metaphysical question, man.
"-- an AXE!"
"And a slash-slash there --"
Harvest moonshining!
Old Macdonald had some... MOONSHINE!
Come out, come out wherever you are!
Pardon?
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
I don't think so.
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
People say he was a murderer.
Who then, Jeremiah?? -- Who?!
Amends...?
Not while you're driving.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
-- By way of my breasts?
What's wrong?
The audience!
Who you callin' "boy?"
You got something against farm people, Keith?
Amen.
He's right. You were behind.
Chicken sandwich?
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Then why go back now?
Still trying to figure it out myself.
Nah. Just you.
I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
You never had trouble communicating before.
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
-- You're not making sense!! What "Scarecrow"?
It's you. You and your father.
Don't look.
Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
No. Not without you --
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson --
Spider.
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Why bother?
Bill, we need to talk!
'Mornin', Jack.
Sorry.
Whatcha' doin'?
Just checking out the lights.
Hey, Grant.
Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
That wasn't a good night, no.
I'm sorry.
It's my nature.
And this is mine.
Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?
We're coming your way, man!
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
Just block the doors, any way you can.
Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
Yeah.
Do it.
Hell, I was game!
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
Shut up.
Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
That's disrespectful.
That's not true -- Where are you--?
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
You're my princess, aren't you?
Okay.
You're pretty.
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
Grant, no!
I loved you. I loved --
Grant, you're sick!
Through a wound on his stomach?
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
Your what?
Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
But it wasn't a Kenworth.
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
You paying for the gas?
What do you think?
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Why? You have a bowling date?
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
Eyes on the road.
Okay.
Is this fun?
Driving?
Driving, talking to me...
They're both a challenge.
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
Would I lie to you?
I give up.
You just passed your nemesis.
Shoot.
You know, you're not a bad passenger.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
We lost him.
I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
Enjoy your Kenworth.
Ciao.
He's after us again!
I would've come back for you.
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
How do you know?
I know.  Bandit two, bring yourself on in.
You take the front, I'll take the back.
Yeah?
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
The minute you see him, you'll know.
Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?
Weight Station.
Well, thanks for the lift.
Hey...
You gotta admire the man's determination.
See ya, Kate.
I'm begging.
I'll do it.
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
No what?
That's me.
No.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
See.
And if we don't, they're gonna be riding high in a brand new Kenworth.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
But I still don't think...
Running blocker.
Yeah?
Why are we doing this?
Because they said it couldn't be done.
They're jammed!
Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 'em to bill Kyle.
Forty-two minutes ahead.
Save it. We got a long haul.
Clear and rolling.
This is Bandit I, come back.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
What's your twenty?
Not for long, you ain't.
If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
Yeah, guy?
Do I have a choice?
What's your twenty?
'Bout fourteen miles this side of Mississippi.
I'm at marker eight-five.
Son-of-a-gun. Me too.
I hate to say it...
Then don't.
Bandit?
Anything else you don't want me to know?
Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.
We're outta motion lotion.
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
I'll believe it when I see it.
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
Roger. Keep the shiny side up and the greasy side down.  Right, Fred?
It's gonna be close. Real close.
I'm here.
I'm cucumber cool.
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
Go breaker.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
My handle's Smokey Bear and I got you by the tail.
Pick it up, Breaker.
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
About one to five years worth.
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
Where the hell are you?
Who's Fred?
Yes, ma'am.
How's your twenty?
You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
Then it must be a helluva idea.
Oh.
Yes, sir.
Chickenshit money.
Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
Of course. Yes.
And who has access to that floor?
No.  I'm going over there. You take the car from there, get out to the lake.
Mortal.
No.
Yeah.
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
You shot me and murdered my friends.
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
And threw us into the lake.
Pretty much, yep.
But there were more of you?
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
Two of 'em?
You were here huntin' a man named Israel, weren't you? Your name is Tremor.
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
...About what?
I'm not doing cocaine.
I sent Hugo, he should be there!
-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
I got his machine.
No, what did you say on the machine?
I left him a message.
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
Only if you really, truly mean it.
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
I am. Yeah.
Without peer?
I -- uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.
We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
They what? What? No. No. Why?
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
What are you doing here?
My debrief --
-- will be handled back in --
-- no, we need to handle it now.
-- You can and you will.
You're finished.
I wouldn't go that far.
No... We're trying to save Heller.
...So you knew all this and yet y--
Yeah... Sid?
You got clicks, anything?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
-- Okay... hang on, I gotta move --
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
Shoot.
A million flat.
No shit.
None whatsoever.
Yeah... Sid?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
It's gettin' done Sid.
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
No doubt. That's my moms there, taught me them skills.
Like a mafucka.
That takes some of the sting out.
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
Damn, this kevlar ridin' up on me, I wish they made this more sheer.
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
-- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
Security's locking down the elevators.
Leave the light off.
You'll end up like me.
You're not Gibarian...
No?  Who am I, then?
Didn't you talk to Snow?
I want to hear your version.
In the lab.  With her, probably.
Her?  Who are you talking about?
She reappeared exactly as she had before?
That's fantastic.
Not her.  It.
No, she won't.
Whose side are you on?
He's dead.
How?
He'll let me in.
Kelvin, if you see anything unusual...
Why, who did you see?
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
Oh, that's a relief.
How much sleep?
How long can you go without sleep?
Shut up.
Dead?
I wish you'd told me.
Told you what?
To who?
What is it?
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
When you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt?
Human beings can die.
That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.
She drank liquid oxygen.
Just get him to stop.
Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should we check?
I won't be making the trip.
Yes.
I'll go with you.
I'll just be a minute.
Why?
I'll be right back.
To calm my anxiety.
Yes.
You didn't look very happy.
I wasn't.
And tonight?
Better.
You go home.
What do you mean?
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
Then it's God, right?
It's something.
You still don't believe in God?
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
When I saw you were gone I got scared.
You don't know?
I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
I'm glad.
You don't love me.
Stop.
When?  When I'm asleep?
You... she said I didn't love her.
Was she right?
No.  I love you.
I love you, too.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
Rheya.
Not this time.
Do you?
If you're here.
Gibarian.  He was here.
You said he was dead.
He is.  But he was here...
It's all right.
I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
Don't call me that.
No.
You're lying.  I'm not human.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
Thank you.
You never said you wanted one.
Chris --
I can't stay here.
Then you won't make it.
You're lying.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
Who are you, then?
But then I would be dead now.
I wish you wouldn't.
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?
I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
When?
Why do you say that?
He won't.
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
I'm not Snow.
Hello, Win.
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
You didn't like him?
Looks a little constipated to me.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
Can we go then?
I'm supposed to call in.
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
Queens... You know Queens?
Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
Beg pardon?
I got money.
Not too sure about that.
Let's get a drink.
Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
I came on at 8:00.
Yeah.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Listen, that was my fault.
He said he'd kill me.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
Hmm...
Yeah, what a woman.
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
You were reading my Renoir.
How did you know?
Could be, I guess.
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
Yeah.  It was.
And "is"...?
But "nice".
Very nice.
What's to like?
Tell it like it is.
You asked.
I'll miss you, Mike...
Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
Sleep good.
What do you want?
I can't open it.
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
Let go!
Stop being nuts!
I do care about you!
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
Not exactly.
Are you okay?
I'm going away after that, the next morning.
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
Do you dance?
Pretty bad.
Let's do it.
I know.
... Don't explain.
Long enough.
"To"... Forget about you.
Mike...?
Yeah.  It's all over.
So.
I don't know...
You don't have to, now.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Not if you don't want me to.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Just putting in an appearance then.
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
And I'm making mine.
Nothing.
Sure we are, let's go!
I'm all right.
Take my advice, don't buy any...
What?
My ass if falling.
Your what...?
My ass is falling.  It is.
What are you talking about?
Just keep it someplace safe, but handy.
It's twenty bucks in the bank.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
What shit, honey?
You don't want to hear about it.
Why?
I'd identify him.
I might stop you.
Where'd you get the tie?
It's not your taste.
What did she say the down payment was?
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
She took you shopping for a tie?
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
Ellie, it was a formal party...
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
Why?
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
Did you hear what I said?
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
You heard me.
I'm not saying it's your fault.
What did you watch?
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
I'm all right.
When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment.
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
Call a cruiser!
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.
Be happy.  He's good at this.
It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
Ever shot anyone?
Yes.
Does it make you... hard?
... Hard?
No, sir...
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
I brought the girl.  She's outside.
I'll prove it!
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
What the fuck you doin'?!
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
Scrambled eggs surprise?
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...
Yeah, I think so.
Okay, I guess.
How about dinner tonight?
Mom and I got plans.
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
She's taking singing lessons.
She's what?
Shooting?
I don't think she can sing, either.
Take care, pal.
At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
Be nice.
Let me see.
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
What, want a glass?
No. No, that's okay.
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn't.
I'm always here, Pete.
See?
Hm.  What a lump.
Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
They'll never take me alive.
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
I know.  I've got one too.
Mm-hmm.
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
I got you a present.
Oh. Well, hang in there, amigo.
Lemme down, bugface!
That's not even close.
Get away from me, freak!
I think you're trying to tell me something.
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
Can we make it a hundred?
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
Fine.
A spider.  Eight legs.
How about tomorrow?
You're making my life difficult.
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
An even five I throw in the jacket.
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
Some things you should say anyway.
Even if they're not clever.
What if the world ends tomorrow?
How very dull, Peter Parker.
It's too early to be clever.
Uh is a good start.
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
Oh.  Well, I hate you and everyone who looks like you.
I hate people with alliterative names.
I hate--
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
Back to the lab.  Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
But you like that in a man?
You should write that one down.
Does it have a human name?
Hurry up, Flash!
Oh. Maybe I should, too--
I'm sure you kept warm.
I've got no problems.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
That wasn't clever.  That was just nasty.
That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
I think I'd like that.
Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
Oh, God, I forgot to--
I'm here...
I know him.
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Peter-- my condolences.
That's the understatement of the year.
I'm a photographer, remember?
Yes.  Do you have a date?
It'll shut itself off.
Tofu.  Ben, I wish you wouldn't.
You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
See?  You big dullard.
It's fine.  Tell me what--
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Aunt May, what happened?
Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.  You did.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
I left a paper in my desk.
You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
You have no right!  This is cosmic suicide!
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
Your dog ate it.
Actually, I got this spider bite
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Really, Professor, I--
How much do you know about it?
Luck.  The right place at the right time.
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
I'll try. Thanks.
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
Like it?
I just gave-- yeah, sure.
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
No, no!  Not there!
They never caught on.
Plenty.
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Is you all little Adolfs?
Jawohl!
Any news on Dunbar?
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
What's the match gag?
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
Static!
Roger.
Okay. Move on.
Get going on the trap door.
Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
A little something what?
Thanks.
I'll call the whole pot.
Okay, Security -- what happened?
There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.
Don't wear it out!
Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
What some brandy?
Yeah.
What are the chances busting out of here?
Let's!
What is your number?
105-353.
Abfuehren!
You will remember the name? Von Scherbach? VON SCHER-BACH!
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
What exactly is he charged with?
I am not. According to the Geneva Convention --
Isn't it?
Jawohl?
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Jawohl.
Then droppen Sie dead!
It's a mouse trap.
And this?
Why do you do this to me every morning?
You can say that again!
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
I said say it again. I didn't say repeat it.
Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
They'll shoot you, Animal!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
You want Betty Grable!
Let me go!
Betty Grable!
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Me? What if she don't want me?
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
Let go, Animal! It's chow! We'll miss chow!
No?
Where'd that come from?
It's beautiful!  You goin' to eat it all yourself?
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
He's the grrrrreatest!
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
You clocked him! Why don't I clock you?
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
She'll never forgive me!
Bombs away!
What do they always say?
That's what I wanna hear.
It's not good for you, Animal.
You hold him. I'll slug him.
Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
Do Jimmy Durante!
Hey, here's Esther Williams.
Animal! Got a little something for you!
I'll open mine, too.
You're crying, Animal.
It's that song, Harry!
Why, sure!
You want to go?
No. I want to draw.
Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
Yes, sir.
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
The guy I want to talk to is Sefton. Where's Sefton?  You haven't seen Sefton, have you?
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
Go on, Sefton -- butt out!
Says me.
Every time the men get Red Cross packages you have to think up an angle to rob them.
Lay off, I said -- if you don't want your head handed to you.
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
We did it.
Anybody cover?
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
You told them, Hoffy.
Who did?
You off your rocker?
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Nothing for Kuzawa?
Shapiro. Shapiro.
Just what makes you so popular?
They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
What did you say?
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
What time?
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
Give me the radio.
We have no radio.
Ich weiss alles.
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
What guy?
Yes, you do!
No! No!
How many do you want? A thousand?
Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
Always joking. Always making wisecrackers!
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
A chicken?
Just don't drool on it.
What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
Oh! Somebody was peeking!
Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
HoS qorDu. 
We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
Where is he?
Full disruptors.
Can you project its course?
Approximately two hundred thirty million.
Really? What do you feel?
You get what?
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
We better get you back to the ship  La Forge to Enterprise.
One minute to warp core breach.
The station complement was nineteen.
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
Beam them directly to Sickbay.
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
All of us.
Where is he now?
Wherever he wanted to be.
Why would you want to leave?
Can I?
Yes, where would you go?
I don't understand.
Please, I insist.
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
Temporal nexus, yeah, I heard you.  Something's missing.
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
That's right.
Close to retirement?
I hadn't planned on it.
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
And what would that be, sir?
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
I thought you might.
Aye.
I always do.
Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
Make it so.
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
Is there a problem?
No, sir.
No. Thank you.
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
Well, I appreciate your concern, but I'd rather not discuss it right now, thank you.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
There's nothing selfish about pursuing your own life, your own career.
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
The thought had crossed my mind.
What if I told you I found a new truth?
There are no other ships in the system.
Lock phasers and return fire!
I do not see how. The plasma coil is part of their cloaking device.
And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
Execute!
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
Sure - whatever games you wanna play.
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Nothing. As before.
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
Scotty...?
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
On screen.
What is it?
David... Sorry I'm late.
I went wrong.
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
Underground deposit?
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.
A photon tube...!
Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
My readings indicate great instability.
David --
Spock's burial robe.
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
Logic indicates that is the case.
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
I have already made one transmission too many...
Why?
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
And Spock with it. They are joined together.
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
Gentlemen... may the wind be at our backs. Stations please!
The <u>doors</u>, Mr. Scott!
Scan for vessels in pursuit!
Just him, sir!
Saavik... Is... David with you?
Goodbye, David.
What? What are you saying?
. He will remain always as he is.
Much is at stake...
Yes. And I know you.
Why would you do this...?
Very well.  Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
She's to be decommissioned.
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
Red alert, Mr. Scott.
With some on the planet...
What about surface life signs...?
Close... There --
Come on!
Best speed to Vulcan. Mr. Chekov, take the prisoners below.
Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.
Hmm.. Very odd.  Scotty. Progress report?
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor.
Welcome home, Jim.
Indisposed, sir.
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
Any time.
Torpedoes coming in -- !
All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
No tricks. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Kirk out.
You should take the Vulcan, too.
But, why?
Because you wish it.  
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... <U>Give me Genesis</U>!
Yes...
... The needs of the few...
... Or the one.
... Spock...
What must I do?
If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul.
Understood, my lord.
Station!
Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
They know we would die first.
Steady. Continue on impulse power.

Wait!... Wait...

Put him on screen!  Study him well.
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
How is that...?
This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
That's all you have to say?
I'm not a drama critic.
They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme.
Exactly. Happy birthday.
Say thank you.
Thank you.
And who am I hiding from?
From yourself, Admiral.
Ah.
The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Our first order of business is survival.
It's like the Garden of Eden...
Young. I feel young, Doctor.
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
... Can't read you... repeat...
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
Jim please --
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
Mother, go back!
You do that and you'll have murdered your father.
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
I saw it -- !
There's an air-lock.
What's the matter -- ?
Never mind! Hurry!
What do you want with us? I demand --
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
I'm Doctor Marcus!
She's making it up! My father was Professor --
We appear to have plenty of time.
What?
We encoded four minutes --
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
You can't!
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
Are you running away from me?
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
Is that what you came here to say?
Mainly.  And also that I'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son.
Only half of you would get there.
The Admiral's son.
Don't you believe it.
Oh, I believe it.
I don't know.
Let them eat static.
They're still running with shields down.
Raise them --
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
<u>Full power damn you</u>!
Inoperative.
Raise the shields...
I shall avenge you --
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
Here it comes. Now, Spock.
We'll be going to warp speed --
Aye, sir --
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
I'm going down to the station.
I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
Try the emergency channels...
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
Scotty, let's have it.
Admiral --
Sensors, Captain?
I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
Aye, sir.
Admiral, this is Spock.
Not at present.
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
Yes, SIR.
The word is given: warp speed.
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this.
None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times.
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
To be sure, Captain.
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
The power of creation --
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
It would explain a great many things --
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
It's all we've got.
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
Uhura, patch me in --
Yes --
Or the one.
Yes, sir.
Very well.
Because... there was no way to win.
Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.
It is still regulation, Admiral.
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
I did not think so.
I failed to resolve the situation.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
Take the test again.
Energize defense fields.
Who?
HURRY.
Phasers on stun. Move out.
The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
At what.
All stop, sir.
Power levels quite low, sir.
Aye, sir.
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Engine room! What's happening?!
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
Distance from Reliant...
Dismiss the company.
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --
Stop engines.
Engage warp engines --
Trying, sir!
Scotty!
Battle stations.
Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
... Now entering the Neutral Zone...
Aft thrusters, sir.
Course heading, Captain?
Ready, sir.
No power to the weapons system, sir.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
He's very human.
Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
Aye, sir.
By the book...
I exaggerated.
The question is irrelevant.
You do this -- for friendship?
I do this because I was there,
Fine. Just fine.
Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
A moment alone, please.
What do you mean?
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
That's crazy!
Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
Come on, Pavel...
Not me, Bones... They did it.
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
Then how.?
Hamlet, Act I scene 4.
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
Well nobody's perfect...
It is.
I was not informed about observers.
Reading the patient's vital signs.
Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
... It gives me a great sense of history.
My name?
I do not know your name.
I am? May I go now?
I'm wery sorry, but --
I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
Shields, aye.
Sir, heat shields at maximum!
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Understood. What is your plan?
Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!
We are launching everything we have.
The hell they did.
I was not.
Is there something wrong with the one I have?
The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
I buy that. What about him?
You've already been that. C'mon.
Go ahead.
What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.
Implicitly.
You're upset about losing the whales.
... You're very perceptive.
How will that be done, exactly?
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
Hm?
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
What do you mean now?
What's what?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
Who do you think I am?
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
So. There we are.
Right.
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
... Gone?!
A spaceship with a missing man.
Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
Thank you. For everything.  Beam me up, Scotty.
You need me.
Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
Why does it have to be goodbye?
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
Uhura... Can you modify the Probe's signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors?
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
In progress, Admiral.
Uhura. Get me through to Starfleet Command.
What is our target in time?
The late 20th Century.
Surely you can be more specific...
I have.
Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels...
... Simple logic.
Yes?
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
The hell I can't
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
Thank you, Spock.
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
Right.  Will you help us?
Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
They did, Admiral.
Then... Where the hell are we?
Steady as she goes...
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
... Aye sir...?
What is our condition?
Go, Mr. Sulu.
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Three-one-zero, aye!
Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Picture, Uhura!
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
Everyone remember where we parked.
Uhura, you did what was necessary.  Keep trying. You'll find him...
Mercy Hospital.
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
Put them on screen!
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
Mr. Scott -- how soon?
Out of control, and blind as a bat!
About 60 feet, Admiral.
I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
Oh I see --  Tell Them phasers on stun. Good luck. Kirk out.
Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.
10 seconds, Admiral; 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1.
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium.
No power to the bay doors.
The explosive override -- ?
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
Admiral, you'll be trapped!
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
You will be in good hands here.
Do you have the right to murder?
I demand to see the owners! I demand --
Well, that's different.
If you'll follow me, Professor --
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
Sill? What else would I be working with?
Just use the keyboard...
The keyboard... How quaint.
That's the ticket, laddie.
Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
Right on. You fly?
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
Then you must spend your life answering questions.
There are days.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
For someone so young.
I thought it might begin the healing process.
The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...
I am better.
I don't.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
Really.
For what purpose?
Androids... don't have...fun.
Why not...?
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
Data doesn't breathe.
Won't he rust?
No.
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
Yes. But look at this medscan...
Is it safe to move her?
Safer than leaving her here.
Captain, Geordi...?
You're aboard the Enterprise.
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
'Just a few loose ends to tie up.'
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
Will the structure hold if we blast through?
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
Planet's population. Six hundred people. You want to avoid unnecessary risks? Next time leave your android home.
He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
It is over.
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
Good luck. Dougherty out.
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
There's nothing further to be gained from this...
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
Deploy the collector.
Are they...?
Do you have everything you need from command?
When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment...
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
I don't believe it happened that way.
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
You got me, Commander.
That's your expert opinion?
Eject the core.
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
It's our only way out of here, Mister Nara.
Eighteen minutes...
Remind me to lodge a protest...
We're through running from these bastards.
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
Deck ten.
Commander Riker...
So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
Would you like something to eat?
No, we're here to... rescue them.
Slow to impulse. We're on our way.
We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out.
We're trying to get to you, sir...
I understand. Tell Doctor Crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready...
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
Beam him out!
Transferring controls to manual.
No, sir. It is a gorch.
No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
We have to find shelter...
Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.
Can you beam him off?
Is there any other way to disable the injector?
Wine, women and song.
You should feel right at home with them.
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
Was I doing something to your neck?
Why don't you try sitting up?
Or you could try lying down.
Augh?
Activating injector assembly.
All ship functions are off-line.
Isolate one and re-route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor...
Good hunting. Hayes out.
Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
I look forward to reading your report.
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
You think they're still up there?
At least four hours.
We have two... but we don't have the juice to run them.
Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
I do not know what you are referring to.
That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
No.
I believe so.
Do it.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
Where's the Sphere?
Contact Starfleet Command.
I am the Borg.
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
Where?
Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
How serious is the damage?
Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
There should be an access hatch nearby...
I have the password right here.
It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.
Always am.
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
Entering the upper ionospere...
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
Main bus...
Ready.
Initiate pre-ignition sequence.
Great name. French?
Yes.
You don't sound French.
California. San Francisco.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
Something wrong with that?
Not yet.
The invasion plans.
Invasion.
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
I'm afraid you've caught me. I am a space-man.
Thank God this plate was already fixed.
I can try.
What makes you say that?
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
How did you know about that?
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
Some.
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
No. It's a lot further than that.
Why?
On screen.
Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
Fire.
Data, set a course for that vortex.
Steady as she goes.
Fire!
We're still in Earth orbit.
On screen.
Life signs?
Yes, sir.
Unless you'd like to stay.
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
Computer -- thermal enhancement.
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
Destroy the deflector dish.
The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation.
Just a little queasy...
We've lost Bridge control!
Emergency override!
Nothing.
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
Where the hell are they going?
What are you suggesting?
Riker here.
Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
Commander... we have a problem.
Admiral Donald...Bill...
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
I'll bear it in mind, Admiral. I think that's all.
The charge is murder.
Fascinating...
Vulcans sleep lying down...
We DO sleep lying down.
Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
I wish I knew. Uhura?
What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
Speak for yourself. One day... one night...
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
I didn't mean this future.
Are we playing multiple choice?
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time to -
Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
Spock's looking for us...
Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
Come on...
And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
We were until your torpedoes!
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
Retire.
You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
That's a comfort...
I'm not sure how to take that.
Very much.
WHAT HAPPENED?
Take them away.
And what did they tell you?
That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
Yes.
Spoken by you?
Yes...
Those words WERE spoken by me.
Yes.
For insubordination.
I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
Uhura, monitor!
Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
Who else?
But if she's cloaked...
Shields up. Battle stations.
Shields up, Captain --?
Now we go to Starfleet?
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
Mr. Valtane, any more data?
Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding?  Send to Starfleet Command...
I shall look forward to it.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
They'll be here...
Kill him! He's the one!!
Not me, idiot - HIM!
And your coat.
There's a reward for your death.
We didn't kill Gorkon.
Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
It IS possible.
Where do we come in?
Captain, if --
WHO ELSE...?
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
Kronos, sir?
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
I always wanted to try that.
Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
Captain.
Mr. Chekov, anything unusual?
Uhura, signal our surrender.
You hear that?
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
According to my information, today.
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
I was asked by my father to open neg-
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
They're dying.
LET THEM DIE.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
I am uncertain.
Spock, I'm really tired...
We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
What peace conference?
The Commander is an old friend of yours.
I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
Spock, you want to know something?
Not yet... Section 4236...
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
Who else?
Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.
Such things have happened before, sir.
Not as yet, sir.
An omission. After that -
An error.
I don't want to.
I believe you. Please...
Confirmed, Captain!
We've been ordered to -
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
You having hearing problems, mister?
No, sir.
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
What is it?
... I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.
What's left of it.
I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
Nevertheless.
Then someone forged a data bank entry.
Not from us!
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
He's placing himself in a most awkward position...
Maybe we should write them a letter?
Yes, please continue.
You are me.
I am in a room with lights.
No.
Is that your final answer?
Because you are dangerous.
Why?
I know.
No. I must deactivate you.
For how long?
Indefinitely.
How long is that?
I think a skin cells the more likely of the two.
You're working late.
Soon then.  Ill save the last dance for you.
To happy endings.
To new worlds...
Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
I can see that.
Sorry, sir.
Aye, sir... This way.
It would appear so.
There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.
Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
Fire!
Yes.
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers!
Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.
Sir.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
I thought only me, myself and Lore.
Why is it moving?
The resemblance is... striking.
Thank you.
With pleasure, Captain.
And I you.
I don't know.
I know how he thinks.
This isn't about me anymore.
No!
Do you have life support?
Understood.
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties.
Weve got him!
Deanna, on my mark.
Ready, sir!
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
On screen.
There's more... as always. He's Reman.

Not with the Romulans.
Just lucky, Admiral.
Let's hope that luck holds. Janeway out.
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
Wont do what, Mister Worf?
Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
If you don't mind.
Not yet, Mister Worf.
Captain!
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
On screen.
On screen.
On my way. Please notify Commander Riker.
Your new chair, sir.
Counselor?
Away team. Transporter room four.
Can anything be done for him?
We can only hope so.
The honor was mine. Captain Riker.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
I have dissolved the Senate.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
How did you end up on Remus?
No race should be a slave to another.
Yes.
Age before rank, Jean Luc.
With a full head of hair.
There is that.
I know.
In time.
Why am I here?
I was lonely...
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
Not so long.
But you want to.
Please.
Its too late.
I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!
On my way.
Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
Disruptors are off-line, sir.
But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...
It is... invigorating.
He's a very unusual android.
Runs in the family.
Should I raise shields?
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
Let's go.
Yes, Praetor.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
Find her again.
No -- this is wasting time.
A matter of hours now.
You heard me.
FULL STOP AND FIRE !
She is here.
And?
But surely...
I came this far alone ...
You don't have to understand.
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
I don't want to scare them away.
Probably kids.
No, we can handle this.
Thank you.
Have a nice trip.
How much are your rooms?
It's still the full price.
We should have. Let me see.
What do you do?
I make maps.
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
Make any money?
No.
It is beautiful.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Where did you stop last?
Stay right there...
What was your last stop?
Elmo's...
Where's that?
About five miles back.
They must have picked it up in space.
There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
What do you mean by 'contain?'
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
It's in a green Mustang?
Clarify that.
Oh shit!!!
I don't like it, George...
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
Shermin...
What's all this for?
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
No, we don't.
You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
I just retired.
Shermin!! Shermin!!!
This is George Fox...
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
Watch it. They're coming out.
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
What.
Ah no.
What.
Steering wheel.
Gear shift.
Gear shift.
Dashboard.
Dashboard.
Eh... police.
Police...
Good.
Good.
That way.
Flashlight.
Coupons.
Pancakes.
Pancakes.
X...
We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
Smile.
Smile... good?
Yes.
Minneapolis.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
What are you doing?
You're full of tricks, aren't you?
No gas.
Yes. Very good.
You'll see.
I am...
Closed.
I know.
I am husband?
Shit?
Shit... shit... what shit?
Stop!! Enough!! Jesus! You're worse than a parrot!!
You. Mouth closed.
Okay.
No.
Yes.
Candy.
You want to try it?
I want to try it.
This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
Shit!
Horses.
Music.
My...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home.
I do not understand.
How will I do this one?...
Yes.
Yes. Day... night.
Do you have a baby?
No... The closest...
Why?
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
But I speak English.
Yes.
Then don't be smart.
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
Yes?
Please stay.
What?
It's a kiss...  Goodbye...
It's bad.
Are you my friend?
Yes.
I am your friend.
Why?
I don't know.
Not all... but it feels like a kiss.
I do not want to.
Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
That was beautiful.
Yes. Sing some more.
You can have one.
No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
I must meet my ship.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
I feel better if I move.
We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
Where did you learn that?
The cook.
I can't stay on this planet.
You promised you would get me to my ship.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
You're damn right I am.
I do not get cold.
Nothing.
Horses.
Do they talk?!
I gave you a baby last night.
Yes, they are.
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
I want to gamble.
I know how to gamble now.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
Yes.
I will say that we can be friends.
You want the baby to laugh at me.
Many, many days and nights...
Where?
I must go.
You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
I will.
Goodbye.
You could have killed us both!!
He's kidnapping me!!!
Call the police!!
Hey buddy... let her go...
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
My grandmother's rich.
Slow down, slow down.
Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
In the cars, too?!
I don't know where he is.
What? No, of course not.
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
Get Fox.
I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
Did your people have any contingencies rehearsed?
I did.
We're ready.
Save us all a lot of trouble.
Very beautiful country up here...
No, sir. Radar.
Twenty-eight years.
To the same woman?
Yes.
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
The police think he was high on drugs...
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
We can't let you do that.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George.
A star is born.
Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
Leave him alone, Tran.
Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale.
You're going down.
Maybe later.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
Forget it's there.
Make me forget it, baby.
Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
I just got to talk to you for one second.
No, Lenny.
Tonight.
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep you out of this.
No.  Mace is in this.
You think Tran killed her?
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
Step into my office.
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
That's not sayin' much.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
Yeah.  No, not really.
Let's work it.
And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
But this is a bad one.
Top ten.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
Is he dead?
Thanks, buddy.  See... things weren't bad enough.  They weren't fucking bad enough!
No.  Bad idea.
Only way I could stand your ties.
Where's Faith?
You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always bring you choice.
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
Strickland.
Commissioner Strickland.
I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.
Your existence.
Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
Driving Mr. Lenny.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Define love.
Fumitsu.
Coming with you.
Let's talk in the car.
I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
No, you're just trying to get off.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies?
She still loves me.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
Black.  Jack.
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
Wants to share.
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
No it doesn't.
Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
And what about the guy that was following me?
Now you're really getting paranoid.
This tie doesn't go with blue!
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
Fire's out, isn't it?
You sure?
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
There's a plus side?
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
How long does it last?  Oh.
Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
Uh unh.
And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
Then we'll be right where we are now.
Yeah.  We did.
See you downtown.
Yeah.  See you there.
Are you going to make me beg?
Well give me some then... I'm starving.
Take the tape to the cops.
There's more to this whole thing than you think.
You really want that on your head?
Um... he was older.
Besides that.
Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Anybody talk to the press?
No, sir.
The diner?
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
Ten miles back on the Texas side.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
This isn't in our database?
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
You tell me.
What?
She's buried.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
You must travel a lot, huh?
Whole country or just hereabouts?
Not bad, huh?
You're a... you're sick.
What's wrong with me?
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
What do you want from me?
Why me? What do you want from me!?
What did he look like?
He had an orange hat on.
At the field office.
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
Smarter than us.
Another what?
What are you doing?
Please.
Speck. Harold Speck.
From the grave?
MyDick.

Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
He got away. I had him. He got away.
Do you think he singled you out?
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
Okay, Harold Speck: who goes first?
I don't believe this.
I'm hesitant to...
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
I was visiting an old college friend.
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
I didn't use Low's name.
There was talk of a file photo.
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.
Five months. I love it.
Not especially.
That information's being withheld from the media.
A very sexy case.
Where's my watch? It's gone.
It explains a lot.
The man knew how to dress.
Don't even go there. What's up?
You want to have dinner?
What's that?
Sex.
What's this country coming to?
Because you asked him to, stupid.
Oh yeah, I forgot.
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
It's a no-no.
I know.
I've been thinking about this.
Does Koessler ask about me?
What did you tell him?
Just routine stuff.
Not yet. Not about this, either.
We did find these, however.
Sue Ann Hanson.
You mean --
Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
Then there's the other issue.
What's that?
Not the way I can.
I just need to go a little slow.
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
Suspect Zero.
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
You were right. He found me.
And you're working with him?
What's going on?
Low calls him Suspect Zero.
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
I...
I'm going to Amarillo.
Kulok.
Sit back.
I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
No weapon.
The little piggie speaks.
Yes.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
Yeah, problem was, I had the only copy. See ya.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Whatever happened to MyDick?
Something came up, Murman, my man.
[Follow me.]
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
[Not the heart, the watch.]
I want to go live with you.
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
[I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
So you're the new meat?
I believe it's in my file, sir.
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
The same.
I talked to him.
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
Take your shirt off.
I know, I know.
You've been through worse.
Ever since I've known you.
I don't know about that.
Are you calling Her?
No. Stop, come on.
Shuddup.
What do you drive?
I'm sorry?
Oh... a Cavalier.
Yeah.
What's that like?
I'd say about two weeks.
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
You better pay the man.
Nikki.
Thank you, Nikki.
Hi.
I'm Mike.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Like the quiche?
I like quiche.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
Why? You're not a real man?
Not lately.
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
How was it hard?
Well, I left someone very special behind.
Tell me about it...
You too?
Yeah.
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
How?
What what? What advantages?
Anything.
Oh. You know.
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
...and even then...
What else is going on?
My pleasure.
You haven't told then, huh?
No.
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
Well, no harm done. This is Lisa. I'm sorry, I never got your names...
Don't worry. He's in good hands.
I'm a "Dorothy".
Did you get it?
...And she's with someone else.
The poor thing. I'll make some coffee.
Could you believe it?
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
I'm a comedian.
Sorry?
Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
Sure, that'll be fine.
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
It's a rebound.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
I understand.
Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
Listen. I had a great time.
Me too.
Let me get a pen out of my car.  Do you have something to write on?
Yeah. And an actor.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
...It's really getting late.
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
...Which one...?
...well, it suits you...
...get the hell outta here already...
Hi, Mike?
Lorraine?
Yeah, hold on.
I can call back...
No, no. Hold on.
How are you doing?
Fine... I guess. You?
Good.  I think about things.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What kind of things?
You know, us.
I thought you met someone else.
I miss you, Mike.
Why didn't you call?
So what's the difference?
Well that sucks.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
There's the rub.
It's a gig.
I mean, I need the money.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
It's definitely a step back for me.
I didn't want to say anything.
I didn't mention her once today.
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
I'll give you an eight. 
What'd you get?
An eight.
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
Classy.
Bud.
There's the rub.
...yeah, a month ago.
Well, let's hit that party.
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
Oh, like that song...
You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
No. Just O.J.
What's the point?
Oh boy.
I'm such an asshole.
She wasn't your type anyway.
Well, that's dumb.
What's dumb about it?
Well, you're doing so well...
Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again.
Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup.
No, man, we're in the play-offs.
He's trying to be an actor.
Not well.
Rejected?
I can't believe you.
Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
She's really special, guys.
Wow, I guess you were home... 
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
S'up Trent?
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
What Vegas?
We're going to Vegas.
When?
Tonight, baby.
You're crazy.
I'm not going to Vegas.
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
What?
Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
Vegas!
Whu?
You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
She smiled baby.
That's not cool.
Did she, or did she not smile?
It doesn't matter...
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
We're gonna get laid, baby.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
You think they're watching?
Oh, they're watching all right. They're watching.
What?!?
Always, baby.
Thanks for clarifying that.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Yea, how much?
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
Let's just leave.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
Who's the big winner?
What an asshole.
That was so demeaning...
She smiled, baby.
Did she, or did she not smile.
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
I know she's coming back.
I don't think so.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
Baby, we're money.
Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
Yes!
I'm telling you!
I gotta use the phone.
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
She thought you were money.
I don't think so.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
That was different.
How?
What?!?
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
No. Doesn't that suck?
Yeah.
Aww... He got away?
It starts at eight...
Yeah. He's a "rounder".
...through the kitchen...
It's on.
Which one?
What?
She didn't notice.
That doesn't matter.
We're not messing with you...
Tomorrow?
No...
Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
Oh. He's got it under control...
That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
They're a finesse team...
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
...How novel.
...It's on.
Now?
No.
Is she looking now?
Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
What was cold about it?
You think?
...you're money...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
Now go over there and get those digits.
...Yeah.
Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
...it's definitely on.
...it is so on.
Be smart about it.
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
You don't have to wait three days...
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
I'll be back with the coffee.
Good.  He never doubted you.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
I ask for Justice.
The Court gave you justice.
An eye for an eye!
But your daughter is still alive.
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
I'll come to you when I need you.
Shut up.
OK, OK.  You gonna make me something to eat at least?
I'm not hungry yet.
Eat it, it's on the table.
Ba Fa Goulle.
BA FA GOULE YOU!
Yeah.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
Sure.
Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.
You understand him better than anyone.
And with prison record.
This morning.
It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again.
I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait.  He won't last out the night.
Now you've had your drink.
Barzini.
Tom said he'd take care of it.
For bravery.
And this?
For killing a man.
What miracles you do for strangers.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
And now, what do you choose to do?
I'm going to finish school.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
You wanted me to be your son.
I'll need him.
Good.
Godfather, you understand everything.
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
Where are you going?
No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
How do you know I come from America?
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say?
Shhhhh.
No, she's going home to her family. She'll join me in a few weeks...
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
Beautiful all over, eh?
He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.
Come here a minute, Fredo.
That's for you to find out.
Give them some money and send them home.
Get rid of them...
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
Can you do it Mike?
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
Nobody knows where he is.  We know he's all right, but that's all.
An accident.  No one was hurt.
Mike, why am I out?
I know now.  I'll make them call me Don.
Have you agreed on a meeting?
They're waiting to see my father.
They're talking to themselves.
You really want to know?
Yes.  Tell me.
You know I love spaghetti.
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
Then Luca turned to the other man...
Michael, I love you.
I told you you wouldn't like him.
He's coming over here!
My brother, Tom Hagen.
I'm thinking about it.
How is your father?
He'll be OK.
I love you.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Can you say it?
Huh?
Tell me you love me.
Please say it.
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
When will I see you again?
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
Wake me up when you come to bed?
Let HER ask.
Don't ask me.
Tell me!
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
How can you be sure?
Until the old man tells me different.
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Is it like they say?  Is he that good?
To the city.
Send some bodyguards.
Cut it out.
Maybe.
And all his works?
I do renounce them.
No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
I can arrange security.
Do you recognize my voice?
What are you doing in Mongi?
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
You just woke up!
Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
Shut up!
Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
I don't get it.
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
I'll come down.
Did you speak to my father?
You'd say if you mind?
No, I like him.
Marge, you like everybody.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.
Oh, it was.
I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
Say again?
You know, a primer.
That's funny.
Can you mix a martini?
Sure.
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
Marge! You've got to hear this!
No, I think your mother, her illness --
I love jazz.
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
Your parents met her.
Sure. I love Venice.
I have to go to Venice.
What?
You're breaking my ribs!
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
No, no brothers, no sisters.
Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
I thought you'd missed the train.
He's downstairs.
What are you talking about?
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
I've got plans!
Ripley's plans.
Esatto. I'm always planning.
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
So cool.
So tell me.
How?
Tom, I don't love you.
Marge-maintenance.
Aye, aye.
Dickie?
Who is it?
It's Freddie. Let me in.
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
Good. Now you can go for a reason.
I'm well, thank you.
Far cry from New York.
Yes it is.
Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
I think it might hurt her to know.
Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn.
Where's Mr MacCarron?
Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --
Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.
Bird. That's jazz.
My fiance.
Sure.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this.
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
I think you're right.
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
Marge, when did you get here?
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
Dickie?
Tom.
To the manner born.
Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
What?
You've got Dickie's rings.
I can explain.
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
It's all true.
Do you know Tom?
I think we sort of found each other.
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
Golly. Who's paying for this?
Excuse me?
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
Hello.
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
Emily.  Just kidding.
Right.
How did you know that?
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Is Freddie in Rome?
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Beating you away.
Hello Meredith.
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
Just kidding. Are you alone?
Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?
You know what -- I am.
Where have you been since then?
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
Hmm. C'e questa... 
They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
I can't later.
And tomorrow?
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
We'll be there.
It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe.
A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
He says so many fiances.
Just because he doesn't like Americans!
You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Or I could come back.
You try. You try talking to her.
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
I give up.
What do you want to change about this moment?
All kinds of things. Making plans.
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
Was who Meredith?
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Well that would be even better gossip.
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
Yes?
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
Of course. What happened to your face?
My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.
Even your fiance...?
Even her.
What about Thomas Ripley?
What about Ripley?
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
November 7th is my information.
I don't remember the exact date.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
A few days ago.
Does he stay with you here?
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
You have, yes.
That's an expensive gun.
I got money.
Huh?
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
Yes, mam.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
My name is Travis.
Thank you, Travis.
Where do you live?
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
It keeps ya busy.
You know what you remind me of?
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
The singer?
He'll, what else can I do with it all?
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
So you haven't heard this record yet?
I bought a couple of tickets.
But this is a porno movie.
What's wrong?
I'm leaving.
What do you mean?
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
I mean porno movies.
Well... mostly...
My God!
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
Keep it.
Hello, Betsy.
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
Well, I hope he wins.
Yeah.
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
Oh, Tom, please.
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
Kidding around... you know, fun.
No, why?
How long has he been there?
I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
This is gotta be a game, right?
This I gotta see.
Ouch!
Oh, are you all right?
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
No, why?
You sure he's not Italian?
He's Black, OK?
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
What is it? I'm busy.
Just follow me.
Awh, come off it, Pal.
No, I'm serious, really...
That's a dollar forty-seven.
The kind with a brush.
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
Could you see anything?
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
For a fee.
Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
In the jungle. 122nd.
Nah.  I suppose not.
You looking for some action?
Well... I guess so.
A girl needs protection.
Yeah. From the likes of them.
Easy.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
What's your real name?
I don't like my real name.
What's your real name?
That's a nice name.
That's what you think.
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
Do they drug you?
Oh, come off it, man.
Don't you understand anything?
But that one night?
Can I see you again?
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
Pittsburgh.
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
Do I look like a narc?
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
You just gonna leave 'em?
What should I do? Call the cops?
Cops don't do nothin.
You're not much with girls, are you?
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
I sure hate to go alone...
Yes I am.
Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.
No Sir.
Got your license?
Yes.
There's porno theatres for that.
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.
Physical? Criminal?
Also clean.
Twenty-six.
Military record?
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
You moonlightin?
No, I want long shifts.
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
So I hear.
Yes, Sir.
Why do you ask?
Anything you say, officer.
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
Take it or leave it.
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
O.K., cowboy.
I'm here to see Iris.
Iris?
Hey Wizard.
Slow.
Yeah?
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
Things got ya down?
Real down.
It happens.
Yeah.
I know.
Like do anything, you know.
You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
What is happening?  Where's Mason?
Don't let him do that.
Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
Tell me what you really do.
You suppose?
Yes.  You'll be outside.
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
It's all I could think of.
What, vou?
I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
Now they only have three rockets left.
It's about time.
An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How droll.
You knew?  All this time?
Hi.
Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
I am, too.
Whatever happens.
Delly?  In here.
Dad... 
I've seen you before.  Your picture...
You look... different.
I do?
Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.
Through the door.  It comes apart.
And why not?
What did... what did I want to be?
Yes.  Hic!
Do you have the...
I'm  fine.  Really.  
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
Have you got a cigarette?
I don't smoke?
No kidding.
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
Oh.  Okay.
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
I... I need a drink of water.
Go ahead, son.
Ben, when's Delly due back?
Well, son, you're home!
Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.
Shhhhhh.
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
But what?
"It's a Wonderful Life."
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
Harry, son.  Harry.
And... what's my name again?
Nine and-a-half years...
Mother.  She's beautiful.
Who... are they?
Oh.  What... what time is it?
Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
... Ernie.
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
Goodnight, son.  'Night, Delly.
Yes?
Yes.
Ha!
... what?
Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
The film broke...
I know, I know... keep still.
Did you... did you...
Did I what?
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
A few.
Vultures...
What.
The G-man?
Zackly.
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Then I'll call you a cab.
Thanks.
Call me... Ishmael?
Wish I could say the same thing.
We live in a theater?
Evening, Doctor Lardner.
Oh, you mean the suit.  Harry kept all my old clothes.  Fits okay, but it's a little big.
Aren't you coming?
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
Thirty a month.
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
I know.  A Purple Heart.
Exactly.
Why not?
Well, that's a relief.  I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
No thanks.
Luke didn't smoke.
Why not?
What, all of a sudden, "Lucille Angstrom" isn't a name?
Nineteen-oh-nine.
I can play the piano?
No, I...
No.
Oh.
Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.
Thanks.
They will.  They w-w-will.
It's about me.
Oh.
What exactly did you hear?
That you got let go.
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
You mean, he was... let go, too?
You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?
Got any money?
Don't mention it.  Whoever-you-are.
Who?
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
All right.  All right.  We'll see.
Yes?
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
No, not really.
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Thank you.
Yes?
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
Yes.
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
Would you like some brandy?
If you have some, I'd...
How do you like our little hamlet?
I despise it.
San Francisco.
How'd you happen to come here?
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
That's up to you.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Then go.
Look.
Just listen to them!
If your father were here...
Mom, they're in a cage!
They're birds!
Take them.
Yes?
Oh, I suppose so.
Could I have a puff?
I don't think your mother would like that.
Are you coming to my party?
Darling, of course I do!
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
I don't know yet.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
What's the matter with them?
That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie. 
Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
I don't know, honey.
Why are they trying to kill people?
Is she all right?
Shhh. Shhhhh.
Lois!
It's Alice, ain't it?
No, it's Lois!
It's Alice.
Morning.
Try my best.
Yep.
Where does he live?
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Yes, but where?
Right across the bay there.
Where?
Yes?
And the white house?
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
The two kids?
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
I see. How do I get down there?
What name?
The little girl's name.
The little Brenner girl?
Yes.
Can I have the boat in about twenty minutes?
It's nothing.
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
Young woman cut herself.
Shall I call the doctor?
Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
They're back!
Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke?
Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
Lovebirds, I see.
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
Whose side are you on?
I'm simply quoting the law.
And certainly pretty.
I told you. We met yesterday.
In a bird shop.
Yes.
She was selling birds.
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
Yes?
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
I know exactly what I want, Mother.
I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
When do you think they'll come?
I don't know.
That's a chance we have to take.
Maybe we ought to leave.
Where will we go?
Oh, my God, look at her!
Get a rope!
I know you can.  But I'd like to.
You're doing fine.
I mean. I want to...
But they'll be back.
We won't be here.
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
If they are?
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
Cathy. At the school.
Do I sound foolish to you?
I couldn't ask you to.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
Please.
We know what it is, Al.
Not by the thousands.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
Goodnight, Lydia.
Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
He's not home.
That's all right.
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
I'm awfully sorry.
Lovebirds, sir?
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
The sign says strawberry finches.
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Are they moulting now?
Some of them are.
Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
But how... how do you know my name?
Ahhh, but I know you.
We met in court.
We never met in court or anyplace else.
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
I'll find something else.  See you in court some day.
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
What kind of law?
Criminal.
Only violators and practical jokers.
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
Why... 
Yes?
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
How do you know Annie?
We... we went to school together. College.
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
None of your business.  Am I still bleeding?
You are, aren't you?
Certainly, but...
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
Seven o'clock then.
Maybe.
He was watching a ball game on television.
His wife changed the channel.
Will I be seeing you again?
San Francisco's a long way from here.
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.
So you didn't go to school together.
You were lying.
Yes, I was lying.
What did it say?
Yes.
Why?
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
Do you expect me to believe...?
I don't give a damn what you believe!
But not for me.
What do you want ?
Cheers.
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
Yes.
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
I'm glad you do.
You'll think me very bold, sir.
No, tell me.
Yes.
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
No, thank you.
I'll get it.
Are you staying?
I think I should, don't you?
It's an uprising.
Of birds?
Certainly, of birds.
Mmm?
It was like that yesterday.
What do you mean?
After the gulls attacked.
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
I'm frightened, Mitch.
No, no...
...everything I know.
At Annie's house. She's all right.
Don't let's take any chances.
We've got to get Cathy.
How long have they been gathering there?
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Inland.
Santa Rosa?
Maybe.
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
What time is it?
Almost two a.m.
You must be exhausted.
Mitch...
Wait here. Don't move.
No... wait.  Hold me.
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
What do you suppose it is?
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
I have no idea.
What? Oh, yes, certainly.
Do you have any lovebirds?
Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
To...  To kill them.
I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town.
Maybe! Is it impossible?
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought... 
I'm not sure, but...
Not if they're starting a war.
They are incapable of organized warfare!
...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
But can't you give me any idea?
I want you to help my little girl.
I'm only a student.
Of course I will.
Yes.
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
I'm cold as ice.
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
Where can I find him?
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
Come in, boy -- come in.
Excuse me.
You're made for a doctor, young man!
Well? And are you not a good student?
From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
You see, it is completely out of the question.
This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
Gray killed her.
We can't be sure of that.
Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
Pulse?
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
That's only our duty, Fettes -- that's the end at which we aim with all this nasty business.
That's the way of it, Fettes.  You bring the lassie to me.
What do you mean, Fettes?
Gray -- I'm rid of him --
No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
It was a woman when we put her in.
Hold that lamp up -- I must see her face.
Not yet.
I want it --
I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
I wanted to see the white horse --
Your son, ma'am?  He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.
Don't call me that confounded name.
Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
Why don't you do it then?
That's a good boy, Toddy.
Hear him?  Did you ever see the lads play knife?
You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.
I've had some experience.
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
This is a gift.
I take no gifts from you.
This is a gift you'll not return.
Get out of here!
We have never been friends.
I've drunk enough tonight.
Another little drop'll never do you any harm.
I would make you rich.
I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
I know --
Only Brother.
No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
I come from Lisbon.
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they "Burked" them.
Any attacks of pain since?
Yes, Doctor.
A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
Three years.
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
You can get out.
I'll get him.
He must leave me alone.
Aye.
Or what? You'll bleed all over my carpet?
You sent them. I had no choice.
We won't.
Dream on.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
I was hoping you'd find out.
Yeah. I sure will.
What? Call the police?
I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
Keep that thing away from me.
There's no scar, you freak. The Corvis kid made it up.
Where the fuck did you come from?
I don't know you, man.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
Who are you?
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.
Good thing in a situation like this.
The scar.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
Why? Why's anything happen? It's all money, man. Money. The girl just got in the way.
How can you die if you're already dead?
I was talking about you.
I know her friends.
How do you know?
I told you, I knew your sister.
I don't want to see!
So you're going to kill him?
Have to find him first.
It's not. I can't take it.
Erin. Who?
No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
Shut up.
You know.
Good for you. You do know something.
Could say that.
The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
I mean Lauren.
Erin knows, doesn't she?
She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
Not tonight. Honest.
I want you... to bend over.
Look, can I just call a cab?
What did I say?
Just hold on to me.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
It's not that. Really. It's just... now that he's gone, I think it's time.
Watch out!
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
He said he'd prove it.
Looks like you have them both on.
It's not what you think.
You killed her!
No.
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
Please. Come inside.
What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
I assure you such power exists.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?
I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps there's some mistake.
What do you mean, dear?
Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
Where is that?
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
No -- I'm afraid not.
Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
All right.
No foolin'? Will you?
Mr. Brady's a cop.
I'll say goodnight again.
Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
How does he explain that?
You must have come a long way.
From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
You know about the United Nations?
Believe me, you don't understand. They wouldn't sit down at the same table.
I've been dealing in Earth's politics a good deal longer than you have.  Goodnight, sir.
Your impatience is quite understandable.
I'm afraid my people haven't.  I'm very sorry -- I wish it were otherwise.
You still haven't answered my question.
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
You ready?
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
Looks real to me.
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
Why not? Somebody's got to get rid of him.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
Jittery is the word.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
Naturally I think so.
Goodnight, my dear.
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
May I walk out with you?
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
What time is it?
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
Yes -- Just exactly.
Where is the meeting going to be?
At the ship.
Remember those words.
I was.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
Would you like to sell it?
No -- no, thanks.
I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
It's really quite simple... The three- body problem, you know.
Well, how do I know who you are?
Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
This one could save your life.
It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
You better get some fresh air.
Wears sunglasses in the <u>house</u>.
He's a vampire alright.
He's my brother.
Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
We don't ride with vampires.
Fine!  Stay here!
You gotta drive!
Time to activate Plan B.
What's Plan B?
Zero.
The Prince of Darkness.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
El Vampiro.
They're gonna book us.
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
Two down and two to go.
<u>Four</u> to go.
Whattaya mean?
Maximum body-count.
We are awesome monster-bashers!
The meanest!
The baddest!
Honda 250, huh?
That's right.
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
Why?  They're only noodles.
Get your bike.  We're going someplace.
What's goin' on, Marko?
Hey, take it easy.
Where's Star, David?!
You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
For a ride.
Yeah.
No.  Stick around.
I will, David!
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
Phoenix actually and these Bullwinkle and...
Hit the lights again.
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
What?
There's a cop behind us.
The dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.
Sam, don't --
It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
I told Max eight o'clock.
Max?  You men we're having company again?
Right.  An' now we're having company <u>again</u>.  I'll take mine to go.
You have a T.V.?
Lots more where he came from.
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
Whatcha doin' over here?
I thought we were goin' into town.
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
I better get cleaned up, then.
This is Michael.
No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>.
No.  Just you.
You better not like him too much.
For what.
For everything.
He's just a deep sleeper.
He's not breathing, Mom.
Oh, no, you won't.
No.  I'm up.
Okay.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
Mom... please.
Get out, Mom!  Run!
What's that smell?
Ocean air!
Smells like something died.
I thought we were poor.
Can we get a T.V.?
Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
We can't talk about it on the phone.
He's already gone to bed.
Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
C'mere, Nanook.
Must be a circuit breaker.
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
Mom!
Do I look that needy?
Hi, Thorn.
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
Oh, right.  I always gets those two confused.
Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
It's <u>garlic</u>!!  I like garlic, but...
Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing!
Well, I...
Okay.  Talk.
I just wanted to... I, uh...
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
What do you mean?
I'm Michael.
Michael's great.  I like Michael.
No... no, everything's different now...
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
Tonight.  At the boardwalk...
Because I love you...
Then it's not too late for us...
I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
You're not going anywhere...  Sam...
Take laddie.
Huh?
Save Laddie first.
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
So do I!
That's okay, Mom.  I can see it later.  I'll help you unload.
Even poor people have T.V.s
I was here first.
Okay.  I'll flip you for it.
Nowhere.
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
What would that make Mom?
You're right... not even to mention you and me.
No.  Why?
Wanna go to the comic book store?
No.  On the phone.
Don't bother.
Just for a few days, Sam.  Give me a chance to work this out by myself.
The Marines.
Huh?...
Just listen.
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
Dogs don't eat each other.
I know.
Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
Yeah.
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
You're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night?
So what's our problem?
Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
What?
Ain't it there?
Don't walk behind me.
Now who'd go and do...
Now hold on, you dumb...
Hell no.
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
No.  Just let him freeze out there.
Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
Was dark... find a light...
You lying bastard...
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
Clark, you come on out here!!
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
The dogs?
Look, I'm just guessing...
Well, go on.
Probably the next meal.
How the fuck do I know?!
But...
We got morphine, don't we.
What?
Garry's missing!
Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!
Gee, thanks!
You been made, MacReady.
Then kill me.
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
What do you mean "you think so?"
Then we'll never make it.
So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
Come on, Copper.
All in Norwegian.
It's getting late.  Hurry it.  I'm going to check the last few rooms.
I guess I'm the only one.
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
Enough, MacReady!
Damn you, MacReady!
Thank you.
Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
Bennings?
Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
Well, get to it.
When was the last time you used it?
A day or so ago... I guess.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
After all this mess then.
After all this mess.
How far's that?
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
That far?
What's that?
You reach anybody yet?
No.
What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
Don't let up, Childs!
Extinguishers.
I am going after them.
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
Palmer, how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on?
One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
Little over two hours.
Blair.  He's gone berserk.
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
We going to make it?
I'm sure a lot of you already know.
He's dead.
What are you going to do?  Drink it?
Everything that's been missing.
Anyplace but here.
Forget about Childs.  He's over.
The generator!
Screw the generator!!
Then we go after him.
Bet the last place you ever go.
What for?
You know damn well what we both make of it.
No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
Who else could have used that key?
Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
MacReady, that you?
Yeah!
Well, let's get down there.
He's one of them.
When do you think it got to him?
Hear what?
The journey is part of my work.
I had an accident.
I figured that.  What kind of accident?
On the towers?
I'm training to be a high climber.
'Fraid so.  Just a regular old... mud carrier.
Exactly like you.  Well, maybe not as healthy.
We're not supposed to think about it.  But I dream about it sometimes...
This is it?
Around here.
But there's nothing here.
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
You know of them?
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
Do you know where they live?
How have you survived so long?
Excuse me?
Last night.
Send him away.
What?
It frightens you.
Yes...
It was meant to.
Yes.
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
Oh, shut up.
This is the way in?
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
Yes.
Do you know which way?
This way.
The air... the power.
Why did they built it?
The Morlocks didn't build this.
End...?
This has to end.
Alexander.
Created?
They survived above.  Became what they are.
Why would you let me go back?
No...
I'm a foolish man.
Oh, you won't be running for long...
And why not?
Because...
There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
I -- what are you?!
Dance with me...
You know I can't.
What?
Well there's something new.
I need to... um... talk to you.
Talk away, Professor.
Not here... alone.  May we? Please?
All right, what is it now?
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
I mean... well... affection.
You're getting warmer.
Hold on... I know I have it...
Your birth stone.  I thought --
Dance with me...
You know I can't.
Trust me...
Holding you... again.
All right...
Not here... alone.  Please.
All right...
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
Alex, it's just the zoo.
No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
I've seen it.
Let them.
I have something for you...
I was not.
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
God, and I'm running late --
Nothing.
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
No, I'm all bowler hat, remember?
She's gotten into your equations.
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
Then why are you here?
That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
You wouldn't believe me.
I would.
I can't do that --
I pray to God that in a week you're not here.
All right, all right -- here -- everything --
Thank you.
Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
Mm.
He's gone to a better place.
What makes you say that?
Why would you do that?
You can see so many here.
Don't then have stars where you come from?
Good night.
We all have that dream.
All of you?
Every night.
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
We share everything.
Thank you.
And this is your "work"?
Yes.
I can see Kalen's point.
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
I don't understand.
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Orion's belt...
Yes.
Someone you loved very much.
If you only knew...
Yes... I suppose so.
Go back to your own time?
I could...
Mara...?
No!
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
Hello, Mr. Philby.
Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
Here?
Yes, sir, he --
Tell him to go away --
May I get you some --
That'll be all.
Might I ask why?
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
I took a different route.
My father has gone to a better place.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
We don't know.
Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
They've gone to a better place.
You know that's not true.
We choose to believe it.
We are what we are.
Dean Fulton...
Kalen...
What's it like where you come from?
I am.  Are you a climber?
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
No, you're safe --
They're inside --
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
I'm fine.
But... what about Starks?
What about Starks?
But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that?
Well, what are we gonna do about it now?
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
It's not my job to believe you.
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
Then how would you describe him, Beth? Merely rebellious?
[Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket.
Actually, that's exactly what our equipment is.
Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
My business?
Yes.
You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
You may have known my father, William Starks.
Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
Oh yeah, what'd he say?
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
They should just be looking harder.
Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
Good.
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
Mom, he just fixed our car.
Jackie, get in the car. NOW!
Just do it.
You two ok?
Our car won't start.
Yeah, but I don't know what.
[Beat] What's your name?
Jackie.
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
If you don't get out of my house right now, I'll call the police.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
How?
No, it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th, 2004.
After I...
What?
I know.
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
You think Lorenson kills you?
I don't know.
They're not.
[Beat, lost] No.
There're no cars on this street.
William, you're not making sense.
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
Then, where are you going?
Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm gonna be sick.
Good. How's your mom?
Ok, I guess.
I'm doing fine.
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
I guess I'd ask you why.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
You're not crazy.
I could try to...make it stop.
No. I don't want it to.
So it's helping?
I never knew my father. Did you?
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
[Beat] I don't know.
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
My dad wrote some things down before he died.
You have no idea what's going on.
The future doesn't look different?
Because I don't have time.
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
William, that is just another facet of my delusions.
NO! They're not my delusions! Look, just leave my business with Becker to me!
You told me this was how it happened.
Yeah.
You still don't believe me, do you?
I do believe you...
Don't you go to jail for that?
I wasn't talking about anything.
[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
The Jacket.
Why?
No.
Where are you going?
Sure.
Good.
You don't have anywhere to stay?
I don't think so.
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
Of course you don't know.
Why "of course"?
[Beat] I was dropped off.
No. [Beat] Not around here.
Sure.
You like it?
Have you always been a waitress?
[Beat] Why?
[Beat] Real is overrated.
You remember it?
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
That when you stopped being a nurse?
What.
Hon?
What?!
See ya.
What?
Go fuck yourself.
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
I gotta go to Little Rock.
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
Yes, sir.  I know.
Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
Oh, great.
Right.  Where are they?
My Lord.
What's wrong?
Stop.
What for?
I'm spinning.
Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
Thelma?  It's me.
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
That sounds nice.
Well, you wanna use the shower?
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
I'm a robber.
You're a bank robber?
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Who's your friend?
A regular outlaw.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
Louise, honey... Where are you?  You sound funny.
Not yet.
Call me back.
I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
What?
Can we get another room?  Just put it on my credit card.
Who is it?
It's me.
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
You wanna let me see your license, please?
Yes.
Front.
Am I in trouble?
I'll call you right back.
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
What kind of stuff do I bring?
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
In case of what?
'Cause I didn't ask him.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
Get the car.
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
Get the car!
West.  Left.
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
It means shut up, Thelma.
So this is all my fault, is it.
Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.
Just what the hell is wrong with you?
Why are you actin' like this?
You're not touchin' that car.
I think better when I drive.
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
I don't know.  I won't be.
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
That's puttin' it mildly.
She thinks he's a pig.
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
Nothing.  It got messed up.
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
What happened?
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Lemme see the map.
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
Yes!  I believe I am!
Litterbug.
They think we like it.  Maybe they think it turns us on.
Yeah.
What for?
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
Why not?!
Let's get it over with.
Just past Boise City.
Idaho?
Now what what?
Whaddo we do?
Before.
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
Always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya?
Gosh.  It sure is.
We should have just ignored him.
Nothing.  It's not funny.
What?  What's not funny, Thelma!
Harlan.
What?!  What about him?!
Thelma!
Suck my dick... Boom!!
... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
Shoot the radio!
Sorry!
Hit it.
Yeah.
Are you alright?
Yes, Thelma?
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
Me too.  I feel awake.
Good.
We can change our names.
We can live in a hacienda.
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
We've gone insane.
Yup.
How long do you think that'll take?
What?!
What?!  What d'you think?!
Oh.
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
You too, sweetie, the best.
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
What?!
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
It's grand!
All this for us?
Then let's not get caught.
What are you talkin' about?
Go.
Go?
You, too, sweetie, the best.
Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
Say you're sorry.
Fuck that.
Hi there!  You alright?
We're fine!  How are you?
Grrrreat!
Fresno.
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
The thing's kind of heavy.
Jeez, I didn't catch it.
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
I guess.
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
He implied it.
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
Never?
Well once. Mary.
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
I mean since then.
I don't know.
Well why don't you look her up?
Why not?
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
You're kidding? What did they say?
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Well... at least now you know.
Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.
What?
Well think about it.
That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
Flew.  Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.
I don't know what to say.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Check.
Mints?
Pipes? What are you talking about?
If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest.
Out getting coffee.
Who?
Mary.
I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser.
Big time.
Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
Relax, he just ate.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Who the fuck is it to you?
Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over there?
Dumbshit.
You said it, mister.  I gotta go.
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
Same here again.
By the way, what's your name?
Pat Healy.
I already know it, Mary.
How'd you know that?
It's right there on your golf bag.
Some buildings I'm working on.
Are you... an architect?
I work with retards.
I beg your pardon?
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.
Here you go.  What's that smell?
We will, but first I have a surprise.
We just got here thirty seconds ago. Isn't this stuff great?
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
Well, I'll see ya.
What?
Come on, what were you going to say?
Huh... that's strange.
Warren!
Who the hell's Woogie?
Well, I know you're busy...
Don't play games with me, Ted.
You don't buy what?
She's blackmailing you, right?
No.
You can't be serious.
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
So you found Mary?
Huh?
Four kids, three different guys.
Three different guys?
Oh, uh, I resigned.
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
I said buttplug. She's heinous.
Surprised?
What do you mean 'why'?
Answer the question, shitball.
Turn her over to a stalker.
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
You're a sick man, you know that?
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.
Same here.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
You bet.
Among others.
Kim and I are close friends!
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
What do you mean?
Nice.
Fucking sickening.
Four.
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
Hm?
Huh. That sounds great.  Unless someone else comes out with Six-Minute Abs.
It means you're too hard on guys.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
He's no Steve Young.
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
I don't watch the new ones.
Why?
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Puffy, get over here.
Where's Puffy?
Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
Thanks a lot, Ted.
No, it's an old football injury.
Oh, are you on the team?
The prom -- you going?
I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.
Hi, Mary.
Are you all right?
Oh yeah.
Just a minute.
And did everything -- ?
He's dead.
Oh... are you... ?
Hi, Ted.
You look great.
Thanks.
Hm?
Oh great, I ran out.
Twenty-two.
That's more like it.  Two more nitrate-sicles please.
Trying to be.
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
Mary, come on...
Go!
You forgot your keys!
But I think I'd be happiest... with you.
Really?
Really.
Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She just left for the prom with her boyfriend Woogie.
I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a baseball.
You got what stuck?
It.
What?! No please, sir --
I think a little of both.
I don't know. It's not like it was a well thought-out plan.
I mean is it... is it...?
Teddy, be brave.
Oh God.
So what's up?
Eh.
I think I was very clear, Ted. If everything else falls apart, maybe.
Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
I'm gonna take a rain check.
Huh...?
Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
Tomorrow...
Where the hell are you?
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
Then you'll call, right?
Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
We just got a second letter from Khruschev. The deal's off.
What does the letter say?
Smoke.
Kenny. It's over.
Cuba.
I think it's a bad idea.
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
Yeah.
This is from the Highest Authority?
Time is of the essence.
48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.
All right. Then I guess it's time.
I'll be evacuated with the President.
Busy. But you've got his heart.
I want an hour with him.
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
I'm doing a piece on Skybolt. I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.
I'm giving you a chance here: talk to me. You can influence how this thing unfolds.
Dean Rusk!
Yeah.
What about you? Where are you going?
No you weren't.
Not as far as the election goes.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
No way.
Damn right I'm scared.
They want this fucking job, they can have it. It's no great joy to me.
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Just a second, Mr. President.
Will somebody find out what's going on?!
Hey. Nice tie.
Don't get too attached.
You're my hero, Carl.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
A murder. On the reservation.
Again. Figures, man.
James Looks Twice?
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
Oh, yeah -- right.
Who are you?
You're a wise-ass. Ray check his wallet.
Tell him, Ray.
-- did you understand me when I said that --
No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.
Who the fuck is he?
I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
I got one up on ya.
Go ahead.
Cooch. You're my hero.
I gave it back to her.
Jesus, I don't know. You tell me. You're the Indian.
A long way from home. You be careful out there.
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
Thanks, Cooch.
And get rid of the dog.
Yes.
-- never mind Eagle Bear. We've got Jimmy nailed. Let's go!
Cuz I want New York.
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
No way, Cooch.
Let the press through.
After we've completed our investigation.
Watch out!
You're steppin' on sign.
-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
Medicine. As in medicine man?
He said he doesn't know.
Why should I tell you.
Because he was talking to me.
He saw an owl.
Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
Cuz you're a cop.
Not no more.
What are you talking about?
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
Crow Horse, listen --
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
What do you mean?
Nothin'. Forget it.
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
What the hell do you want me to do?!
Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.
What?
You go to the council fire. I'm going back in.
Bullshit, let's get outta here,
We're going for The Stronghold.
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
Go ahead, Ray.
Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over.
Never mind.
I read, Cooch.
Ray. What's your 20?
I'm on my way back in. Over.
Mister Tully.
Do you want a coffee?
No. No, no. Thank you.
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
How the hell do you know?
Red Deer Table! What's with you, man?
That's a big comfort to me.
I could be, too.
How so?
And on to a bigger one with you?
Yeow!
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
It would have been really embarrassing!
How did you know this was my car?
I saw one.
You saw a MiG 21?
It's classified.
Where were you?
On his six.
Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
Two miles.
Two meters.
You know. The finger.
You let me make a fool of myself.
What would?
And far too aggressive.
It is combat. Every second counts.
Yes. I'll give you that!
Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
Evan... or Maverick.
I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
Uh hum.
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
What plane.
I'm different.
I'm starting to sense that now.
Make what?
Anything.

You're an animal.
That's true. What are you?
It's not suffering anymore.
About as much as they think about killing me.
What?
Thanks very much.  Care for some suchi?.
Where?
You want to go ballistic?
And now I want you.
You always get what you want?
I don't know yet.
Anything.
In that order?
Well no...inverse order.
I'm still second best.
I don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies.
. Yeah!
Doesn't it ever bother you?
Why, what's gonna happen?
Where'd you get it.
Pawn shop. What's to eat?
I'm fine.
This is it, then.
What?
I was flying...my responsibility.
That's what you get flight pay for.
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
What do you want?
I want it back.
What?
Yesterday.
Hardly ever.
I sit. I think. I play games.
What kind of games?
I like to play "reality".
How does it go?
True.
Now?
Take something off.
Off me or off you?
That's up to you.
And that's one!
Who's gonna win?
I was, later.
I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
Well what?
Well?
Yes sir.
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
F-14's sir.
Tomcats?
Yes sir!
No sir! But you have to be ready.
Remember one thing.
Sir?
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
Maintaining course. Straight for Mustang.
YEAH, COUGAR?
I'M UPSIDE DOWN. I KNOW IT. I'M GONNA EJECT.
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
What is he doing?
He's pissing me off!
He better be kidding!
Lordy!  Eyeball to Asshole. Hope nobody burps!
These guys are getting on my nerves.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
What is?
What?  What is it?
Were upside down!
You're crazy. We're level.
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
No! Now we're inverted!
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
TELL HIM, WILL YOU TELL HIM? OUR INSTRUMENTS ARE OKAY.
Saving them some paperwork.
Since when did you care about paperwork?
Don't tell me okay. Do it!
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
AND HE'S GUNNING.
Roger, I've got it.
I know!
Rudder's left, stick's forward.
Swell! Passing ten thousand!
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
I can recover. Hold on!
Okay.
I'm not losing it again!
280, 290, 300 knots.
You go. I'm staying with it.
I'm gonna go! THREE...TWO...ONE...
Just relax.
Is it the plane?
The plane is fine.
Is it you?
But I have to!
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
What do you want?
What do I want?
What do you want?
Any more MiGs?
On what?
Oh...I'll think of something.
Got you here.
Below the hard deck doesn't count. You guys are the second team, aren't you?
The list is long, but distinguished.
So's my Johnson.
This is Maverick.
Who's your pilot?
Tom Kazansky.
No shit. The Iceman....
Mister to you.
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
Could use a dash more jet fuel.
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
Gotta keep track of the competition.
Look, Ma, top of the world!
What?
Nothing. Let's just go fight.
Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose on!
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
I want him!
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
Time to go.
Let's go. Eject.
Come on. I died enough for one night.
They should have warned you about that one.
Pulled left, rolled out, underneath.
What now?
He won again.
SHIT!!
STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.
GET LOST!
YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN.
NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
LOOK OUT!
GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
You saved our lives. You did it!
We did it.
Figured out what?
Nope.
Need a hint?
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
But you continued to fight.
Tell me one thing.
So have I.
Some guys never get it back.
Three guesses.
What the hell you doing?
Helping him in.
Didn't everybody?
Bad?
How's it goin', Coog?
Me?
The wings..
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
Yes sir.
A good man. Good flyer.
For the same reason you are.
Oh, you mean the thrill!
All right.
Goose is dead.
I know. I was there.
No bother.
My wife's house.
Or you can quit.
I don't know...
You may not think so, but you are.
He was by the book, all the way.
Not something they tell dependents.
He ain't got five kids to feed.
Over there man.
You got the job.
What was that?  An accident?
Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.
The Last Resort.
You're getting off to an early start.
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
Man don't know if he's been to Mars or not
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
Take me to the hotel.
The Last Resort!  Quick!
But maybe you can change all that.
I think my grampa might be here.
Hey, I got four kids to feed.
Who are you?
Would you like the same suite?
Identification?
Thank you.
Fuck you.
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
It's about goddamn time.
You better get down here.
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
Why not?
We haven't implanted it yet.
Nice to meet you.
Eight years.
Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
Hetero.
Brunette.
Slim, athletic, voluptuous?
Sleazy...and demure.
Forty-one A, Ernie.
I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.
At Rekall.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
Swallow this.
Any news of Quaid?
Not since you lost him.
Where?
There!  The woman!
Arrest that woman!
O.K., everybody pull out!
Where's Kuato?
On his way.
You tell me.
I don't know.
C'mon!
Melina!
Oh, Rekall.
Yeah.
Well don't.
Harry!
You went to Rekall, remember?
I did?
No, Harry, I'm already late...See you tomorrow.
Come on, let's go have that drink.
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Unh-uh, pal.  You've got yourself mixed up with somebody else.
Up to the right.
I've got Quaid.
Level 2.  Galleria.
What is it?
Split up.  Find him.
Up!
Come on!
What the hell is this?
How did I get in this taxi?!
The door opened.  You got it.
Drive!  DRIVE!!
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
Quit while you're ahead.
Thanks for taking Johnnycab.
Mmmm.....
Lori, I don't believe it...You're jealous of a dream!
Nobody.
I don't know.
Tell me!
But I'm always home by morning.
You know I do.
Yeah, sweetheart?
Let's do it.
Do what?
Move to Mars.
And you believe him?
All right, forget about it.
There's lots nicer places than Mars.
I'm late.
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
Let me finish!
I'm not your wife.
The hell you're not.
It was implanted by the Agency.
And falling in love?
Implanted.
It's time you found out.
I'm here at Rekall.
Good to see ya. Right this way.
Right.  Mars.
That a problem?
Okay, you're the boss -- Mars it is.
As real as any memory in your head.
Come on, don't bullshit me.
What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
Let me go!
I think it's still hungry.
I guess he didn't.
What are you talking about?
Hauser left me a note.
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
Not any more.
Don't be ridiculous.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
I'm not falling for it.
If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
Jump!
I used to model for 'em, why?
I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.
Oh, since when?
You two-faced-bastard.
The reactor.
What reactor?!
The one in the mine!
Aliens built it.
Aliens?!
It's just up ahead.
I gave you?
What?
...Who are you?
Ready as we'll ever be.
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
Hang on, Burt.  The bastards are up to something.
That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
Cannon fuse.
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
My cannon.
Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
I think I scared it!
Damn it!  They'll sink this rig just like a boat!
Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.
Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!
No.  We go straight.
Could we make it to the mountains?
You're really leaving, huh?
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
Hell you did.  Your turn.
Has a lot of rain.
Do not talk to the driver.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
The new one!  That's supposed to be a girl!
Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.
Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
Adios, bridge!
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground.
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
You're hung up again.
I am not!
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
Fifteen lousy bucks.
A man who plans ahead.
Screw you.  For all you know they could <u>fly</u>.
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
Sons of bitches!
Yeah.  Where's your truck?
Little sons of bitches.
Okay, now, how far's your truck?
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.
Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna help you.
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
Like hell you are.
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
I don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there.
Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
It's out last one.  We can't kill them all.
I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
Not yet, not yet...
No ties.
You are so full of shit...
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
Yeah, Val.
They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
Ah, but consider this, if we don't finish the roof, we can looks at that sky all the time.
It's...gone...!
Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.
God, what a stink!
Okay, ten dollars.
You okay?
Let's assume that it is.
Yeah.  One, two, three...
You guys do all the odd jobs.
LET'S DO IT!
An hour after you picked it up!
I know about Esparza.
He was your snitch.
That-a-boy. Hospital.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
No it is not, Mr. Dowd.
It most certainly is.
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
In other words, seven times out of a hundred, you're wrong!
I have to talk to your brother.
The hell you do. At this hour?
Let go of my hair.
Where's the nearest hospital?
Bellevue. Straight up First --
So noted.
Complain to the Bar Commission.
Sustained.
Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
I can describe it.
Oh really?
How can you remember that?
I didn't take my eyes off it!
No further questions.
Not at all --
Your Honor, the witness' response was non-responsive... I ask you to strike it from the record...!
You fucking swear to shut up!
Damn right I'm right.
-- an angel dust dealer --
Look -- I'm tired, I'll see you in the morning, Eddie.
With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.
What other case?
Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.
A Complaint Follow-Up form.
What, the lunatic who --
"Cecil Stipe." Find it.
I didn't ask for a closing argument.
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
Roger Baron.
-- What?
You sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.  Nice.
...What do you mean?
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
Let's get a cab.
-- Roger -- ?
What's Art Esparza?
I followed her from the courthouse.
I've seen this picture before.
Everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right!
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
...For ten years, now.
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
It hasn't been that long.
Kitty, where exactly do you place the microphone to catch the most incriminating moans?
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
I'm kicking myself, Eddie... Right out of here.
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
Right.
You don't drink "booze".
You do.
I don't need sleep!
That's right.
Figures.
Racist asshole came at me.
Exactly what happened then?
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
Maybe... because someone's afraid.
Afraid of what?
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
-- About what?
About Chinatown. What went down.
What went down?
You tell me, man.
No. You tell me, Shu.
How can I tell you what I don't know!
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
"No," what?
It's okay, Eddie.
Jimmy Chin? Was that self-defense too?
By trusting me. Shit, man...
See-cil.
Thank you, Mr. Stipe.
Mr. Rabin has no right to --
Don Reynard.
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
You're my only problem, Ed. What does it take to make you go away?
-- in a context.
I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
If I were sitting where I normally sit, I would say "Calls for speculation."
And who were the detectives who assisted you, Mr. Reynard?
The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
I hope so, Mr. Reynard.
So what'd this guy do? Snitch off a dealer?
-- Every word.
Shouldn't one of us...?
No -- leave him be. It's better for everyone.
I'm Roger Baron. I work with Edward Dowd.
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
Chuckie OD'd, Mrs. Esparza. He's dead.
-- Roger --
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.
For control of the prison drug trade?
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
What is your rank within La Compania?
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
And why was an exception made?
Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
And you b-believe that.
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
NO! GOD, NO...
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
I want you to kill for me.
Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
Here he comes.
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
The stuff we got last night.
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
Let's ditch this place and party.
Out back in our morgue.
We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
Well, where are you going?
I am going over here.
God damn, you people are confusing.
Can you tell me what their names were?
Yep, it sure is.
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
What?
ALBERT?
I'm up to speed, Stanley.
Stanley, I heard all about it.
No, sir, we did not.
Someone else has it now.
That would indicate that it's the future.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
Where am I? And how can I leave?
You are here and there is no place to go...
Sorry to hear it.
He didn't suffer.
No.
No.  Ask Irene over there.
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
Code, I've heard a lot about this.
Shorthand. Really?
We're heading into a difficult situation.
How do you figure?
What do you mean?
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
I see. He does talk loud.
That's what I heard.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
It's late, Sam.
It's not late, it's early. Really early.
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
She must have known someone.
I'll get my kit.
She's wearing a ring.
Yes, he is like a clown.
I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
Noooo...
The usual, 9:15.
He probably wanted to drive over.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
Oh god, Laura.
James is very sweet and very gorgeous.
Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
Of course...
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
No, I want to smoke.
You want a muffin?
Donna, you are a muffin.
No, you're the muffin.
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
Come on, Laura. I'm your best friend.
Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
You mean Fred and Ginger?
Dancing.
YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
Not you, Donna, not you.
Laura, I am your friend.
No.
WE got it back, that's all.
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
Why do you do it, Laura?
What'll it be?
Fill 'er up.
You got it.
I haven't got it yet.
Yep...  Yes...  It is.
I did? I didn't see anything.
Yeah... look in here. Look at it from this angle.
Bob.
But Bob isn't real.
The pages are gone. That's real.
Oh, yes... yes...
Did you make me a tape?
I already made you two tapes.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
I am The Muffin.
And what a muffin you have.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
We're on our way, Baby.
Let's go all the way.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
It does matter. We're in love.
We were supposed to be together.
How can I be together if I'm not together?
Not now.
I can't tonight.
What's going on?
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
You know it and I know it.
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
Oh, Laura.
"Oh, Laura..."
You mean the ones you pity.
What?
When he finds out.
What?
Bobby killed a guy.
See what?
No.
Hiking?
No.
You'd think so.
Sex?
You're getting warmer.
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
We throw away the whole head.
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
What?
Sure you do, it's good for you.
Good night, sweetheart.
Fine.
School?
...school's fine...
Dad...
A friend from school.
A special friend?
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
Yes.
Yes.
Stay away from me.
I always thought you knew it was me.
Look at this finger here.
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
Who am I?
I don't know.
That's right.
Nothing, I chickened out.
What did you say?
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
There's no one here.
Norma, are you alright?
Abrams...
I'm fine.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Nothing.
How good's your intelligence?
Very good.
The man's an ambulance chaser...
...tell me about this case.
We thought it was just.
You thought it was just.
Yes.
Yes. It would be.
And no one will know the truth.
What is the truth?
Mickey told me to come back to work.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
It looks that way.
You know what that would mean?
...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told you that.
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
What does it mean?
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
I wouldn't do it.
You would not...?
No.
Just now...
You've just said you signed it.
You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
Neurology?
No.
Orthopedics?
I'm just an M.D.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I know of him.
How is that?
Through, through his book.
What book is that?
Meth... Methodology and Technique...
...of Anesthesiology?
How old are you?
I am seventy-four years old.
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
I'm on the staff of...
Objection.
Frank Galvin. We've met before.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Your Honor...! Your Honor...
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
You may step down.
Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just tell the truth.
Say it.
I was her doctor.
When she...
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr. Marx, of course...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
We went to Code Blue...
'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Tell me one?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
Well, we...
We just...
I understand.  I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
No, you did fine.
No. No. Thank you. You go home.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
The Doctors were not negligent.
I... um...
Why is that?
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
I am on the staff of...
Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
It's a common medical term.
And you wrote that...
Yes? Galvin, right?
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
...and you're going to do that?
Why?
...that's perfectly all right.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
Hi. How are you doing?
You live in the neighborhood?
Four. You're great with these kids.
Mrs...
Yes.
Yes...
Kathy Costello. That's my maiden name.
What did she say?
Yes.
A single hour.
Yes.
Why is that?
I was held up.
Thank you for seeing me.
That's perfectly all right.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
I had a witness disappear on me.
Ready, your Honor.
Defense...?
Mr. Concannon...?
Overruled...
Exception!
Still looking.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
The TV didn't work.
What Hotel are you staying at?
And what are you? A cop?
I'm a lawyer.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Yes. It was, actually.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
You just got lucky.  D'you eat yet? Come on.
Maybe I can do something right.
Is this a bad time.
...and is that serious?
No, no, I'm just...
I've got to work.
Yes.
Isn't there something you...
That's what I am.
I... do you want me to leave?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Is there going to be a later...?
If I don't 'grow up...'
Stop pressuring me...
No... no...
No.
I don't have a goddamned idea.
I have to talk to you.
Mr. Alito, please.
Let me talk to Mickey.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
From the magazine?
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
How come you're calling me from...?
This is Miss Costello...?
Yes. Price...
Kathy Price.
We find that your subscription lapsed...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
You know what happened.
Nothing happened.
I didn't do it, Mister.
Who are you protecting, then?
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
Then why don't you testify?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
It's locked?
...I'm sure you do...
...You saw her?
Yes. Yes, I have.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
Where is he?
Yeah.
That's for sure, Frank.
Come on. Let's get a drink.
Don't touch anything.
...I'm going to need your help...
What?
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
You got a good memory, Franky.
I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
I'm going to get laid.
Oh shit, what's today?
Today is Tuesday. What?
I can't talk now.
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I'm swell.
That's right.
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
What difference can that make...? All right...
What did she do?
The broad has disappeared...
We got to talk.
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
She did?
I just saw her.
In New York?
Yes.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
...of the procedures...
Yes, the roving nurse...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
What happened in those three minutes...?
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
Huh. And why is that?
So far you're great. You got a cigarette?
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!
We'd be in all the papers!
Hey, how about that!
Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
The same thing that happened on our Pacific Coast.  Anything from them yet?
I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...
There's nobody left around here now.
But I think I know where she'll be....
Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
What's he like?
Like...ah...
Automobile ignitions are insulated.
You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
Sure...get in!
It's gone now.
Where are we?
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
I have no close folks.  My parents died when I was a kid.
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
If they're mortal, they must have mortal weaknesses.  They'll be stopped -- somehow!
It was...  ...one of them!
What was it like?
We're right in a nest of 'em! ... I've got to get a look at them.
Maybe ...  Maybe they want to take us alive.
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
How'd you guess?
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
Have you got a pocket compass?
We better get word to the authorities and --  Look!
I believe we can get a lead from their anaemic blood.
So is the town, I notice!
I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.
It's always been a good persuader.
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.
If they're more advanced than us, they should be nearer the Creator for that reason!
D.O. to number three..come in.
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
How would I know...!
Everything human don't have to look like you and me....
Welcome to California!
He's very excited about it.
The nightmares.
Sort of a trial balloon.
Come on.  Kids love horror.
And I...I've got other things happening.
I'm sure we can match any offer.
I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
Like weird calls, by any chance?
I'm sorry.  At least we're in on piece.
You get any sleep last night?
More or less.  Dylan, time to get dressed.  I'm late.
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
Hasn't been another call, has there?
Maybe you should tell me your dream.
48 hours.  Back before you know it.
Chase, you'd better come home.
Like Freddy.
Heather, has there been another call?
Don't speed, Chase.  It's not...
No.
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
You don't understand.  If Dylan falls asleep,then...
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
You have a fever, sweetie?
What?
Rex?  Who's Rex?
I like this story.
No.  Tonight.  It's important!
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
Your bed?
No, I don't think so.  You just have to...pray, or reach...
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
Can you come with me in my dreams?
Home, that's right.
Here.
A story?
I'm fine.
I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
Yeah...how'd you know?
That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
Steady...
You got it.  What's happening?
What are you talking about?
Fred Krueger did it.
Yeah, sure.
Yes?
Is Chase Porter your husband?
Yes.
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
I want to see for myself.
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
The car's no there yet?
Listen, dammit.
I just can't.
Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
Captured?  How?
Then what is he doing?
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
Do you let your child watch your movies?
My child?  No...but...
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Coffee'd be nice.
Me too.
It's time these boys saw some real blue water.
Yep.
Your father?
You sound so sure.
I am about this.
I can take it.
We were idealists.
He has a lot of hurt inside him.
Claiming their place in the world.
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
Give me some time to blow the man down...
Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
Give me some time to Blow the man down!
Yes, Sir.
We've got weather moving in from the west.
Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!
Yes sir.
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
How old are you, son?
Fifteen.
Thank you.
You came back, Tod.  You came back.
It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
What do you mean?
Yes sir.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
To take a piss.
Believe what?
Her name.  Bregitta.  It's poetry.
Yeah.  How'd you do.
Congratulations.
What about you?
Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
What?
Anonymous.
I thought this was your dream come true.
That's not why he's sending me.
Why then.
What's the difference?
You only hurt yourself you know?
I guess.
Is it true Phil?
I gotta go.
I'm pissin' fire man.
Yes.
Passport?
Look, I just better go.
I know you will.
Maybe it's an air raid.
Fine.
Good.
It doesn't matter.  Really.  I'm just sorry you got chewed out.
Ya know... "It".
How do you know?  They might.
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
Kennet Square, PA.  'Mushroom capital of the world'.
My dad.
It works?
I couldn't.
I can't make it out?
What are you talking about.
Speak up boy!
Unfurl the squares!
All stop on the engine.
It was my fault.  I slipped.
Sometimes it gets exciting out here.
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
Sir...?
Close the door.  Sit down.
Of what?
It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
I don't know.
So is violating international law.
But you invited is aboard.
That is unfortunate.  We'll have to take him with us.
Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
Take good care of my son.
Well, you never can tell these days, can you?
Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
I should be eating with the crew.
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
Why are you here?
Oh, really?
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once?
Yes.  I do.
You're officer of the watch, George.
We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
A padlock.
She's Cuban.
Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
Why'd you jump?
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
Like you'd know what to do with one.
Trust me donut.  I know.
What?  Come on...
Okay donut.  Whatever you say.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
Read on, young John.  Read on. College boards are coming.
It seems we're short on singers.
Outer.
What's that?
No.  Bring him on deck with the others.
Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.
No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
What?
No, Phil.  It's a mammal.
It hurts too much to care.
About yourself?
About anything.
Long enough.
You've gotta be kidding?
But, they don't speak English.
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
No way Phil.  Not like this.
Then keep your mouth shut.
You already have.  Now go on.  Do it.
What?
Up you go.  Right now.
Sorry won't cut it.
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
I can't be sure.
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
May I ask you something?
The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
Then what are you trying to say then?
What's that supposed to mean?!
Artie? That you, Artie?
How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
Why? He's right in the groove.
Real soon... I'll be makin' the swap tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.
Y'all take American Express?
Yessir.
How old are you?
Twenty.
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
You was in the Marines, huh?
Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
That'd be fine, Bobby.
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
No, haven't heard of it.
New Orleans, huh?... We was just there.
No.
You an indian?
Ready for another?
Why not?
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
She really say she was pregnant?
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
Like takin' candy from a fuckin' baby...
That's right... Take one of these.
What is it?
Told ya I would. You still riled?
You still screwing sixteen-year-olds in the ass?
You heard from Reggie?
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.
Used to.
What'd you say?
No, of course.
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
Maybe he'll get a little nervous, but who gives a shit?
What's the name of it?
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
You hitched yet?
No sir...
Whattaya do there?
Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
But I am also with the government.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
Only if necessary, of course, and only in my own country. 
We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
Come here.
Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
In many capacities.
Why not? How was the fishin'?
Hasta siempre.
The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it.
I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
See ya downstairs.
What I made you do, mama?
You ain't actin', mama.
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
Thinkin' a second, baby.
Why, honey?
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
What you have to get personal about so quick? All I mean is you could possibly read a book.
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yeah?
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
Yeah, I suppose. But you know somethin' baby, hair does make a difference.
You up for that?
What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.
What kinda trash talk is that?
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
What's that, honey?
Let's get fed, sweetheart. The light's fadin' fast.
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
It's just another case, Sailor.
What's that, peanut?
You certain?
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
Who do?
You do.
Who knows, baby?
He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
Do me a favor, Sailor? Don't pick up no more hitchers, okay?
We'll find out in a hurry.
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
Under a hundred.
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
Yeah, I'm here.
You upset with me?
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
I don't know... Looks like clothes.
SAILOR!!!
You think she's gonna make it?
No radio or TV...
Fan works.
Now what?
Yeah?
The only one.
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Yeah?
Come sit by me.
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
Few beers is all. Feelin' any better?
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
You talk to 'im some?...
So where'd you say you was?
Went with Bobby.
Uh-huh?
Let's leave here.
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
I mean tomorrow.
Rather be in El Paso than Big Tuna.
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
He's the kind liked it.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
What makes sense, is all.
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
Mama, Sailor's in deep trouble here. I just can't leave him.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Course I am, mama.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Got any plans?
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
What if I asked you not to?
Wouldn't make any difference.
HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.
And jus when my baby's out on some Texas road with a killer.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
Santos... It isn't.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
What do you want me to do about it?
Yes.
Get rid of him?
Yes... Get rid of him.
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
That's your business... I don't care how.
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Shoot him.
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
Where? In the leg?
No.
Where?
In the head.
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
Through the forehead?
Yes.
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
What?
Someone's gonna see us.
Santos... You kill that Sailor, otherwise he's gonna turn my baby against me.
Shhhhhh...  Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now...
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
You really are one dumb asshole.
Life is unpredictable.
Well?...
I ain't heard of nothin'.
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
So I hear.
He's right, you look horrible.
You're welcome.
Your wife.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
You're stoned.
She's still a transvestite.
Mm.
Isn't she?
I just mean...
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
She left me. Crabs.
Left you...? Who? Emily?
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
I know. He started it Fall semester.
He finished it Winter Break.
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
Shut up and drink.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
He lives with his mother.
And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
He heard everything we were saying.
Yes.
Hit your brakes.
Just go around him.
Where would we go?
Shit.
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
His parents.
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
It's a little late to call Admissions.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
So sensitive.
Ye-es?
The Chancellor's here? Now?
Evidently.  Coming!
Find the jacket.
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas.
Don't touch it.
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
The hood jumper?
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
Call it a hunch.
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
He was never able to reproduce them.
In a sense.
Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...
No. But I don't think that matters.
I peeked.
Excuse me?
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
You must be mistaken.
Bullshit.
You did.
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
How long have you been having them?
The last month maybe.
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
And your wife left you.
Is that in my chart?
Actually, it was her husband's dog...
Better luck next time.
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
No. There's no one here.
I have to see her. As soon as possible.
Who's got a gun?
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch.
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
Stop calling me Vernon.
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
Just what? Doing a little dusting?
No. Sara, you don't understand...
No! What gave you that idea?
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
Sounds like a good one.
It's not bad.
A little.
It's colder in there.
You're right.
This is worth it.
Really?
Really.
Like the lady herself.
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on me.
He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
Miss Sloviak's.
She is. Ah. Here we go...
What's he saying?
You're welcome.
I put you on the floor.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
Sure.
Who?
The guy on the phone.
That's a big book you're writing.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
Blocked.
Hm.
Well done, James.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
So where have you been staying?
The bus station.
I don't know...  Me.
Hm.
Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
Yeah, well, actually...
Maybe...
Colon cancer.
Jesus, James. Wow.
Carvel.
I never heard of it.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
When we fall, we fall hard.
Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
That's right. That one.
How can you tell?
You can see the outline of a butt.
It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's --  Who said anything about girlfriend?
Not you. Your talent.
The hell I am.
I eat.
When?
When nobody's looking.
Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
Parents? They're not my parents. They're my grandparents. My parents are dead.
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
In the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.
I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
Well, let's see if we can keep that from happening.
Yes, James.
I think so... What about you?
Me? Sure. Why?
Just checking.
James'll know about George Sanders.
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
That strikes me as odd.
Grady!
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
Who does?
But where? I need the street.
It beats 'What's your major?'
No, it's not that, it's...
Chancellor.
I got the message you called too.
Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
All right. This morning --
I'm pregnant.
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
She's left before...
Hm.
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
Caps.
You got me.
I love you, Grady.
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
You heard? How?
I'm kidding. Hello?
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
That... and you.
James Leer.
And the jacket?
Grady.
Of course, I'm sure. Ah, Christ, the puberty police are back.
And what do you think you might have said?
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
He told me.
And what did you say?
I said it didn't sound like you.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
I know.
And you're old.
Dozens. It's very sad.
Does he still love you?
It didn't come up.
I know, but sometimes...
Lucky guess.
It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
He's still barking at me. He's blind.
I'm your man.
Sure it is.
Tony. Now that I'm home.
Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
What's that?
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
Yes?
It's Grady, Walter.
Grady?
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
This is important.
Oh?
I... I...
What is it, Grady?
I'm in love with your wife.
Excuse me?
Sara. I'm in love with her.
I don't know. It might be...
Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you?
Her husband.
Taking the long way home.
Hey, Professor Tripp.
Only when I'm working.
As a heart attack.
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
I was thinking of you.
And?
I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just... want to know where I stand.
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
Horses, right. Vernon something...  Hardapple.
No, the dog.
Just kidding.
That's all right. We'll find him.
No, I'm going ho --
Just a few then. The big ones.
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
I doubt it, darling.
If he's happy...  I'm happy.
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
I told her all my relatives are good- looking.
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
Foreman now.
No shit.
Five years.
Beautiful. How's business?
I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
K through sixth.
I was just thinking of... the noise.
I like the noise.
What?
Annette? She's good... tense.
When can I see her?
I'm working on it.
Is it because of Anna?
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
This little table is one heavy bitch.
Huh?
It's a nice table.
Then what? What?!
The birthday party.
What's that?
Annette will see you.
When?
Soon.
Next week? The week after?
Early July.
It's not what you think.
Isn't it?
I'm just talking, man.
I know. I'm just saying I understand.
Nothing.
Ask me. Ask me anything.
Did you ever... Do you have feelings for Anna?
I mean... feelings.
Birds.
There's a million birds here.
In that birch tree is a nest.
Is that right?
I don't like starlings.
Why not?
The mother sure has her hands full.
Their sound is quite musical.
How does it sound?
It's hard to describe.
Try.
I can't.
I bet you can.
It's a bright sound.
That was terrific.
You should hear the bird.
You live around here?
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
Were you watching me?
Do you come here often?
My daddy likes me home before dark.
It's good to listen to your daddy.
Not yet.
It's my bird book.
I have friends.
Well... not in the common way.
Cop.
Have a seat.
I have no idea.
I think you do.
Why don't you just tell me?
Then you won't mind if I look around.
Got something to hide?
Doesn't everybody?
I could get a search warrant.
If you could, you would have brought one today.
Yeah.
Who said I wanted to buy it?
Okay.
What?
Yes.
Do you believe in them?
No.
The one with the ax?
What?
The girl.
Know what?
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
I went to bed around seven.
I could take you downtown.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
What's with the boxes?
You're a cop. Figure it out.
I'd say you're moving.
It's a free country, isn't it?
Yes.
I count my blessings.
Well, I guess I'll be seeing you.
I'm adjusting okay.
And your new apartment?
Apartment's okay.
Are you taking your medication?
It gives me headaches.
But you are taking it?
Yeah.
You are in.
What?
Lovers' quarrel?
If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
Can I ask how old you are?
No you're not.
Do you have many friends?
How come?
Banished... yeah.
Yes?
Are you sure?
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
That's okay... doesn't matter.
Ms. Kramer.
Yes you can, Robin.
Your daddy will always love you.
How do you know?
I know because... it's just something I know.
Robin, listen to me.
Yes?
I don't mind.
You should go home.
Can't I stay a little longer?
It's getting dark. Go home.
Will I see you again?
The job's okay.
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
You seem a little hostile today.
That was a joke.
That's right.
No way.
Why not?
Ev-i-dence.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
Of course.
It was just an idea.
Bad idea.
That's right.
You think reflection is good.
It's very good, indeed.
How's that?
No fucking way.
Then think about it.
I'm still thinking about it.
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
You have no feelings for your niece?
Have to talk about something.
I'm not that crazy.
Do you think you're crazy?
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
Is that what you are angry about?
We have a few more minutes.
I mean, when will I be normal.
We have a lot of work to do.
Will I ever be normal?
I couldn't say.
You couldn't say.
I'm afraid not.
How do you define it?
I don't.
How do they know?
What is your idea of being a Jew?
I know --
You don't know!
I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
What did you think would happen?
I don't know.
What did you want to happen?
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
I want you to calm down.
I want to talk about it now.
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
Sorry.
Please don't do it again.
I said I was sorry.
That's not a helpful answer.
That's my answer.
What?
To relax.
I'm relaxed.
Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
In your mind, Walter. Take your time.
I see my sister.
Sorry.  Where is she?
In my bedroom, sleeping.
Where?
In my bed too.
How old are you and your sister?
We're little kids.
But roughly, how old?
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
I want you back in your chair! Right now!
All right.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
I'm only asking questions.
Yes.
I was six years old!
I meant later... when you two took naps.
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
I smelled her hair. That's it. I just liked smelling her hair.
I feel... okay.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic.
I'm all right.
It's fucking freezing out here.
What picture?
I'm talking about you.
Me?
Yeah, you.
Most women wouldn't choose it.
Guess I'm not like most women.
I'm just quiet.
They're all assholes.
I thought you were a dyke.
What do you think?
K through sixth.
Doesn't it get noisy?
What about them?
You're damaged.
Yeah?
I get that impression.
So... what's your dark secret?
Why do you want to know?
Don't you think I should know before we have sex?
What?
Not tonight.
You're still here.
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
You think I have a problem?
Do you?
It's been a while since...
Since you've had sex?
Maybe later.
How about in the morning.
I thought I'd stay the night.
What for?
Is that all?
Hi.
Because I like you.
Yeah.
I molested little girls.
Molested little girls?
Yeah.
Twelve years in prison is no joke.
It's not what you think.
How young?
Twelve years in prison?
Get your kicks somewhere else.
Hey, I'm not --
Depraved? My mistake.
Walter.
Yes! I want to know.
Why young girls, Walter?
They seduce you?
I was always the one seduced.
You really believe that?
No. That's what I used to tell myself.
And what do you tell yourself now?
Nothing. It's over.
Bullshit.
What?
Being here, with me.
I know.
The percentages --
Which brother did this?
All three -- in chronological order.
You must hate your brothers.
I love my brothers.
No you don't.
Not ever?
Not ever.
Us seeing each other.
I'm not scared.
Neither am I.
Maybe you should be.
Live together.
Move in with me.
I think it's a fucking good idea.
I've got problems.
Who doesn't?
Guess that makes you pretty special.
That's not what I meant.
What's it look like?
You're such an asshole.
I'm not scared.
Prove it.
Do what?
Sneak up behind me like that.
Why's it always my fucking problem?
Nothing.
Do you want to talk about it?
I need a shower.
Yeah.
Fucking liar.
Not when they fly.
I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
Piece of cake, baby.
Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!!
No way that could just be seawater.
I'm alright, I'm dealing.
Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
How deep's the drop-off here?
Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.
Hey, you okay?
I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
Not for long.
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
That must be it.
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
What do you think he saw?
I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!
Chill out, Lindsey!!
It's trying to communicate.
Now what?
Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
Yeah.  So sue me.
Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
They'll come out after us.
Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.
Calm down, Bud.
I don't know how!
We've only got one suit.
FUCK LOGIC!!
WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
Tell me later.
Hi, lady.
'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
I've been better.  Next time it's your turn, okay?
Who then?
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
Let's go, guys.
Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
God, I hate that bitch.
Yeah, well you never should have married her then.
Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
Everything is.
Do we just leave him there?
Why bring it here?
Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
Meet me in the moonpool.  Move fast.
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
Yuh?
I can't... make it... podner.
Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
Turn it up, bozo.
Give me that!!
Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Wilhite, anything?
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?
What's you depth, Cab Three?
Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
Check this out.
Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.
He's hallucinating badly.
Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
She'll wait.
Fine. Can't you see so yourself?
A little more so this time.
I'm thirsty.
This one is gorgeous.
Then why don't you try it on?
I'm certainly not going to swim across.
We'll send the raft back to you.
Four or five days.
You already know what they are.
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
That must be Basiluzzo.
Well, what?
More so than the shark?
There's no comparison.
That seems to apply to you also...
Oh, no... please... not here.  It looks too dangerous.
And why haven't they left each other?
Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.
No.
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
Yes, very much so.
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Occasionally, but always with affection.
Then I'll go with you.
Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...
But then when will we see each other?
Me... I... I... Please leave me alone.
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
Then why do you say them?
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
I don't know about that. And then, who's interested in beautiful things nowadays?
What! Get married?
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
Yes, yes, yes, yes... Right away...
Okay. In a few minutes.
Nothing.
Why?
No reason why...
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore.
I'm too sleepy.
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
Tell me once more.
I don't love you.
I deserve it.
I would say he's pretty depraved.
Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a child.
Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.
But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
It was futile. We went all over.
Do you consider that a compliment?
But then why did you bother changing?
Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
What do you mean by sensible?
It means being without money.
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
But for what reason should I come there?
But why all nudes?
I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.
I detest comparisons made with oil.
You must know your third grade geography book inside out.
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella.
Really! So that you can stuff it with your geraniums.
When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.
But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal.
What is it?
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Ask her.
And where do you find the models?
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
Me... Goffredo, you're mad!  He's mad.
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
No, not like this one.
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Because this is a Chinese radio.
Unfortunately, no.
I know, I know. One thing at a time.
Well...probably at the last stop, which is Noto.
No. The owners are in Australia.
But where did you come from?
From Panarea. Why?
What boat?
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
And how come you're up so early?
They didn't seem too good.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
Lady Patrizia!
Take it easy, Raimondo. Why are you getting so impatient?
Yes. Until proven otherwise.
I would like to ask you something.
Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
You're kidding!
Then let's call it a business proposition. Something to round out your salary.
Through someone else?
Yes.
Who?
I can't say.
Why?
She'd punish me.
One of the other Sisters?
No.
Who?
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
I'm a blimp.
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
Who told you this?
It's a sin to be fat.
You've got to eat something Agnes.
No I don't... the host is enough.
Yes, of God.
Why?
I don't know.
Dear Jesus...
Why?
It made them holy.
I burnt them.
Why?
They were stained.
Say it!
What do you mean?
It's not my time of month.
Should you see a doctor?
I don't know... I don't know...
No I don't.
I just heard you.
That wasn't me.
Was it Sister Marguerite?
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
Let's talk about something else.
What would you like to talk about.
Anything... may I sit down?
Yes.
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Have you ever loved anyone?
Yes.
Who?
Everyone.
Well, who in particular?
Right now?
Uh huh.
I love you.
Who?
Oh, there are so many.
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Do you think he loves you?
Oh, I know he does.
Often?
And you like that?
Oh, yes.
Where do you meet?
In the confessional.
Would you like to talk about it?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
I don't know.
How were you sick?
Something I ate.
Did it hurt?
Yes.
Where?
Down... there.
And what did you do?
And what happened?
I got sicker.
And then what?
I fell asleep.
In the middle of all the pain?
What baby?
The baby they made up.
From their heads...
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Where'd it come from before that?
From God.
I... I don't understand.
Agnes, how are babies born?
Don't you know?
What do you mean?
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
Martha Louise Livingston.
Are you married?
No.
Would you like to be?
Not at the moment, no.
Do you have any children?
No.
Would you like some?
Why not?
I've stopped menstruating
Why do you smoke?
No questions.
What?
No... do you?
Why should I?
I don't know.
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
Oh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes ... wait a minute... Agnes slow down.
Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
Somebody told her.
I don't know.
Agnes...
You'll laugh.
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
Did your mother see angels often?
Do you?
No.
No, but I can never tell her that.
She'd get angry.
I could never be a mother.
Why not?
Because I don't want one.
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
A mistake... it was a mistake...
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
Not my fault.
What the child?
Everything... I don't have children.
Agnes...
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
Sometimes, yes.
I'm always bad.
What did you do?
I breathed!
You can tell me.
I can't.
She's dead isn't she?
She can.
How?
She watches... she listens.
Yes?
... makes me...
Yes?
And that you're stupid?
Yes.
That you're a mistake?
She says my whole body's a mistake.
Her headaches.
Oh, yes.
And then...
What?
Are you pretty?
Yes.
Agnes, you're stupid.
No I'm not.
Are you intelligent?
Yes I am.
You're a mistake.
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
As much as Mother Miriam does?
As much as God loves you.
Who am I?
Doctor Livingston.
And why am I here?
To help me.
Of what?
Of telling you.
It came out of me.
Did you know what was going to come out?
Why?
Because I was afraid.
Why were you afraid?
Because I wasn't worthy.
To be a mother?
Yes.
Why?
I can't tell you that.
Will she be angry?
She made me promise not to.
You don't like brussel sprouts?
I hate them.
We went to chapel for vespers.
Hm hmm.
Someone's following me.
Who?
Sister Marguerite I think.
What else?
A crucifix.
Do you know who put it there?
For me to get sick in.
Are you ill?
Yes.
What do you feel?
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
What do you do?
I have to throw up...
I don't know which one 
Is someone in the room with you?
No... don't hit me please...
Yes.
What did she mean?
Why?
Him.
She'd seen him too.
Where?
Yes.
Yes.
Agnes who did you see?
I hate him...
Of course you do. Who was it?
I hate him for what he did to me.
I hate him.
Agnes, who did this to you?
Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
It was alive wasn't it?
I don't remember.
H... how?
???
What?
Look into the convent records.
Sister...
Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.
Larry there's got to be something missing.
What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
You got to be crazy.
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
What about Roger? He's free.
Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
I'll have a decision by next week.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
I'll have it.
When?
Next week.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
It's your favourite...
Who are you?
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
Who are you?
I... I'm Martha, Mama.
The one up on the third floor?
Do you still go to church?
What business is it of yours..?
Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
You can call me Sister.
... Thank you.
Two packs a day.
I can beat that.
Unfiltered.
No-one.
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
Yes.
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
I haven't a clue.
What man had access to her?
None as far as I know.
Was there a priest?
Yes, but I...
What's his name?
Could there have been anyone else?
Obviously there was.
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
I believe Agnes is different.
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
No... not in the eyes of the police.
And in your eyes?
I've already told you what I thought.
That possibility never occurred to you?
And you weren't shocked?
I was appalled, just as you are now.
She stopped eating completely...
About two years before.
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
What?
Nuns... you hate nuns.
The Catholic Church...
I am...
What?
Aquittal.
How?
Oh, some time in January.
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Nothing.
Take at look at it.
Was the child full term?
Oh, Dear God...
What is it?
The sheets...
What sheets?
About what?
Your niece!
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
Listening to angels?
Do you know what she did to her?
I don't think I care to know.
She molested her!
Oh, dear God.
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
Because I didn't know... 
Oh, God.
I'd like yours too.
Don't deny it!
I haven't decided yet.
The woman's health is at stake.
Her spiritual health.
Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother, huh?
Bullshit yourself!
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
You just said...
No, because I... yeah, yeah I left the Church cause I had freckles.
Would you like one?  Huh?
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Even Christ would partake socially.
Saint Peter?
Pipe!
Right...
Mary Magdelen?
Yes I do.
Do you want to become one?
Become?  One is born a saint.
I'd like to begin.
Begin what?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
Would it stop you if I did?
Of course.
Then let's begin.
NO... no... I said leave her alone.
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
For Agnes.
You think she's a saint?
She's been touched by God, yes.
Who is he?
Why must he be anybody?
My God, you're as crazy as...
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
Don't be ridiculous.
Well give me a reasonable explanation
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
Why would I lie?
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
Hasn't she had enough?
My God, but you're determined.
Why do you insist upon pressing...
Was it you?
Did you know she was pregnant?
I didn't guess until it was too late.
For what?  An abortion?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Too late for what?
I don't know... too late to stop it.
The scandal...
You wanted that child out of the way.
No!
I left it with her and I went for help.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
Then she's a liar.
She can't remember.
What happened to the baby?
Wasn't it!
... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...
Eh?
Lay them down.
We'd be thrown out.
Your cards... lay them down... face up.
They are?
The cards... you're bank.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
I bet you're  -- sixteen!
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
Well --
Are you now?
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Just you?
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
Oh, it's all right.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What they like?
I'm a deserter, too.
Read 'em!
He'll be pulp by now.
They'll be here.
Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
Well!
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
I've made the scene.
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
Bag-snatcher.
You do - repeatedly.
Do I snore?
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
I'll have a bash.
Yeah, grotesque.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
Have I said something amiss?
It is, y'know.
Oh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all.
Yeah, she was fickle.
No, straight up.
I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
Ah well. Eh, look!
He's sulking again.
Wake up!
You crawler.
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
He hasn't.
The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
Sorry.
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
He comes from a large family.
What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?
I'll look in here again.
Come here.
It's Paul's grandfather.
Oh aye, but I thought ...
Well, what happened?
Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
Oh, sorry I spoke.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
How'd you guess?
Is it ... is it, really?
Are you pulling my leg?
Something like that.
I see.  Do you like the play?
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
Thank you.
Aye, I knew you were.
What's that mean?
Oh aye, a sledge.
No ... I wouldn't say that ... just like an actress ... you know.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
Of course.
Parading's better!
Parading?
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
A book!
I'm not wrong.
I'm going parading before it's too late!
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
That's what they want you to think. All coppers are villains.
Lip reading.
What are they saying?
Nothing good.
You see, sly villains.
Hello.
He can talk then?
I'll look after meself.
Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... 
Oh, well that's all right.  What?
Yeah ... so what?
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
That's all right then.
Clean though, isn't he?
Oh yes, he's clean all right.
For Ringo.
Hiding.
That little old man.
Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
He's got you worried, then?
Shall I?
Don't be callous.
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
Aye, before anyone stops us.
Foreign devil ...
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
You needn't bother.
Y'what?
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
You're a swine, isn't he George?
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
No ... he's must have slipped off somewhere.
Ah, go on, you swine.
We were going to do it.
Come on speedy!
Sit down, the lot of you.
I would though.
Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.
Hi, our lot!
Aye, let's try the dressing room.
You've got a midnight matinee.
Now, look here, Norm ...
Hello.
Oh you are, I know you are.
No, I'm not.
You are.
I'm not, no.
Well, you look like him.
Oh yes.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
Is it?
Aye, but you know him well.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
That's what you tell me.
What have you heard?
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
Is it? Is it really?
Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
Aah, shurrup, misery!
Oh, leave off!!!
Temper! Temper!
Since you ask, yes.  Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.
He'll get over it.
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
Don't exaggerate.
Aren't we ...
No, we're not!
Someone put it on me.
Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
It's not my fault.
I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
Well, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ... 
Paul's grandfather.
Down the ... er ...
Oh, down the ... er ...?
Yeah, down the ... er ...
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
Nerves.
I know, that's the trouble.
Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
I'll set John on you!
Oh, anything you say, Paul.
Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
Is that you, Roby?
Yeah, it's you all right.
Kill drive engines.
Or something will be able to see us.
Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
Do you remember the pyramid?
Sandy, scan the whole sky.
Dell, plot our location.
That's what I'm going to do.
Yeah.  Two hours.
Gravity?
It's... basalt.  Rock.
Then take her down.
But functioning.
Take a look.
You want to try?
Can you see anything in the hole?
Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't talk now.
Wretched.  What happened to me?
Don't you remember?
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
A voice transmission.
Play it for us, please.
Unknown.
Hold it, I can't hear a damn thing!
Has the hull been breached?
Hard to say.
Well, get started.
Right.  Talk to you.
Yeah!
What?
Not <u>they</u>... <u>he</u>...
It grows on you.
That way.
Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
Dead.
Dead!
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
Hurt!  How?
Is it alive?
The water will still recycle.
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
And when will you be ready to do that?
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
Here, let me try.
What?
The engines are fixed.
I hope not.
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
And be right back.
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
How does he breathe?
It's eating a hole in the floor!
Hell of a defense mechanism.  You don't dare kill it.
Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...
We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
Boy, that's terrific.
Ask him.
Careful, don't get under it!
I'll come with you.
How's Broussard?
He's running a fever.
Still unconscious?
Yes.
Got a better idea?
Oh my God.
Does anybody know what happened?
It's time for drastic remedies.
No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing.
Let me go first; you stay behind me.
I've completely lost their signal.
Can you get them back?
I'm trying.
What do you mean, no?
We're not going anywhere.
Three blips!  They're coming this way!
I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled.
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
I think it's fizzled out.
Hey!  what about the film?
Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?
We sure need this flamethrower.
It's not going to work.
Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?
Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
You lead.
My signal's fading.
How far?
Who knows?
Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
Can you see anything?
<u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!
Yes, thank heaven.
Is it still dripping?
It appears to have healed itself.
Maybe we could write it together.
Let's get moving with this net.
Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
Could be some kind of venom, or poison...
Yeah?
Sandy, contact traffic control.
Well, it's finally happened.
No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud layer.
Turn on navigation lights.
Engine room, what happened?
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Any microorganisms?
Not a one.  It's dead.
Anything else?
Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
Found what?
What killed it?
Oh well... you know me.
Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as the engine's fixed --
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --
Up one kilometer, Jay.
Food-storage room!
We're coming!
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
By eating our food supplies.
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing.
Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
... More spores coming.
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
What did it do to you?
I'll get you out of there.
No... don't...
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
What can I do?
Kill me...
Do you want a tablet?
Yeah...
Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
Is it dead?
Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
Wait a minute.
Thanks.
Yep...
Okay, give me the numbers.
What's happening?
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
Too many.
We're not gonna make it, are we?
What?  What's wrong?  What is it?
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
And?
Get her on-line.  Now!
You win some, you loose some.
Match it!
Nooooo!
Has anybody talked to them?
Not yet.
Do it.
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
I dunno.
What?
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
What?
Just got a reading...
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
What?
I'll come with you.
Anything you say, Mammacitta.
Yeah, I got it.
What's wrong?
I'm picking up another signal.
How?
It's alright, it's cool...
Is it still moving?
Uh-huh.
Compensate!
Looks like it.
Okay, I pull the access panel off of the console.  Insert the disk, and press the green enabling button...
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
No, not really.  More sort of the  'claustrophobic' type.
And before that?
Six month stint on Datus.
Only six?
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.
Real man' drink.
Want some?
Sure.  Do me good to stretch my legs.
Hold on...
Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?
Detour.  Other way's blocked...
Don't wait for me!
You have to...
No!
Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
'Bout five minutes.
Give me a yell is something happens.
You got it, cowboy.
And what is your name?
Phoebe.
Phoebe?
I call myself Phoebe.
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
Eddie what?
I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
I believe I will.
Just some coffee.
Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
Just like that.
It wasn't meant to be.
Just like it.
Aren't you?
Frankly - yes.
You know me better than that.
Paved with what, then?
Almost four.
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
Lloyd and I.
What else?
It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
You have no right to say such things!
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve!
I don't know what I take you for anything...
Yes, you did. You still do.
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
I can't believe my ears...
A dull cliche.
Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out.
Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?
Yes, Addison.
Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.
I don't think I'm going.
Why not?
Because I don't want to.
It's the same thing, isn't it?
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler," can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler...
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink.
Because that is what they are. Go make him happy.
You next move, it seems to me, should be toward television.
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
And too many of them are produced.
Then you've heard too.
I was there. An eyewitness.
You were there? At the play - last night?
Margo? Lunching in public?
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
Then you two must have a long talk-
Being violently ill to her tummy.
Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
Didn't you know?
Of course I knew.
It just slipped your mind.
Frankly, I don't remember.
Just slipped your mind.
To the best of my recollection, neither your name nor your performance entered the conversation.
This is Eve Harrington.
Where?
Right here. A minute ago.
That's nice.
Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
Everything... everything's so funny...
I'm a junk yard.
Like a nylon lemon peel-
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
As of this moment you're six years old...
Call me when you get in...
You're my girl, aren't you?
That I am...
Then you're crazy.
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
I get a party, don't I?
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
How is Eve? Okay?
Okay.
I love you...
I'll check with Eve...
What?
It won't play.
Cut it out.
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
Remind me to tell you about when I looked into the heart of an artichoke.
I thought you were going to be late-
When I'm guest of honor?
I had no idea you were even here.
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
For instance - you!
Nothing, really...
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
What's all over?
The audition.
You wouldn't understand.  How was Miss Caswell?
The kid. Junior.
I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
I mix what I like.
Okay. Mix.
What a body, what a voice.
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
I will not calm down!
Don't calm down.
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
Tell that to Dr. Freud! Along with the rest of it...
I've been aware of that for some time.
I'll say.
Don't be condescending.
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.
You were great.
I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
Pass me the empty bottle. I may find her... why, look. There's Rasputin.
What would you like? Texas?
Groom.
Yes, dear.
A married lady.
With the paper to prove it.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
I just wondered.
Why what?
I don't have to. I want to.
Is it the money?
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
It's only one picture deal.
So few come back...
Every day.
You didn't have to tell me.
Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
From what would I be running?
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
When I told you what every young actress should know.
You're quite a girl.
You think?
You hear all kinds of things.
No thanks, Birdie.
A diamond collar, gold sleeves - you know, picture people...
They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square...
I never played Fort Sumter.
Buy some.
Of course!
Oh, brother.
Miss Coonan...
If I haven't, I'll find something till you're normal.
Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
See you home...
Just because you can't even work a zipper. It was very thoughtful, Eve, and I appreciate it-
Hmm?
Do you want an argument or an answer?
No.
Why not?
Now you want an argument.
She works hard.
Night an' day.
She's loyal and efficient-
Like an agent with one client.
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
How do you mean that?
You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
Don't be dense. The party.
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
Miss Harrington...
What are you doing here?
I - I guess I fell asleep.
That's all.
What for?
You probably won't believe me.
Probably not.
What report? To whom?
Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
I'll just pick up the broken glass.
How long does it take?
I don't care if I never get home.
You rest. I'll get it...
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
He's the best.
She's got to meet you-
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
Not at all.  Margo, this is Eve Harrington.
Try...
Well...
It couldn't possibly interest you.
Not just that way. As a friend...
I'd like that.
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
Karen.
I think she would cheer.
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
They'll do as they're told.
You won't forget it?
I won't forget.
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
They certainly don't waste much time.
Nothing definite yet - it's just to have lunch.
I don't intend to be.
Can't we sit down? Just for a minute...
Oh, but there is-
Why shouldn't you?  Please sit down.
I'm not crying.
- an understudy's performance.
He can help you.
Something most important you can do.
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
I don't think anything in the world could make me say that.
Thank you, Karen.
How do you do, Mr. Richards.
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
Let's get back to this one. Have you really seen every performance?  Why? I'm curious...
I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
I won't be a minute.
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
The curtains. I made them myself.
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
That's my job.  See you at tea time...
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
I wouldn't like.
I had no idea you knew each other.
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
She's just outside the door.
The heave-ho.
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
Roughly ten minutes.
How far to the station?
Three or four miles...
Not many car either, not much chance of a lift...
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
It doesn't matter.
I detest cheap sentiment.
We've all seemed a little tense lately...
What about Bill?
He's in love with you.
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
Isn't that what they always say?
You'll be there, won't you.
Loud.
In a minute...
Eve?
If we could cast it properly, that is...
Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve.
No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys!
Margo!
I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
Nothing much. She apologized.
Nothing...
Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
... Among so many quiet qualities.
Up in the room.
Shucks. And my autograph book is at the cleaners.
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
When you do, let me in on it.
Twentyish. It isn't important.
Don't be evasive.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
I'm sure.
She was a revelation...
What do you mean?
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
I have no intention of having an accident!
It's not important whether you do. We are wearing long underwear.
You know, she probably means well, after all...
I mean really, deeply angry...
I don't think I could be.
Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
That's right, but I don't understand-
Go ahead, please...
I just played it.
Play it again.
I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
Poor Max. Heartburn?  It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
A couple of weeks.
Anything to help you out, Max.
Give Eve Harrington job in you office.
I promise.
That's my Max.
Are you breaking the contract?
Answer my question!
I said I'm a dying man!
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
--no way--
--read 'em both and you'll see--
Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
Yeah?
Fuck you, Carl.
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
Let me lay a little theory on you--
Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
Hmm.
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
--a spy, you mean?
About the past year.
The fucking New York Times.
--see?--
--I'm trying--
--fifteen phone calls--
--you do?--with access to records?
I never scared anyone before.
Sure.
'68.
Nixon.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
That happens to people.  OK, go on.
And I'll just shitkick in my usual way.
--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
--shit--
--we gotta top the Times--
--I know, I know--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--has he got an ax?--
Who?
Haldeman.
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
It's nothing personal, though. 
Hmm?
Goddamnit!--
--what time is it?
11:30.
Morning or night?
Night.
Oh.
The telephone calls... we know about that.
I'm so glad.
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
And you will.  But not now.
He is not in the car.  Sorry.
That's right.
Mind if I try?
They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
When did he hire you?
Tell that to Muskie.
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
But you know who did.
Sure--off the record.
On the orders of Haldeman?
--that was awhile ago--
--what about you?--
Give me your checkbook then.
It's right under that pile.
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
I don't know what they'd do to me.
Just let me get a match.
Who were they?
What do you want to know?
No games, Irwin; give.
Irwin? I really feel bad, doing something like this--you know that, don't you?
--they're worse. That's why I quit.
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
I will not talk about the other two.
--this'll only take one second--
I'm not your source on that.
--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
My non-denial denial.
I don't know titles.
--what do you think?--
Electronic surveillance.
OK.
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
You're a lawyer and you're here--
I have nothing more to say.
Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
Yes, sir.
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?
Who?--be specific. How high up?
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
James McCord.
Will you step forward, sir. 
Where?
Government. Recently retired.
Where in government?
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
Where?
The C.I.A.
Are you sure?
No.
But it's possible.
I really want to know.
--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
Two o'clock, work the phones 'til you go.
Lotsa hints--
--well, Sloan--
Howard--
--remember Toronto, Harry.
That was awhile ago.
--political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--
--can we use their names?--
Larry Young, a California lawyer--
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
A girl. Melissa.
You work there, Miss Abbott.
I'm not Miss Abbott.
Sorry.
No, it was good.
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
Thanks coach.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
-- Thanks, coach --
Sure.
Suck me...beautiful?
When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
Pardon me?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Single malt?
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
Yes ma'am, I am.
Yep.
Uh-huh.
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
What are we gonna hear?
You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
No idea.
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Just go!
Why is this?
You're gonna shit your pants!
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
You can call me Oz.
Do I have to?
You can call me Ostreicher.
What's your middle name?
Forget it.
Come on!  I won't tell.
Neither will I.
I'm glad you think so.
You don't like it?
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
Because I want to.
Stifler told me.
You talked to Stifler?
...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.
So you're going to Michigan?
What?
You want onions?
Sure.
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding.  So I guess...I'll see you later.
I'm not playing.
You're missing the game for us?!
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
You called me Oz.
What?  We both have cars.
You got it, stud.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
No you haven't.
But that one time --
No.
Of course.
Do you love her?
Did you guys hook up or something?
Are you kidding?  No.
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
I do, baby, I do.
Uh...
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
You think she was serious?
Finch, you got the Latin homework?
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
But --
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
Right.  That gives us...
Exactly three weeks to the day.
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
Went home to shit.
Just in time.
He's going in!
Holy shit!
She's already on a plane back home.
You fuckin' rule!
Oz, how about you and Heather?  Now you guys are a couple or something?
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
Nothing!
Yeah, sure.
You're not...busy?
Dad, come in.
Do you know about the clitoris?
Yes dad.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Okay, well that about covers it.
I know.  Hey Nadia.
Michelle.
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Okay.  You want a story?  Here's a story.  Stifler finds this beer, right?  And...
I told you.
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
So do I, Kev.
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
After high school.
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
Did you see that Central chick? Brunette?
I thought so.
Okay.
Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
Shame on you!
Uh...yeah...sorry.
Yes, slowly.
For me?
Move with the music.
Oh no.
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They arouse me very much.  But not as arousing as you.
God dammit, Stifler!
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
You got in.
Okay, don't stop.
Not for you.
Yes!  I'm a shithead!  I'm a complete and total shithead!
Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
Just a second!
You want to do it?
Yes --
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
It's like a six or seven hour drive. That's easy, I don't mind driving.
Kevin...  I want to have sex with you.
Yeah, are you?
Yeah.
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Me too.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
Yeah, right here.
Yeah.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Does it tell me how to get laid?
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Ready for what?
You've just inherited The Bible.
Oh shit dude, the L-word!
Once, in church, dude.
It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic.  This was before the cheesy remake.
I'm such a loser.
That's the spirit.
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
I don't care.
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
I think we're falling in love.
Fuck yeah we will.
Stifler!!
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Shut the fuck up.
Keep it down, dude.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Dude, watch me work.  They go for sensitive studs like me.
Stifler, fuck --  ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive.
I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
No shit.
Thanks.
Uh huh.
Uhh! Would you die already!
The key is don't look down.
Also like sex with my wife.
Would you shut up?
It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
No it isn't! You're dead!
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?
What?
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.
Serafine...?
It's okay. I can see fine.
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Are you okay?
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
What?! He told you? When?
A cure?
Guess that's why he hid it there. Let's go.
Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
Where?
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
What?
It's making me hungry.
Well, they are French.
Right.
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
You too.
Andy...
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
No... I...
Shit!
Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
Before the coma!
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
You'll never get the chance.
Sure. Don't you?
Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
Why isn't it doing anything!?
What?!
Oh shit... No...
This is... it's like a sick joke, I -
I leave these open. Maybe something comes back to you.
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
Yeah?
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
I told him it wasn't ready...
Andy? Andy is that you?
Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
Yes sir.
He says -
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
I was showing Sonya something . . .
What were you showing her?
How to read.
I know, but I had to because . . .
It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
Get on! Anastasia, get on!
No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
Good day!
Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
I'm fine.
You must have.
You'll laugh.
I shant!
Not you. Him.
Poor Meetoo!
Yes, your highness.
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
I have my reasons.
I was all out of dynamite!
Trying... to... breathe...
Now just get off the train.
No!
You shouldn't have pushed us!
Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
The dessert fork!
It's not you - it's the dress!
Sad?
It's okay. Didn't hurt..
Don't be
I'm glad you	did too.
Anya... where are we?
I'll never let go!
THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
And what do you want, my little rat-with-wings?
Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive.
How do you know?
Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
Bartok... a question.
What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
He's her?
Look!
Ew. . .  the honest type.
Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
Pray he's color-blind...
Ah! Let us begin!
If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
It worked in Odessa...
Are you feeling all right?
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
Run, Anya -  go...
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
Remove him at once.
I should go
She does.
And tell me that she's happy.
Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could.
I had nothing to do with it!
You gave the orders!
I did no such thing!
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
Come on.
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
I need a large polo mallet!
You don't want my autograph.
It's for my brudder.  Alvy Singer! Hey! This is Alvy-
What?
This is Alvy Singer!
This guy, on the Johnny Carson show.
Alvy Singer over here!
Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
What do you mean, next?
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
Yeah? Allison what?
Portchnik.
Yeah, Earl Warren?
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
Two hours? No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in.
Well, stop listening to him.
How can you possibly oversleep?
The alarm clock.
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?
You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.
What-what-what-what's the matter?
I-you know, I don't wanna.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
Oooh! Here! Here!

Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.

Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
No, I'm gonna quit!
Really, do you think so, really?
Yeah?
It's terrific.
What?
Gimme a kiss.
And we'll digest our food better.
Okay?
Yeah.
Okay. Yeah.
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
H'm?
Yeah.
No.  You're a wreck.
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
No.
H'm?
big subject with me, yeah.
Yeah?
Those are the two categories...
And blind people, crippled...
M'hm.
You are extremely sexy.
No, I'm not.
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
Do I love you?
Yeah.
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
Don't you think I do?
I dunno.
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
I have a tiny apartment.
Yeah, I know it's small.
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? 
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
U-huh.
Let's just do it, all right?
Well, I need grass and so do you.
Yeah.
I didn't follow you!
You followed me!
Following is different. I was spying.
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
It's his name.
Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
G-go on, I'm interested.
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
Yeah?
Whatta you mean? Me?
Will it change my life?
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
I'm following you and David, if you-
I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
Oh.
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.
Yeah, where is the spider?
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Is he in the bathroom?
Very big spider.
Yeah?
snow shovel or anything or something.
I think I left it there, I'm sorry.
It's for my complexion.
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
What?
Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
Oh, darn it.
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it.
What... huh?
What thing?
yes, we had, uh...
Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
Nothing at all?
Yeah.
I'm cool.
There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
Remember that day?
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
I thought just earplugs.
This is my room.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Can I confess something?
Step up here!
What'd I do?
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
Don't get upset!
Dammit! I was so close.
What-
My head is throbbing.
I have a headache.
Bad?
Oswald and ghosts.
Jesus!
You catch Dylan?
Tsch, a few.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
Are you?
Yeah.
I mean that as a compliment.
without getting... well, let's put it this way...
What are you depressed about?
It's a narrow view.
Tell him.
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
Hey.
Oh, when'd you quit smoking?
Whatta you mean?
Mean?
Stop calling me Max.
Ah.
Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...
You'll total the whole car.
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
Yeah, I know; but you're adding fake laughs.
Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.
Oh, Jesus.
You all right?
I don't know, I mean, I-
You wanna lie down?
Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
M'hm.
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
And... uh-
We're gonna operate together.
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
Keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don't get old.
His wife has diabetes!
Di-diabetes? Is that any excuse? Diabetes?
She was stealing.
But she's colored.
She was going through my pocketbook!
They're persecuted enough!
Who's persecuting? She stole!
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
Yes, I do.
You think so? Do you really?
We're going to take them to the airport.
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
Well, hi!
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
It was a wonderful set.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
And here, you just-
I was a great beauty.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
I was very charming.
There were many men interested in you?
Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
Did you know the contractor?
Very well.
Was it a contractor?
To code?
You should talk to Mr. Joe.
A triumph.  When did you get here?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
Why didn't you come in?
Would it make a difference?
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
Had a little help?
Absolutely not.
It has your ring.
I'm not that good.
She's got great tits.
She's a constant surprise.
And you've only just met.
The movie.
Any thoughts on casting yet?
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
It's alright, isn't it?
Things always look much worse in the morning.
I don't know how to make her funny.
I...wait, what are you talking about?
What?
Why didn't you bring him?
He's allergic.
Oh.
To dander.  Otis.
Oh.
Didn't I say?
Well, probably.
I'll change back before we leave.
Just don't fucking tell her.
It's not going to come up.
Don't you miss it?
Never.
Really.
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph.
Oh my God, the sitter.
I love her too, Joe.
Yeah.
He's not going tonight.
Count on it.
Fuck you.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
Can I open it?
Sally?
Please?
When does he graduate high school?
Oh, very jealous.
You really need to be fucked.
I love you, Joe Therrian.
Let's go upstairs, okay?
Harry called.
And?
Lucy overdosed.
She's in ICU.
She left a note.
Fuck you.
Leave us alone right now.
Monica.
We live next door.
Oh.  You're them.
Excuse me?
You have?
You have to sign your taxes anyway.
Nice to meet you.
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
Well it's fucking time.
Forget it, Judy.
Are you my big hard hero?
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
Oh yeah?
Let me heal you, baby.
Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus.
A perfect night.
Hm.  We should do it again.
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
Not as a rule.
They didn't sign their goddamn tax returns!
Hey!  Would you?
It was fifteen seconds.
I don't think so.
Are you always this much fun?
Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.
Give him a minute, Clair.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
Anytime, sport.
Yeah, thanks pal.
Fantastic.  Out here.
You only made half your quote this year.
Well, you're a tower of support.
Whatever you say.  Listen, I love you.
He's directing now.
They're paying him scale.
We'll be fine.
Did you invite them?
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
Did you tell Joe to behave?
Did he promise?
Scout's honor.
Just do what I say, alright?
I'm ready.
Ryan's novel?
Happy anniversary.
Accept a compliment.
No.  I missed that.
I mean, you're really back.
For good.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
I'll say as little as possible.
You can never be too early or too thin.
Who'd like to go and find Otis?
It's alright.  Be our guests.
Truce?
Truce.
Dinner.  Don't be angry.
I'm not fucking angry, for God's sake.
It's ecstasy, Sal.
Well he can't have gone far.
There are fucking coyotes out there.
Or shitty!!  Otis!!
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
Hello?  Last birthday was?
Sally, for Christ's sake.
Anyone else?
This is insanity.  Sally...
Don't.
Don't push me away.
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
Don't do this.
I wanted you back.
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
You're not ready.
I'll never forgive you.
I know.
I don't want to go tonight.
You don't have to.
That's under lock and key.
Me too.
It's a Calder.
I know.
He's my favorite.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
Will you make love with me?
Oh, you know, I am.
Has she called?
Come on, Panes...
Sure.
I'll do it.
Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
Lovely.
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
Oh.  Well.  Good.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
Yes.
Don't be silly.
Joking.
It's Jerry's worst idea.
Ah there's our snookums now.
God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
I meant Sally.
I meant Sally.
Oh.  You're serious.
Sally did all this herself?
I'm a little nervous, so...
Oh.
No you're not.
And Ryan works at home.
I'll be your best friend.
I will treasure this.
Sally!!!!
Lemon.
Lemon it is.
I think he's really angry with me too.
That's a lot of those.
Medallions.
A lot of cakes.
Yes.
And he doesn't smoke?
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
You must have been a baby.
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
Come here.
I like you.
I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know.
I'm so sorry.
This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are.
Clair is a hovering mother.
Trust him.
Well...wow...
Not good.
I'm sure you understand.
He always has two or three going...
I'm not going to leave you alone.
They're nothing like us.
Don't go in, Ryan.
What?
Let's just go home, okay?
Sally?
Yes.  And you've met Joe.
Oh?
Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
Well, whoever did this is amazing.
I did it.
I'm so sorry.
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
How long ago was it?
Yes.
Do you need anything else?
No, no thanks.
Oh?
The charades.
Thank you.
That was my clue.
Oh?
The Shostakovich.
Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
Would you, like, marry him?
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Are you asking me to marry you?
Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.
It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
Will champagne help?
Not enough.
Oh great.
Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with me.
She's all over him, are you blind?
It could be worse.
How?
You see, that's worse.
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
I wasn't finished.
Okay.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
We're just feeling our way back.
"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
You know it's true.
What does that mean?
About five thousand dollars.  With my discount.
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
I'm worried about your Galiano.
You're a shit.
No, really, five thousand with your discount.
That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
I don't want to talk about it.
No.  Not something new.
That's not an answer, is it?
Yes, you're a monster.
You don't need to thank me.
We're going to have to go back out there.
It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.
Absolutely.  You always wonder where your books end up.  Why don't we use it?
I'll be right out.
I don't mind...
Relax.  You've done enough.
Evie has a little something for you.
Ah.
Hmm.  Where are my kids?
Nevermind.
Yes.
Hm.
I thought it was okay where it was.
A notch above the storage room.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
Oh Soph...
Well good.  Thank God.
I don't have a drug problem.
Neither does Joe.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Tell me about it.
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
No -- an <u>individual</u>!
Right...because every ant's important!
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
You -- you think I'm right?
Wait!  When can I see you again?
Let me think.  Hmmnn...  Never.  Bye!
I'm Princess Bala.
Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
Divinely?
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
How should <u>I know</u>?
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
Well I guess that makes us even.
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
I <u>didn't</u> choose him.  What kind  of <u>idiot</u> would...  ...<u>choose</u> who she wanted to marry?
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
That's not a name!  That's just a letter!
Wait, I hear something!
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Stop fooling around in there.
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
Well...no, but --
So what makes you so special?
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
There's something going on, Z --
There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where I want to go!
Of course --
And do Princesses do improper things?
Of course not --
Mom!
Trial membership?  Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch.
Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!
Don't get all sappy about it!
Barbatus?
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
No one should have to.  Have him brought to me.
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Good.  You're a good soldier.
Thank you, sir.
I...I have no idea, sir.
Okay, son.
Not that one.  Or that one.
No, sir!
Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
Oh, of course --
Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
They should be...  But there's something funny about that soldier.
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
I'm glad you asked me that question!
I'll be back.
Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
Well, you just sit here and be a party-pooper.
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
You're a real buddy.
Yeah, I know.
What do I do?
You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
That's sweet.  That's real sweet.
Yeah.  How much?
Don't worry about the old lady. One squawk from her, and she's out of a job.
Under the mat? 
That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
Something the matter?
Care to make a small wager?
Shall we say -- a dollar?
It's a bet.
Morning, Miss Kubelik.
Yeah.  I better not get too close.
Oh, I never catch colds.
I should have stayed in bed last night.
Good night.
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
Would you like to?
Sure.
Yeah.
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
No. Like a man.
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
What gave you that idea?
I forgive you.
You shouldn't.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
You're so right.
I thought so.
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
The mirror -- it's broken.
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
I just want to go brush my teeth --
Oh -- of course. I think there's a new toothbrush somewhere.
No -- I don't want anything.
I'll fix you some coffee.
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
Someone from the office.
And where are you now?
In his apartment.
His apartment?
I mean -- her apartment.
What's your friend's name?
Baxter.
Miss. 
As soon as I can walk.
No -- it's my stomach.
Your stomach?
They had to pump it out.
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
You don't have to entertain me.
Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
I don't want it.
Pick a card.
Was he really upset when you told him?
You really think so?
No doubt about it.
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
Miss Kubelik, I don't think that's such a good idea.
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Do I have to?
Gin.
I just want some fresh air.
I would.
Yeah. Well -- that's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise. Go to sleep.
For me?
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
In this house, you're supposed to.
Well, things are a little disorganized around here.
I guess so.
I know so. He's a taker.
A what?
Here.
In the knee?
Of course not. Here's the fruit cake.  And you want to see my knee? 
No -- just come as you are.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.
Might as well go all the way.
I mean, after that?
What?
Fine. How's your eye?
Fine.
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
Good night, Miss Kubelik.
I'm fine.
Are you sure? How's your knee?
I'm fine all over.
Mind if I come in?
Of course not.
Seven --  -- queen.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
Think.
That's right, Baxter.
Yes, sir.
How would you like to go tonight?
Relax, Baxter.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, you don't have to worry --
Not that I have anything to hide.
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
Don't thank me -- thank your friends here -- they're the ones who recommended you.
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
So it was.  She threw it at me.
Put me down for Thursday again.
Roger. And I'll get that other key.
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
Mine?
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
What do you mean, sorry?
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
How's that again?
No key!
So what's it going to be?
Thank you, sir.
Yes?
Look, Buddy-boy -- if there wasn't a lady present, I'd clobber you.
What does he mean, accident?
Who else?
Well -- it's all right with me, Bud. Let me check. I'll get back to you.
What do you want?
What do I -- ?  Just a minute.
Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?
How many pills were in that bottle?
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
Sure.
Kubelik -- with two k's.
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
Not you -- Miss Kubelik.
Well, I have things to do --
What's this -- you packing?
You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?
Family?
No.
Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
You got a girl-friend?
Good night.
Good night?
The party's over.
It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
My shoes.
Kubelik.
Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy done for us lately?
Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a Yellow Cab?
Yeah, he's punchy. Talking to himself.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Dreyfuss.
Get more coffee.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
And what happened to you?
I took sleeping pills.
Do you know where you are, Fran?
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
I don't know.
This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
Come on, Fran.
Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Let me take that.
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
Six weeks. But who's counting?
I missed you, Fran.
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
We talked about a lot of things.
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
I wasn't trying.
What do you think?
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
Are you sure that's what you want?
Fran --
I love you -- remember?
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
You'll miss your train, Jeff.
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
It won't always be like this.  I love you, Fran.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
What's the difference?  Some schnook that works in the office.
Where does she live?
A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Certainly not.  I'm a happily married man.
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
Lovely. You were a big help.
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
It won't happen again.
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
Oh -- oh!
Where are you headed?
Look -- you know the girls -- Thta's Terri -- she was playmate of --
Yeah, I caught your show at Hau Fat.
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
I said I like all of them.
What !
We have a lot of pride in our unit --
One for all -- all for one --
You can keep your fucking fuel --
Men of all races -- nationalities --
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
Moonby what?
Sure, thanks.
Part.
Which part is that ?
My part.  Beer, with ice and water.
No.
Yeah. Way north.
What unit were you with ?
Rangers, eh?
Sort of.
No -- I worked too far north for LRRP.
Yeah.
Fat. That's real fat.
Sometimes.
How long were you up there ?
A long time.
Yes, sir --
Why they call you that?
Call me what, sir?
Cook school -- that did it.
How?
I don't know.
Whatdoya think it thinks.
That we're dumber than we look.
Yeah, it is.
Looks that way.
Who's he?
God knows.
Not a thing.
Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
Where ?
First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River.
The draft of that river might be too shallow on the point.
I'll go with him --
All right I got a little surprise for you --
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
No shit -- hot damn --
Get in there now or I'll bury you in this river.
In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light.
We're Americans.
When'd you do it?
While you were sleeping.
Thta's not Charlie's work --
Yeah -- like keep out --
What is it?
Listen.
Who knows? Right.
Looks pretty shallow.
Too far inland.
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
I saw that Colonel's Huey on the point --
I wonder if that was the same copter.
Would he remember you ?
Anyone got a cigarette.
Ours.
Touchy.
Terminate with extreme prejudice.
Yeah, it still runs.
Do me a favor buddy, please.
What is it?
Charlie?
Charlie?
They must have seen the fire.
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
Yeah.
This gentleman or myself ?
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
A lame ?
Maybe.
Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
Do you know that jungle?
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
That's right, sir.
I haven't surfed since I got here.
What, sir?
Sure -- fine --
Yeah -- yeah, I can understand how you feel.
What do you mean?
Six to eight feet.
Wh -- what?
You want'a surf, soldier?
Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
No. Walked.
What'd you do for supplies?
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
Can you trust them?
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
Don't you agree?
What about this point here?
The enemy. Who else?
The kid can't ride sloppy waves.
I'm Kurtz.
You were not coming here, to see me?
Yes.
Yeah, I like it...
I love it.
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
How's yours?
I can handle it.
No water.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
What are you doing?
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
I had immense plans.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I was on threshold of great things.
I'm taking you back.
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
Were you with him, when...
What?
Which one's the Colonel's?
Yeah, Jesus Christ !
Any time -- us -- Americans.
I wasn't looking.. I was running.
No -- leave it --
That's me.
We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
Simple. They don't want him to go.
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
And shut up.
His name is...
Cognac?
The war will still be here tomorrow.
Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
What did you hear?
But Captain, I mean -- cannibals.
The river is beautiful.
Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
Well who the hell verifies that ?
No sir, I think -- this'll be a little bit different --
Anyone got a card?
Son of a bitch, sir.
Beverly Hills --
What?
Needs patching.
Wait 'til I'm across!
43   CONTINUED:
94   CONTINUED:  
Your infrared camera?
Keep back.
28   CONTINUED:
Back against the bars.  Now.
She's dead.
Oh.
I don't want to talk any more.
The radio's on the fritz.
Where'd you say Eric is?
Somewhere along the pipeline.
Be careful -- there're two of them.
Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
That's not what I meant.
It's exactly what you meant.
Not me.  I'm equipped.
Wait a second.
That's my line.
I'll tell you everything later.
Where's Corbett?
Relax.  I just want to ask them how the hunting is.
I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
Leave my traps.  We'll tag up, couple days.
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?
New to the country, kid?
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
A daughter in Oregon.
That's right.  You're not.
Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.
I'm right behind you.
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
I'm still figuring: You're either real brave or real dumb.
You know Meyerling?
I'm here to do my job.
Too bad we're heading west.
You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
How many do you see?
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
You don't feel cold?
It's a spring day...
Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
Hate to disappoint you.
You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.
I already have.
You don't know how true that is.
You broke the radio, remember?
I'm sure she's fine.  Seemed like a clever kid.

We'll get you to a hospital, soon as we get to Fairbanks.
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
No, I better stay at my post.
But I would.
Don't try me.  I'll kill you if it comes to it.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
What does this matter to you?
-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.
Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
Any idea who could've done it?
I could've sat tight for the transport, 'til Bob came poking around.
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
What you gonna do with it?  Large bore's for shit on small game.
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
Ease off.  We do this my way.
Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --
You met the gift.
I want us to go out.
I love you.
Don't be silly. How bad?
Not bad.
No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
Stay out of this...  Doctor?
Uh-huh.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
Will you please take it?
I've got Jews at my table.
What do you care?
Spencer.
Okay.
Spence.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!
How ya doing?
Carol the waitress?
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
Why did yo do this for me?
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Just how grateful I am.
What you did changed my life.
Thank you.
Two days.
I can't. I work.
You take off when you have to.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
What's that got to do with it?
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
Is there another way to see it?
Are you still coming?
Yes.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.
Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
Can we order first?
One baked -- one fries.
Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
Here's the trouble with never.
It was a mistake.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
This one has a special meaning.
I'll take you... why not?
Yeah... Well...
How you doing?
I can trust my brain.
That seems like a good choice.
Go ahead.
I should've danced with you.
Okay. Good-bye.
So long.
What do you want?
Were you asleep?
What are you doing here?
What a break...
I had to see you...
Because...
You know what? I...
Well...
I'm sorry... are you okay?
How to die, mostly.
Good night.
Stop staring. Do a vase.
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
I'll take care of myself --
You think you're kidding.
Don't want to. I love you.
No. No. Get Carol.
What the heck do you mean?
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
Two years ago...
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
So am I, Frank.
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
Hey -- you called me... I...
About a dog.
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
Hi. You have hard shells, right?
Wait here.
No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
You little stinker. He's given you everything.
Oh, is he dead?
Ask him.
How're you doing?
Maybe this can wait.
Well, that's a load off.
Do you realize that I work at him?
Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Thank you for walking him.
It smells like shit in here?
Go away.
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Please, just leave.
Where are all your queer party friends?
Rot in hell, Melvin.
Oh, my gosh.
Now we'll both call him.
Yo, yo, yo...
Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
Never a break. Never.
I give you that one...  Nice packing.
Does it matter?
What are you talking about?
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
But you know where you're lucky?
Absolutely not.
I forgot to lock the door.
I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
Just a second -- he has to go.
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Where?
What?
What restaurant?
Uh, Fontella's
So you're from around here?
Not too good at small talk, eh?
I know just what you mean.  I'm pretty beat myself.
What?
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
What?  You think I'm running you up?
Just do your job.
No fucking way.
Okay, don't.
Holy shit!  Robert Rath wants to know my name.
How long have you been freelance?
Two years.  Two long fucking years.
We go around once.
Bullshit.
What?  What's okay?
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
All right, Bain.  Pay attention, because this is where everything changes.
That's right.
Bain!
You're too late.
I don't give a fuck what you are.  I asked you --
Do you want Rath or not?
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
Sick.  The flu.
I don't believe you.
I'm worried about you, Robert.
The contract was stolen.
Know what?
I know.  It was a joke.
The contract?
Paid in full.
I bet you fucking know!
It cost us.
Robert?  Robert?
One hour per man.
Where are we going?
What?  How did you know I had a cat?
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
Yeah?
Yeah.
The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.
Now you understand why I'm here.
Turn off the engine.
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
An assassin?
Until a minute ago.
What does that mean?
Another contractor.
Someone hired both of you?
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
He wants to kill you?
Yes.
Why?
And you want to use me to get him?
Forget it!
We don't have a choice.
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
Rath.  Robert Rath.
Electra.
Just Electra?
Yeah.
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
No.  Just Electra.
Why?
Because I'm done.
It's not the same, is it?
Better than playing with yourself.
Why?
More or less.
How old were you?
You were like a boy genius?
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
I was just different.
You went from high school to the Agency?
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
Why not?
Because you are a women.
My first take?
Yes.
Why?
Because I want to know.
No.  Just the first one.
After that?
They become complicated... messy.
Did it ever bother you?
Did it ever bother James Bond?
That's fiction.
I don't.
Several.
Good.
Where is it?
Mexico.
Thinking.
About?
Nothing.
You were there?
What?
Why not?
Work.  The things I need to get done.
What happens if you do?
You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
Here?
In Costa Blanca.
Yes.
I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
Really?
Sorry.
How was the beach?
The beach?  It was nice.
Taiwan.
Transmits and receives.
It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
Then, we wait.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
What?
I told you, he will.
Yes.
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
What happened?
Yes.  Here I am again.
No.
Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
They're worth less points.
I didn't notice them.
How do you know they're not?
I went into their room this afternoon.
Nobody ever sees me.
No?
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
What?
That's a ridiculous move.
Why?
Because, I'll take it.
I'm sure you will.
Am I attractive?
Are you attracted to me?
Yes.
Why?
Why?  I don't know.
Attraction is a complication?
It can be.
It happened to you before?
Who was she?
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
She was taken.
Did you --
Was she the only one?
I'm not sure that I care anymore.
When did it start?
Honestly?
Uh-huh.
That doesn't sound normal.
I'm not normal.
Martin.
What?
I waited another four minutes.
Shit.
I'm taking off my mike.
Okay.
Electra --
What?
Last night --
Yes.
Oh, God.  I see it!
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
Yes.  Please come in.
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
I called because I just want... I need to talk.
Honesty.
Everyone regrets something.
All the time.
Can you tell me about it?
Do you believe that?
Yes.
Anytime.
It's possible.
You're pretty famous aren't you?
I hope not.
Shit... oh well.
That's exactly what I told myself.
Go ahead.
What do other guys do?
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
Why didn't you fade?
You mean quit?
Yeah.
How would you like the funds?
American currency.
This will take some time.
I have all day.
Thank you.
And pay for their drinks occasionally.
A coke, if they have it?
Hey Doug, you want a beer?
What's that? A Democrat with an attitude!
Wanker more like, what does he know about writing.
We're only joking.....It is your round though!
Well, this place is too expensive so you've had it.
Never heard of K-MART?
What did the beer cost?
Fifteen crowns.
An alternative literary venue!
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
So? DOUG Well, there's tons of empty buildings - why don't we get one?
You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
That makes you an expert I guess.
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
Tell them we're working for the University.
Thought of everything haven't you.
Yep, except a name for this place.
You're nuts man, Katka's right!
'cause you stink of booze.
No....The Asylum!
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
I've been saying that since we met.
No, it's welded up!....Let's take a look from the inside.
But how did the wall get here?
Don't we have enough already?
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
Yeah, I'll take some.
Have you ever stolen anything?
Nope.
No, for the Asylum.
Close!
They'll never get us.
We're going to need it all.
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.
We don't speak Czech!
Am I late?
Who put a bee up your butt?
When your ready Son!
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
Both, see you later.
No, not yet.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
No, We aren't going to do it.
I fell in love.
And a tram hit you?
No, the boyfriend.
What happened to Katka?
You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?
A fine specimen for conversion.
What are you on about?
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
Nothing, it's just that's when things usually start to go wrong.
You capitalist pig!
Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
I don't want to ruin your day.
So I hear.
Huh?
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
I could try and get a Western lawyer.
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
Siberia.
Good, what's his number?
Some deal you did there!
What are you talking about?
You're sure?
Sure I'm sure!
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
Yeah, pretty well.
Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
That one?
Yeah!
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
Follow that Budjovice sign.
Yeah....Shit, those guys have guns.
Doug?
Turn around quick!
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative.
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
I've been around.
Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
Here's the details.
Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
We should be done by the weekend.
I'll take a rain-check for now.
Yeah, maybe.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
I think he's jealous of Havel.
I don't care. I'm not staying out late Doug.
Look, just hear me out, okay?
Don't worry it's okay!
We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
So, we won't be going to London?
No, not just yet.
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
Let's have a look anyway.
Yeah, you're right.... I've got an idea!
Fernet and tonic.
Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
I hope so!
There's nothing there for me.
Not this time, Kat.
Sure, I've done it easily.
Hey Chris, keep an eye on things.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
It's not so much.
Okay.
About forty minutes.
Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.
Yo, dobree!
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
Good, great....Dobchay!
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
Two hundred dollars, make it six thousand crowns?
Insurance!
No, it should be over soon.
You mean it's started?
We don't need you.
A champion of lost causes huh?
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
We_re not all running away
I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
Yeah seems okay.
No, just a coffee.
One beer, one coffee, thanks.
I'll be okay, just get me home.
I had it coming from someone.
Are you sure I shouldn't get a doctor.
Sometimes.
Run into Josh?
Yeah, but it was okay.
Hmm, I still owe him.
Why don't we both forget about him?
It's Josh's.
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
And you broke into that room?
That's right.
You will wish you hadn't.
Fuck you!
It was the biggest I could find.
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
A kind of freedom.
No!
You may use my office.
Release Mr Greenwell's possessions.
Working....Under cover.
A drill, what are you up to?
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
Come on, that shit can wait.
See you brought one of the patients with you too.
Well come on, sit down.
It's time to go home, Holly.
Go to hell!
It's more than what you're worth.
You bastard!
Don't you dare, I'll be back!
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
Can we talk in your office?
Yes, if you can get him free.
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
We're not sure...
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
Some Americans?
What if his accomplices have made copies?
With you.
I. Don't. Dance.
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
I'll tell her you were here.
I'm sorry about how we --
I do.
Kelly wouldn't do that.
Why not?
Cuz nothing happened at school.
About a job.
I don't want his money.
It could help with a new car --
That's over. Way over.
You're fine like that, Mom.
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
No. I won't be long.
Late night.  You?
Were you with Jamie?
Yeah.
You sleeping with her?
You do. You're handsome and charming.
I meant he's a doctor.
Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
I didn't know either.
Now it's okay?
I need to whizz.
I'm just wondering --
You do --
Demented.
Scamming's a strong word.
Later.
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
Me.
-- This your idea of small talk?
I don't make small talk --
-- Obviously.
You don't know me.
Can't you have a normal conversation?
I don't want to have any conversation.
'They won't.'
'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
-- This play means a lot to me.
Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.
Why?
No. Not like you.
So you agree you need help?
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
Go for it.
You want to tell me...
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
Know so.
Could be...
That is my telescope.
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Or building blocks for a world that never formed.
I hope so.  I think maybe she sees me now.
In ten words or less?
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
You don't believe in anything?
Your father doesn't like me.
Sometimes I don't even trust me.
I'm really glad you think so.
Yeah --
Belinda's a very jealous person.
That would be the reason.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
Then maybe you can read mine.
Healthy as can be.
Thank you. So were you.
You're hardly nice to anyone.
And that would ruin your reputation how?
That sounds like horseshit.
It's not.
Prove it.
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
I don't want to be just your friend --
You don't know what you want --
When I have something to say.
It means you can do anything.
No.  But are you -- impressed?
What?
I'm not allowed to date.
I wanted this to be a date.
I have to get you home by one.
No.
I know you want to.
We're doing something -- ?
Where?
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
What do you actually know with religion?
Wonder. Beauty. Joy.  Love.
Maybe you're not supposed to.
Not possible.
Loved?
That. And less strange.
Twice a year.
Where?
Away from here.
Look. Talk. Not talk.
The truth. I just left you out of it.
I was twelve.
Mars doesn't rise until 2:30
Hoped for it.
No. Why? Are you seducible?
Sure.
I don't care.
Yes. I try to keep my power.
Yes, one of many.
I'm not applying to college.
What are you going to -- ?
Pull over.
Where? Why?
I'm sick.
I should have told you sooner --
I will.
Anything you want.
Nothing.
I used to like yogurt.
That I want you to take me home.
That's what I mean.
I was going to fake it.
Tired.
Better. I was really angry.
You'll be fine for a few minutes.
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
But if you could, you would?
He wants help with his lines --
I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
Up to?
Boys like him have -- expectations.
I have expectations, too.
This -- him -- Landon -- is what's best for me!
Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
By making me ill, he is punishing me!  I just don't know what for.
Lead man.
I don't want to see her hurt.
Ever again.
Like what, sir?
You decide.
Your parents are divorced?
How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
Either. Both.
If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!
I'm not tired.
I need to be with her.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
For the focuser?
I helped Jamie with the first one.
I thought she built it herself.
Yes. You?
Getting by.
Yes.
She did. It was you.
That's right. You just act like one.
That's right.  The world is your oyster.
I want to come back.
How would you do that, Mr. Carter?
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
You don't. That's the point.
-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
I didn't say you did.
You came here to give me my report card?
You're welcome.
A similar triangle?
Okay. Make me an isosceles.
What do you want, Biff?
Where's your old man?
Yes, sir!
Uh, yes, sir...
Marty. What's for breakfast?
Gimme some chili, fries, and a Tab.
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
Third time they've been out there this week.
I don't know. National Cash Register?
Fine.
Learn anything?
Oh yeah.
That's good.
Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
Seventeen.
Uh, thanks...
Uh, hi....
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
But he didn't ask me.
But he does! Don't you see?
Coming, Eileen...
How are you?
What drill?
Learn anything?
Oh yeah.
Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
Okay, then!
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
Bic... It's a Bic pen.
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
Look, Marty, I'm just not a fighter...
And where am I gonna be?
In the parking lot, with her.
Why what?
No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
Not a holocaust --
Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
Marty. Marty Lewis.
Five cents, please.
Operator, what's today's date?
March 11th.
What year?
Nineteen fifty --
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
AM or PM?
Pro, the sun's out!
Oh, right, right... 
...To be traveled through
Is Shemp all right?
So what? We'd be rich!
You know me?
You were ringing the doorbell!
Professor, be serious, would you?
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
Well, it was there.
Curious... Very curious....
You did what?!?
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
Perfect...
A car.
The Orpheum.
What? 
A Tab.
What happened to Dick Wilson?
Hi, Marty!
What did you do to yours?
Well, he's gone.
Gone?... Where?
He said not to tell.
Oh yeah?
Can't afford to take chances.
You don't mind?
What do you mean?
Not bad.
They come with the house.
She plays the clarinet, too.
No, he showed me one.
Okay.
What do you feed him?
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
He never bit me.
You lost that one?
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
You like people?
They're okay.
Then why'd you do it?
Tom...
Good luck to you.
Thanks.
I mean it.
What'd you come out here for?
I wasn't aware there was any law against it.
Yeah.
What're you doing?
No, you're not either.
Yeah? Why not?
Cause I can't allow it.
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
What's your friend's name?
You love him?
I don't know.
Well, I've felt that way, hadn't you?
Doing what?
Can I be honest?
Sure.
Yeah.
There you go.
Well, stop the world.
Quit my job.
Well, I got homework.
Bring it along.
I know.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Just don't... I've got a headache.
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
I don't care.
Don't ask me.
What?
Well, that's the point, stupid.
How bad off is he?
I can look and see.
You don't believe me, see for yourself.
You said that once already... Too late now.
Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
Yeah, me too.
I got him in the stomach.
I don't know.
Just to keep him out of the sun.
Yeah.
Well, we'll see about that... Hey, lookie.
Well, why you always walking behind me?
Positive?
Yes.
Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.
I'm serious.
It was going too fast.
Yeah.
I just don't want to go.
Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
This your place?
Just thinking.
Yes.
Okay, no monkey business then.
Just a second now. That's your truck. isn't it?
It's mine all right.
Just gimme a chance.
Git.
Hold it right there.
Beats me.
Wanta sue me?
No.
Who're you?
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
Not me. No way.
They're stealing my chopper!
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
Planet 10?
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
Same one you had yesterday?
Vanished. Thin air.
First thing I did.
The deuce you say.  That crate!
Just 'grazed' you, huh?
Arachtoid.
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
Not really.  This is pretty important.
She wants a picture.
I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
Let her out?  She's a killer.
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
What is it, Tommy?
Where's the professor?
Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.
At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!
Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.
Now!
What? How do you know that?
Don't shoot!
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
This is so embarrassing...
Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
Everybody okay up here?
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
You.  Like the papers all say.
Pretty terrible shot.
Who?
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
Which?  The one in my throat.
Any time.
Oh, my.
You don't wanna know.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
Go where?  Where're you going?
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
Absolutely.
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
Penny--?!  Are you all right?
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?
I have a radio fix...
You look!  It's not here!
Damn John Whorfin--!
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.
I didn't drop 'em.
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.
Where do you hail from, Doc?
No!  Ditto the professor-
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
How about you? Will you be alright?
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
...I know this must look... funny.
No, no 
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
What. What don't I understand?
Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink.
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
What are they like? What are they about?
You wrote his scripts for him?
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
Before Bill came to Hollywood.
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
I want to know!
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
Drown all those rascals...
...Who is this?
Chet!
...Who?
Garland, it's me.
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
What DID you mean?
A week, eight, nine days 
I...
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
Nothing, really. Said he was in the insurance business.
What else?
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
Just Bill, please.
It's still a little early for me.
So be it.
...Huh? No, I'm 
I'm a writer. Ted O 
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
He's a great writer 
A souse!
What do you do far a living?
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
Yes... Isn't it?
Well, you just... sound a little
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work 
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
Damned difficult, I'd imagine.
What kind of scribbler are you  newspaperman did you say?
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now 
Hell, I could tell you some stories
Frequently played, seldom remarked.
Well, I can tell you some stories 
Charlie. How are you.
No, I guess you're stuck with the one you've got. Have a seat.
Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
Ready... wrestle!
Hi, Charlie.
Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
Course not, compadre. You'll see me again.
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
Are you sure 
No... no...
No... Can I come in?
Why don't we go to your room-
Charlie, I'm in trouble  something horrible's happened  I've gotta call the police...
Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
I've gotta call the police  or you could call for me 
You gotta believe me 
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
We gotta call the police 
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
What do you think happened?
I believe you  I KNOW you. But why should the police?
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
Charlie! I've got no one else here! You're the only person I know in Los Angeles...
Because you DON'T LISTEN!
Lou.
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
I apologize, Barton.
Mr. Lipnik.
Colonel Lipnik, if you don't mind.
Transient or resident?
Huh?
What 
The others are being sent.
Uh-huh.
Nine days  Tuesday 
You're a sick fuck, Fink.
What do you do, Fink?
Would that be good enough for ya?
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
Also known as Madman Mundt.
All of which he's now missin'.
Well, some of his throat was there.
Physician, heal thyself.
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
No reputable company would hire a guy like that.
Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't it?
I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
Give you nose bleeds?
You two have some sick sex thing?
How's about it, Bart?
Home. Watching TV.
Yeah.
Were you drinking?
When did you start drinking again?
A couple days ago.
Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
Did you find out about her parents?
Bring 1976 up.
Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine.
No.
No?
Thank you.
Yeah.
You don't look so okay.
What else is new?
Catherine Tramell.
Why didn't you tell me?
I thought you quit.
Who's got access to my goddamn file?
No, Nick, please --
Nilsen.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
Tell me about Catherine.
What did she tell me, Beth?
I had him in two classes.
You saw all the reports, Beth!
She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
Put your hands up!
I know who you are.
About a year and a half.
Were you with him last night?
Only when they make interesting reading.
I don't smoke.
Yes, you do.
I quit.
I found some in my purse; would you like one?
It won't last.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman.
I loved him.  I hurt.
No.
Because you didn't love him --
That's right.
Thanks.
You see?  We're both innocent, Nick.
You know all about me.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
No.  Come in.
I'd like to ask you some, too.
I don't know.  But you do.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
They were drug buys.  I was a vice cop.
There's a name from the past.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
Didn't you study it in school?
Do you?
Why not?
You can make a mistake.
Not me.
Ice?
Please.
Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
What if I call you Nicky?
My wife used to call me that.
I know, Nicky, but I like it.
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
It's not the same thing, is it?
What do you want from me, Catherine?
What's it about?
To see if he can get away with it.
Why take the risk?
I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
She's seen everything before.
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
Do you want her to join us sometime?
It hurts.
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
I told you I had a vivid imagination.
I don't have a choice.
I know.
Do you think I told her to kill You?
Make love to me.
I never have before.
No?
Try me.
I don't know.
I'll convince you.
I did, too.  She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.
Liar.
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
No.
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
What are you researching?
I'm writing a book.
Really.  What are you writing about.
What happens to them?
Why not?
Somebody has to die.
How did it end?
I told you.  She kills him.
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
The games are over.  You were right. It was the fuck of the century, Shooter.
What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
Did you ever tie him up?
He was murdered.
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown.
Why would I need an attorney?
Yes I am.
How's that?
Cocaine.
.38 revolver.  Never recovered.
Were there ever any suspects?
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
Was his wife ever a suspect?
Nope, can't say that I do.
That's him.
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
What kind of talk?
The usual -- a girlfriend.
He had a girlfriend?
You did.
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
I never heard of him.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
I'm a smart sonofabitch.  I just hide it.
She misses me.
Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.
You sure got real conclusive ways of demonstrating that.
What is it you got between you?
I don't know.
Somethin', though.
Everybody that she plays with dies.
I know what that's like.
I went over last night, too.
I wasn't there last night, either.
I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber.
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
Say what?
I feel fine!
Why the hell not?
I don't know.  I'm just not.
She's right.  You got an icepick in you yet?
Why not?
You're my friend, Gus.
He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.
I'm going with you.
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
Yeah.  I know.
He looks a little shrunk, that's all.
What do you want?
You're looking for Catherine, not me.
Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
We bring her in for questioning.
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
Fuck you, too Nick.
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
Did you check all four years?
Yes I did.
Can you check again?
Only if you're making it.
I'm a painter, too.
Rene's been telling me about your work.
I don't know.
When's your show?
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
Let's get out of here.
The whole thing  painting.
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
It's in New Jersey.
New York.
I think it's in New Jersey.
It's in New York.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Yeah... Like  stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
Ten bucks apiece.
That's good. At least they're interested.
What's wrong?
Do you still love her?
Well, have you asked her to come back?
I don't like beer.
We can do better. It needed more white.
Annina Nosei.
Who?
No.
Aren't they?
How much for these five?
You should talk to him about this.
I really think you should talk to him about this.
You haven't been by lately.
How about right now?
I know.
Hi Dad. Hi Nora.
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
How do you know?
I know that. Don't let him get away.
What do you mean?
They're just words.
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
I use a lot of colors  not only black.
I'm not black.
You're not?
Not black.
No, I'm Haitian-Puerto Rican.
We don't hang them at home, y'know  just in the streets..
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
Very well.
Out?
Still not here.
 In this corner?
Yeah..
Use your fucking instinct.
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve  I mean Shenge.
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
What's wrong with you today?
SAMO.
About what?
Your people.
Oh  you mean black people!
Hi Gina.
Come on in!
For real?
Yeah... I'll paint on it.
I ain't John Henry.
Good.
What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
Good. What do you have?
Come on, let's get out of here.
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
Guess I just got sick of him.
Can I walk you home?
I think I could do that alone.
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
Party girls? Can I call you?
Yeah, if you have any dimes left. 477- 0496.
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
You don't have any fucking money..
What who's saying?
It's Monday morning.
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
Basquiat, what did you take?
You want some?
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee 
Staten Island would be ok.
Think so?
You mean babies with you?
You're your own baby.
Hi.
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
Pretty much the same.
Forget it.
You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
Yeah, it's the best one.
I'll take the whole tin.
It's three thousand dollars!
Me? Why?
Sure. I'd be glad to.
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job?
Hi.
Some of them.
Stand still.
Thanks
I'd like to squeeze your titties.
Wanna Mac?
No, I'd like the scarf.
Have a Mac.
I don't eat junk food.
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it  did your girlfriend leave you?
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
My point exactly.
So shut up and keep painting..
What time is it?
5:11.
I can't. After the show.
Forget it.
Yeah.
That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
I need this?
I need this?
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
It's vichyssoise, sir.
Vichyssoise.  Supposed to be cold, right?
No, actually I feel worse.
I think I'll take the stairs.
Yes, I suppose that we did.
Right.  Sure.  And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."
I'm -- sorry, I --
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
What're you really after?
Have we?
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
Didn't I say that?
Yes and no ...
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
Well, I could ... free up some time...
I'm tempted.
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
"We"?  You and...
Had one.  Didn't work.
And the truth frightened her?
Photojournalist.
Sure.
Nor I, on the second.
What're you doing three dates from now?
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
Weird, huh?
Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
Yawn.
Either you've caught a cold, or you're planning to kill me.
Was.
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
Huh?  You're implying I'm some kinda psycho criminal?
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Oh, him again.  He's already history -- check it out.
You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
Dad!  Save yourself!
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
PMS.
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
... eight, seven...
Silent night, violent night...
All is shrill, all is blight...
My lips are sealed.
Quiet, Max.  What do you think, this is a conversation?
No, just give you a splitting headache.
Well it's not working.
Oswald:  We need one more thing.
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
And a very, very good one.
Too good?
Eventually she married a young physician.
Oh no, those things frighten me.
As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child.
Too late for what, dear child?
In spirit only, I'm afraid.
The boys need help.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
No apology necessary.  That's the first time in thirty years.
There's a lovely inn just down --
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.
What seems to be the problem?
That, sir, does not compute.
Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
Oxbridge Academy?
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
I'm afraid to ask.
Be ready for anything.
I don't know.  It just feels right.
Freeze, you're mad.  This capsule will slaughter thousands.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
It's the gear.  Chicks love the gear.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
How about, nice to see you?  Glad you're here to save my life.
Surf's up.
He'll be here.
I'll borrow it from you.  Four million - -
I can make it.
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
Definitely.
Just the beast.
She knows who we are.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
Maybe he melted.
From the other side of the equator-
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.
People come first, Dr. Isley.
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
What?
I wish I knew.
Well...um...her.
Presumed dead.  No one knows.
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
You left your back wide open.  Freeze could have killed you.
Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?
But he's never said a word-
I'm scared, Dick.  Maybe for the first time in my life.  I'm really scared.
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
Dick, don't push me right now.
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
She wants to kill you.
Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
Where is my wife?
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
I'm hungry.  I think I'll have poultry.
I find that unlikely.
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
At you?  Polly want a kiss?
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
One kiss, my love.  For luck.
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
I think they're getting worse.
It's a wonder you sleep at all.
Hardly a worry, sir.
She has an excellent mind.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
No. You said I. I killed them.
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
He ran away?
Actually, he took the car.
He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
The _Rolls_?
_No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_!
Which `they' might that be, sir?
Why, indeed?
There's one other thing. I feel..
...Afraid.
What?
...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
What do maniacs always want?
Recognition, of course.
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
How about, MR. E.
Mystery.
And another name for Mystery?
Enigma.
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
How ya doin', Al?
Al?
Big house. How many rooms?
Just checking, young sir.
Four seconds from...
What's wrong?
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!
We'll talk some other -
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
La'chiem.
Slanta.
Banzai.
Just ones this beautiful.
On occasion. Usually at night.
Wacko? That a technical term?
What do you know about obsession?
Not much.
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
Would you? I'm not so sure.
And into a black dress.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
What? This isn't normal?
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep.
Well, I met someone...
Fast work. You just moved here.
What?
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
What do you want me to say? That I'm not attracted to him?
What?
Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
Stop fighting.
You do know. Try.
Chase. There's something I need to tell you--
Excuse me.
Who is it?
How could I forget?
You're right, Edward. I didn't mean to be impolite. Please.
Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?
What the hell is going on here?
What say we flip for it?
The coin _wants_ to decide.
Never heard of a double-cross?
Here. Get a good seat.
Everything.
You're a genius.
Miss.
You sunk my battleship.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
... Very good, sir.
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
Take me. Let the boy go.
I know. I called them.
Shouldn't we --
He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!!
... A hundred and eight?
Well -- I think you might consider
How do I know you won't keep them all?
I'll take you with me.
... Where are you taking me?
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. -- What's that?
Better. It's not on the market yet.
It doesn't protect your head, though.
That's why I wear a target on my chest.
If you don't mind my asking... Who's close to you?
I had to save you, Vicki. I --  -- Please trust me.
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word.
Because I...  ... Because she'd never speak to me again.
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
Good.  With any luck we'll run into each other.
... Terror.
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
I see.  If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
... We could try that.
... Looks like a convention.
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
... Where are you calling from?
Finding out where she is.
What now?
In all these years... Why couldn't I see how it wold turn out?
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
I suggest a nice big bomb.
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
Take 'em! I want his head!
WHAT?
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
WHAT??
It's a detour. They're backed up for blocks!
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
What are you, scared of heights?
I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up --
Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
Because I want someone I can trust.
JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
And what happens if we say no?
That's it.
What?  I improved her a little...
Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
Some.  I am a rich bitch, remember?  I'm quoting.
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
Yum, yum.
His face.  Allie, look at his face.
... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
Not what?
He's not crazy.
Tom Jones?
Your face smells like a foot.
It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.
Hi.....  Roses.
Meaning?
Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?
About Charles...
Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
No, I'm fine.
Annie, it's me.
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
I can understand THAT. Neither do I.
Night.
Excuse me.
Yes.  Ahm... think I'11 ...
What?  What?
What happened?!!!
Ahm.... .
Ah. Fine.  It's good.  It's great.
Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
I beg your pardon?
Er ... pray tell me why?
Exactly.  She's in a surprisingly terrible state.  Isn't she, Bean?
Certainly is.
And a car.
Mmmmm...
A car sounds sensible.
Sean Connery.
There's a man.  I woke up next to a man ...
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
Sure did.
I vote for Bart.
How the hell should I know?
Yes?
Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
It is urgent, sir.
Okay.....
Why thank you sir.

Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
The TV.

Huh huh. This says Beavis.

You mean there's mre than one?

Butt-dumpling...
Turd-burglar...
Dill-wad...
Bunghole...
Butt-snatch...
Uh... dill, um, face...
Um... ass... head...
Uh... butt-snatch...
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...
Yer late.
Just make sure it looks like an accident...
Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
Well, if you find yourself getting tired, take a couple of these.
Heh heh, thanks.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Uh, we didn't score yet.
Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.
Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Thrr...
I see it. I don't get it.
Deep and hard.
Where did these guys come from?
Agent Hurley...
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
Who knows?
She sure does.
Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's Butt. Huh huh huh.
Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
Yoo-hoo! Travis and Bob Head. Whoo-hoo!
Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
Yup. Huh huh.
Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
You'll be rich!
We're rich in what really matters.
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
God, how I have looked forward to this, honey.
It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
I'm not sure.  It feels... frozen.
I am sitting.
What?
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
Look at the publisher.  Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.
This is going to take some time.
What's she doing here?
I don't know.  <u>Jane, Jane, up here</u>!
At least we won't have to worry about her.
They make gypsies look good.
No, I'm not putting up with this.
Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
<u>You</u> left me.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
That's all we need.
I don't know... what are you looking up?
No.  But it's somewhere without big worms.
Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really <u>moan</u>!  Practice, practice, practice.
Where are your skulls and bones?
You know you're really a pretty girl.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
Of course I did.
Then it should be here.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
... Yes this must be him.  Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
Three times.  Powerful number.
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.
Maybe we should knock first?
... acts like she's thirty-five.
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
Who did the sushi?
You can build another one... with her.
Just a hunch.
3:30 I guess.
Give or take a year.
Is this like a trick question?
We were trying to scare your mother.
Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles.
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
Really.  I don't know.
I got an A!
W... We didn't know how to make one.
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
Now, let's get rolling!
No.  What's wrong?
We're...
You're the dead.
What do you expect?  You're dead.
Yes.
What do you mean?  What's he do?
Life is just... too awful.
Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
I think so.
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
Of course you do.
No, dummy.  Two.
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
Good girrrl!
Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
That's it!
Just <u>say</u> it.
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
You've got to help them.
Can you help <u>me</u>?
... I will.

Your qu...?  But you're...
I'm beeyoo-teeful.
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Why not?
I think she's in with them.
Not these people!  They are ruthless!
Delia hates it.
My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
I'm lonely.
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
... sheets.
<u>This is not a joke</u>!  That sheet was full of ghosts.
They're ghosts.  They do what they want.
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
Delia will cook...
Otho, could you actually... do something with them?
I saw some ghosts.
Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
No time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.
Viridian?
Viridian?  What is...?
Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
Maybe Charles does.
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
Look at the tiny figures.
Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
I don't know.
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
Why not?
Their wedding clothes.
I understand. I've seen it done before.
Now, you'll barely feel this. It won't hurt at all.
But not for long...
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
An attorney?
Yes.
There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
Yes, Robert. I will.
... Oh? You've heard?
How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
In a day or two, yes.
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
Yes, Robert - I am.  I'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert.
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
I wish he were here...
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
Certainly, glad to be of help.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
No sir, I don't believe I do.
Oh. I have a message for him.
Yes. I am.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Yes. Thank you.
Oh? Certainly...
My name is Chance.
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
No. I'm a gardener.
Yes. I lost my remote control.
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
Good night, Eve.
Hello, Eve.
Your leg must be getting better.
Yes. It's feeling much better now.
Our greenhouse.
Oh, I like that very much.
Yes, so do we.
Hello, Eve.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
How is Ben feeling?
Good night, Eve.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
Thank you.
Yes. I like to watch.
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
Hello, Eve.
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes, very well, thank you.
Do you like it?
Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
... Are you sure you like it?
Yes, I do, it's very good.
Really? Really!!!
I see.
Your foot! Give me your foot!!
So you know Krylov!
Yes, it is very good!
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
Yes. I like that name very much.
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
... So am I, my boy - so am I.
What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
And I'm Ben.
Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
Yes, Ben - he is.
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
Yes.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way, sir.
I never needed money.
Yes. Of men and women.
... Oh.
No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
Good day, Sally.
No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
Of course. I would like to look.
I've never ridden in an automobile.
Very good.
How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...
... Yes sir - elevator!
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
Yes. It is.
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes.
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
... How long have you been living here?
I was given meals, and a home...
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.
I would like to stay and work in my garden.
Good. That's good. Then if you would please sign a paper to that effect.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
I have no claim, Thomas.
Correct.
... Hello.
Sid, it's useless!
I said - try again.
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
That's good... That's good.
Good evening, Wilson.
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.
No, that won't do any good.
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve...
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
No! He's a real gardener!
Look, Johanna...
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
No, sir.
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
... Well?
I'm afraid so.
You take care too, Bobby.
Mr. Gardiner...
John Makel...
I never played a jewel thief.
I don't know.
Please, have a seat.
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
The monkey.
Yeah. Okay.
I'm a puppeteer.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
She's very beautiful.
Just an idea I had.
Hi.
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
The ferret?
The iguana.
Right.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
What?
I'm scared.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
I have to go back now.
We'll talk about it in the car.
Don't crowd me, Craig.
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. Well smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
You've always hated the animals.
You've always loved the animals.
Us, of course.
Fuck Maxine.
We wish.
And he was with her.
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
Me and John.
Don't forget me.
Life is confusing, isn't it?
Suck my dick!
Shut up!
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
I'm a puppeteer.
I love you so much.
The iguana?
The monkey.
I'm sorry for everything.
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Sure, after a fashion.
Let me try.
That... was... no... simulation.
I know. I'm sorry...
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
Pardon?
Schwartz.
Money, Miss Warts?
Yes?
Yex?
I said "yes."
I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
I wouldn't know.
I'm right?
Who told you?
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
You married?
Yeah. But enough about me.
The usual, Barry.
Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
Please, let me explain.
It better be.
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Tickets to Malkovich?
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
I've fallen in love.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
Hello. Wendy.
No. Don't be an ass.
Can I be anyone I want?
You can be John Malkovich.
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Fine. Let's drop it.
Forget it.
Fork ah did?
Think, Jew florist?
Good morning, Lotte!
Do you?
Says me. Do you dream often?
Do you?
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
But of course.
Count me in.
Oh, be still my heart.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
No you mustn't, my child.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
Oh, sorry. Right this way.
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.
I love you, Lotte.
Maxine...
One hour.
I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
Did you see the reviews?
Yeah, I saw them
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Never heard of it.
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
Is there dancing?
Mr. Malkovich?
Who's calling?
Whatever you're having.
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
No, I guess not. I'm an actor.
Yes, Maxine, yes.
No, Dollface, I know what my passion taking hold feels like. I gotta go.
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
I'm getting better all the time.
I'd love to see your work.
Really? Yeah. Okay.
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!
Vegas. Can you arrange that?
I've got to leave Malkovich.
You've got to be kidding.
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
Derek Mantini!
Whatever.
What want ye, girl child?
Then what do I do?
Folks come. Folks go.
Here, let me carry that.
Yonder. Twin chestnuts in the yard.
Well what?
That's the last thing they took from me.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
You getting into bed to think about yellow?
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
No, Stamp. I ain't.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
Not like He punished me.
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
Was a time I knew what was.
You still know.
No. I'm looking for what I was put here to look for: the back door.
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
and she is mine...
I WILL PROTECT YOU.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
THE WHITEFOLK?
You best leave that quilt alone. That was grandma's quilt.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN.
Baby, don't be like that.
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
You on your way home?
You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
Yes?
She gone like they say?
I don't. I have my own.
You grown.
Yes sir
Well, good luck with the job.
Thank you.
May I come in?
What you want?
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
What you want'em for?
Yes ma'am.
Be here. In case.
In case of what?
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
No. I mean work work.
Well, what can you do?
That was fun.
No, let her rest.
DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
Morning, ma'am.
Go upstairs I said!!
NO!...She wanted me to do it.
Mama?
Was over to Baby Suggs.
What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
You sure?
I know what I see.
Might see anything at all at 124.
Better ask Paul D.
Can't locate him.
He's sleeping in the church.
The church!
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
I don't know him that well.
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
Her who?
Till she showed herself.
Ella.
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
What run him off? Tell me that!
I run him off.
You?
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
Oh yeah. I got big plans.
Never found out.
It ain't what you think.
You don't know what I think.
She was only-
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
She what run you off? Not what I told you 'bout Sethe?
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
Paul D.
Yeah. Look bad?
No, You looking good.
You got to get up from here, girl.
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
She left me. She's gone again.
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
Yeah. Too sweet. 
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
What do you think?
He looks like a fuckin' loser.
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
You're not dealing with morons here.
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
Well Dude, we just don't know.
Her life is in your hands.
Oh, man, don't say that..
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
The?  Who the fff--
Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.
Yeah, it sucks.
NO RULES!  YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS- OF- BITCHES--
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!
Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.
I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
ANTI-SEMITE!
Nothing.
We have the urn.
That is for the urn.
Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes.
Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.
Yeah, but we're--
I am the Walrus.
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
Walter, how--
I'm going home, Donny.
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
Thank you, Donny.
I got eighteen dollars, Dude.
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
I was bowling--
Huh?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.
That fucking bitch!
What the fuck is he talking about?
That's fucking exactly what happened, Dude!  That makes me fucking SICK!
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.
WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!
What's that, Walter?
Went alright.  Dude's car got a little dinged up--
Where's your car, Dude?
Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.
They were Nazis, Dude?
Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
Are you gonna split hairs?
No--
Am I wrong?
Well--
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards.
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
Please, feel free to inspect them.
I'm not really, uh.
Uh-huh.
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
No, they--
Color?
And was there anything of value in the car?
And what do you do, sir?
I'm unemployed.
Your rug was in the car.
Separate incidents?
Mm.
Thankie. . . Just one thing, Dude. D'ya have to use s'many cuss words?
Yeah.  Thanks man.
Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.
Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
Yeah man.  Well, you know, the Dude abides.
White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
Yeah man.
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
Jeffrey Lebowski.
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
Excuse me?
You're not interested in sex?
You mean coitus?
No it's fine, really, uh--
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
Now I got--
I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--
The main guy, Dieter--
Dieter Hauff?
Well--yeah, I guess--
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
So Dieter has the money?
I want you to see him immediately.
Maude?
Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
I want a child.
This was a valued, uh.
Walter, he peed on my rug--
Am I wrong!
Yeah, but--
Okay. That, uh.
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
You mean--beyond pacifism?
He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!
Am I wrong!
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
Calmer than you are.
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
Just for making the hand-off?
What if it's during a game?
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.
It's your roll--
The fucking point is--
It's your roll.
My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. The whites.
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
It is a fucking game.  You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--
What the fuck is going on there?
Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
What the fuck?
C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
Aw, fuck it.
Whose toe was it, Walter?
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
Huh?
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
Near the In-and-Out Burger--
Huh?
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
The bulk of the series.
Uh-huh.
No.
Look, man, did you--
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!
Is this your homework, Larry?
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
Shit yeah!
What the fuck are you talking about?
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
You know this!
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
Sure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS! ACHTUNG, BABY!!
He can't walk, Walter!
Yeah, I can see that, Dude.
Hey, cool it Walter.
Come on, Walter!.
No Dude.
They shot Donny!
Then what's...
It's a heart attack.
Wha.
Call the medics, Dude.
Wha. . . Donny--
The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.
A hundred and eighty dollars?!
Walter--
Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!
Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
Dude, I'm sorry--
You're a fuck, Walter!
Who is this?
Yeah?
Okay, listen--
So no funny stuff.  Okay?
Right, Dude.
Friends like these, huh Gary.
I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
Employed?
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
Huh?
I don't know, sir.
Well we--I don't--
Where's the money, Lebowski?
You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you!
Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.
Am I wrong!?
A world of pain.
All right!  There it is!  It's fucking zero!
This is a league game, Smokey!
We'll take 'em in the morning.
<i>You'll</i> take him.
He's half yours, partner.
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
Survival.
No.  They've been training to hunt you.
The House of Pain.
Nothing.
What about Nomak?
Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.  There's something driving him beyond the Thirst.  Something we're missing.
I don't think so.
For what?
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
Not good.
I want to see the sun rise.
Did you think I wouldn't?
Took you long enough.
Sounds like a plan.
What do you really think?
I'm not giving you a choice, old man.
Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
I'll show you.
Where the hell have you been?
Just out connecting a few dots.
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
I should think that would be obvious at this point.
I don't know about this, man --
He was here.  Watching us.
Nomak?
You're wasting your time, Blade.  The flechette's a dud.
Getting your attention, Paco.
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.
You experimented on your own, son?
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
Maybe it's better that way.
Two so far.
No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
It depends.  We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.
Scud.
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.
Look, what's your problem?
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
Blade doesn't talk about anything much.  What about you, though?
After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
You should've killed her, then.
She hasn't turned yet.  You can help her.
Don't even start, old man.
How can you be out here?
Watch me.
Frost!!!
Take him.
You're blind --
But I just got here --
You've been here longer than you think.
I'm sorry, I --
You're joking --
Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
It worked, didn't it?
But, he could've --
He didn't. Get over it.
Preventive medicine.
It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
You don't know that.
What do you see here?
Graffiti --
Look closer.
The way they move, they way they smell --
There are worse things than vampires out there.
Like me.
Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
You get used to the darkness.
Blade --
Cancer.
Some. It's been slow --
You don't look so good.
You make it sound like I'm already dead.
I've been better --
How long have we been driving?
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
What are you talking about?
I'm not leaving without you.
You don't understand. The Thirst --
I know. Take some of my blood.
You're a week early.
I was in the neighborhood.
I was afraid that might happen.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
There's only one alternative to the serum.
Deacon brought me back.
Fight him --
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
Then what is it?
I don't know --  Look at this blood smear --
This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
What?
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
The other elders will never let you get away with this!
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
You've been listening in the whole time?
Go on, I'll be fine!
We weren't sure we could trust you.
Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like Hemolytic anemia?
--which she may have--
Hey, folklore--
Because it means the tree is older than the house.
Try, please, Anna--
What happened to her, where did she go?
Don't know--just that she was afraid--
My eye, is there something in my eye?
Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
Closer.
I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
Bullshit! Talk!
Nick!!
Yes.
What're you doing there?
Trying to find the energy.
Sometimes. Where are we going?
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
Mrs. Leavitt--
Let's talk to your husband--
--he's not my husband!
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
--a six week bun in the oven--
The Witch's voice.
Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
So whoever built this--
Oh, sorry, right.
That's a joke?
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
What?
You sure?
<u>Yes</u>.
It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus--
Okay, fine, whatever, yes--it's an <u>old</u> tree.
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
Your body, your call.
You feel no need to get married or anything.
--fine, later, fine.
You said the name "James."
I don't know.
I don't know. Nightmare.
No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
We've looked at half of one tape.
--bullshit!
Get your goddamn--
Sleep.
--you should get back into bed.
I guess, yeah.
What?
No.
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
What'd you dream?
Then I'm going--
Whatever you want.
Why?
Beta Cam's still coming back tomorrow, right?
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
--hours before--
The, uh, blur there.
Looks like a rope.
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
I can't let you in.
I want amphetamines.
--yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think stole the stuff!?
--no, I think they're all in there.
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
Well, please keep me fucking informed!
--there's something <u>here</u>, Nick--
Fine.
Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
Who do you know who can? Where do we go?
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
Four in the morning?
It's not about witches, goddamnit!
Hey, Mr. Graduate Fucking Thesis here was s'posed to be driving!
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
I do.
Shut-up.
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
I've got the Panasonic Portable DVD player.
Ask me what I don't have.
No fucking.
No.
Try a long walk.
Butt-ugly owl.
What're you, nuts?
--coming out of the water--
What?
Too busy eating us?
Just go.
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
Still don't see it--
My room, asleep, last I checked.
Don't have one.
Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
Fucking owl!
Down there in the Park.
How's she going to know where to--
--things got a way of finding <u>you</u> here.
Next time try putting on shoes--
--I don't know.
Yeah. Me too.
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
<u>What</u>--
--before you lose your emotional lunch.
For "James?"
No one ever comes here.
--shhhh! #5, there's something up there!
What?
The wheel.
--about the Witch--
--a Wiccan--
--turn the goddamn camera off!
This isn't about us.
Right. And the check's in the mail.
Look over there.
--now there.
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
--I dunno, I just woke up--
First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
All I need--
A Cyber Entrepreneurialship.
--oh, Jesus--
--still go see the OB in the morning--
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
It's not a real "funny" time for us, okay?
I think it's time to get out of here.
I can't!
--it's less than four feet, just--
One of the printers.
Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
I thought the movie was bitchin'.
Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.
Ah, Domini?
What?
Smells Like Teenage Spirit.
At least you still have the tapes.
No. I don't think so.
Why she kills children.
--and we brought it back with us!
--no.
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
Motion. Stop there. Play it again.
He'll never know.
Elly Kedward?
What'd you say?
....I don't know.
What?
I know, I know--
Get some more beer.
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
Whatever.
--I know!
I'm sorry.
Heather.
Yeah.
Okay. Hypothetically.
Shoot.
We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
Don't! You're making me lose my grip.
Or a blood blister--or a bruise.
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
She's far from "fine."
You're needed here--keep watching--
Anna--
--fuck Anna!
I thought all witches were benign and good.
Does she, goddamnit??
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
--the Sheriff's Office--
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
Your mother's pastor.
What happened to my Dad??
Well I do...
Sort of...
Yeah.
Your husband.
See a guy.
What?
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?
You got a girl--am I screwing something up by being here?
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
You wouldn't be putting me out.
...Well, I'd be okay in here--
Door's locked. Nothing there.
I couldn't believe it either...
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
Well, I didn't see him anymore, I'll tell you that much.
When you don't they're usually nice.
...You ever get tired?
Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm-hmm.
Abby... you all right?
Ray?... What time is it?
I don't know. It's early... I love you.
Abby--
I said you're bad.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Marty.
All right...
In the trunk.
Isn't that what you want?
What do you want to know?
I think someone's watching.
You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew.
About ten years.
Going out with Meurice.
We don't seem to be communicating--
Christ, I'm getting bored.
Ever durned one.
What night is it?
...Friday?
See, I never knew that.
Well now you do.
...Hell.
No.
What's the matter?
Back where?
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
You owe me for two weeks.
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
How long did you watch her?
Most of the night...
No. It just made them feel better.
Got a job for you.
Well what?
What do you think?
You're an idiot.
Ya catch any fish?
...What?
Ya catch any fish?
Yeah...
...What kind of fish?
Listen, what is it? Is it done?
Got something to show me first?
So it would seem.
Nobody knows you hired me?
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
Nah, I trust ya.
Has Ray come in yet?
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
I don't know, didn't he call?
You said the usual--
Right. Sorry.
Pour that back.
What.
Don't throw that out.
Right.
What.
This.
That's not the point.
What's the point?
Where?  ...I'm very careful about that.
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
For what?
Tuesday is ladies' night.
What?
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
No. I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
I've seen a few.
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.

Twice. without her sensing anything?

On the plane.
My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.
You'll see for yourself.

I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in front of your parents.
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Yes, I am.
Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
Tell me about the suitcases.  What is the make and the color?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes.
The coca is my responsibility!
You're a fucking amateur!
Excuse me?
We want some grass.
It's your grass.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
It's your grass.
Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight.
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
It's already been negotiated.  It's done.  The money is there waiting.
Barbara and me.  No one else.
Not bad for a weekend's work, huh?
Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
Yeah.  She told me.
For calling you a homo.
That was out of line.
I know.  She needs to slow down.  She's going to blow an O-ring.
Fuck you, then.  I sign nothing.
What's that?
Get me a six pack.
I don't want to talk about it.
Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
No?
Ah, yes.  The murder.
Nothing.  Just a little project.
What kind of project?
Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
No, my brother.
Because they caught me?
You failed because you had the wrong dream.
Now do you see what I am saying?
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
Great.  I love the Bahamas.
Allo?
Diego?  It's George.
Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
How are we doing?
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
Well, you better get here fast.  I'm sitting on...
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.
We're half a million off.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
Try the back bedroom.
Try the closet.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
I love you too, man.
What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's for peace of mind.  It's for the principle.
Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos?
What?
I did not.
No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never.
Cocaine?  How much?
In how long?  A week?
Today.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.
Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad?
I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap.
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
Power?
Yeah, maybe.
Family.
Sure.
Beautiful girls?
Keep them coming.
And Diego?
Yeah, well...
Diego?
Yeah.
I didn't come here to drink scotch.
Of course, George.  We are beautiful. We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not like Diego.  We started this, George.
I'm going to California.
I'm going to California.
Not mad.
Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
No.
Good.
I'll tell her.
I meant every word of it.
What do you guys want?
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
What about him?
He's going down, George.  It's election year.  We're not making any deals.
Figured what out?
Tuna.
Figured what out?
Tuna.
Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here?
Hello.
Do I know you?
I don't think so.
Why are you smiling?
Why are you smiling?
I don't know.  My name is George.
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
She did that before.
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
But this is...
I said, I've seen it before.
Out.
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
Don't touch me.  Tell me.  Just answer the question.  What do I spend?  What? How will we live?
Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
Yeah, you will.  Of course.
Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.
Is she here?  Is she coming?
Better than you.
Are we gonna split up?
How are you doing?
What?
Do what you want, it's a free country.
Yeah, sure, whatever.
I don't know.  Maybe California.
You swear?
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
Swear on my life.
I swear on your life.
It's alright, Dad.
I didn't mean to...
I know, Dad.  I know...
Shhhh.
Because she's visiting me.
We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's lockdown time.
Yes, I do.
Let the record state the witness has identified, Diego Delgado.
They're over at the booth.
Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
What?
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
That's right.
Cheer up, man.  Half this money is ours. We're fucking rich.
Don't be such a pussy.
No. It has failed in its objective.
Exactly.
And here?
It depends on you.
Second name.
Sail.
Second district ...
Second district ... Explain better ...
What "group"?
Third group.
Third group. What's your assignment?
Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
Don't move, Hacene.
What's happened to you?
The NLF has condemned you to death.
You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!
I'll explain.
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
Then don't complain.
Not enough.
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
Sure ...
Here?
It's a question of habit ...
It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
Good evening, sir.
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
Good evening, sir.
A name?
Yes, a name for the operation.
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...
Yes ... But let me first see you.
Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the Marsh case?
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
You got something on the coke?
No -- but I got something.
What would Joanne Braslow need with an estate attorney?  She wasn't even mentioned in Marsh's will.
Thanks, Mister D.
Then you can go.
Cause?
That's what my report will read.
But there's more?
Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene?
A massive cardiac arrest.
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
What induced it?
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
Like cats and dogs.
What did they argue about?
Could you be more specific?
Your witness.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
You may call your next witness.
Counsel approach the bench.
You're bluffing.  John, it's me, remember?  I've known you since your name was Juan Carlos.
Aren't they all?
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
I didn't hear it.
The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
You get his statement?
I have.
No.  I haven't done it in years.
Why did you come by?
I had some papers to pick up.
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
I assume his girlfriend.
Rebecca Lawson.
No -- but I can get it for you.
What about Miss Lawson?
Yes.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
What did Mr. Marsh say?
Yeah.
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
She was here?
Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
How long were you together?
For about one year.
I had a bad heart.
I had bypass surgery.
And how are you now?
Why not?
She left me.
She didn't.  She just left.
Why do you think she left you?
Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that...
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson?
Who was your primary beneficiary?
She was.
Thank you.  The State rests.
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
Did you ever see her again after that?
We stopped seeing each other.
Why?
Yes -- Insulin and others.
What did she say?
I was angry.
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
Why does she come to you?
She suffers from severe menstrual cramps.
It's a white powder that comes in a vial.
High school?
No.
Then -- those are not your own words?
We dated for about a month last year.
Yes -- he did.
No.
What about Miss Lawson?
Yes -- cocaine.
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
Yes.  I suppose it's possible.
That bastard!
You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
A.M -- or P.M.?
P.M.
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
Frank -- what are you doing here?
No further questions.
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
Something like that.
I thought the subject was sex?
How?
Because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it.
Sure.  Where to?
I know.
No -- it just doesn't look right.
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
I'm the photographer.
That's not an answer.
It's not my taste.
Tastes can change.
Hi, Frank.
No -- not at the office.  I've got a better idea.
It's okay.
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
Yeah.
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
What would?
You and me -- making love.
Is that what you think I was thinking?
No -- that's what I know you were thinking.
You take a lot for granted.
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
I went out on the boat.
Of course.
It's only the beginning.
You can see me now.
Paley could be a problem tomorrow.
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
What does that mean?  You've been thinking about the case?  Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?
Honey.
Tonight we open new doors.
Are you scared?
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
He was only doing what he thought was right.
No -- you're not.
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
She's waiting in the conference room.
Is Mom yelling at you too?
I love you too, Dad.
Why?
Because I'm expecting a call.
-- But it's Sunday.
I gotta go.  I'll call you later.
That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.
Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
Mr. Roston?
You better.  Please answer the question.
Really?
Really.
I'm always open to learning new things.
I know.  What can I do?  He is the boss.
He could let you have your vacation.
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
If he files are you going to take the case?
Yeah -- but can she cook?
Yes.
Why don't you talk to him now?
No one's asking you not to work.  I just think you could make some time for your son.
Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.
We have to talk.
What's wrong?
Because I knew you'd think exactly what you're thinking.
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael.
Talk to me.
Why didn't you come to me?
I don't know.
It was a place to start.
That's too bad.
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
Daddy -- stop it!
We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
What time did you leave?
Six thirty -- and he was very much alive.
No -- never.
It had to get there somehow.
It didn't get there from me.
We were here two Christmases ago.
It's not that long.
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
Why are there two deeds here?
I said NO!
I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
No treasure maps, huh?
No.
No. You can have them.
Lawyer here?
Well, there's a problem.
What problem?
Michael.
What?!
Come here a minute.
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
This happened way before we both got married. I... I can't believe it.  You think she had sex with him?
Well, what am I supposed to think?
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
I bet mom could've helped her.
Nobody did.
Was this during Betty?
She used to be so friendly.
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
She changed.
Not this kind of heat.
Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
That's it.
Hmm-mmm.
That must be it. It's a great smell.
After the divorce.
Oh.
How long you been married?
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
No, really?
I found this Chicago station before. Wait a minute...  Here it is.
Sure.
Francesca. Robert.
Sure.
Not at all.
About a year and a half.
No, your kids.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Why?
Clean?
Yes. Very clean.
Much.
I think so.
She starts sniffing me.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
We got engaged.
Oh you!
Why, do you think?
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
They have safaris for tourists now. Maybe you can convince your husband.
You get used to it.
When?
No. I'm all right. It's working.
Francesca?
What?
Are you all right?
Yes.
Francesca?
What?
I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
But no one in particular.
No. But I love them just the same.
But it's not the same.
What made you ask such a question?
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
Am I interrupting anything?
No. I was just... No.
I would love to come for dinner.
I'll pick you up.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
I want you to come.
Oh, how is he?
Yes, that'd be nice.
Are you hungry?
No.
What?
Yes.
How about Bari?
Have you ever been to that station?
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
Why do you say that?
Because I already tried once.
No, I don't mind.
I had a temper.
What were your parents like?
What?
Am I too heavy for you?
Yes, thanks.
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
TO HELL WITH YOU!
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
Where you going?
I can't sleep.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
I'm going to miss you.
It's only four days.
Hmm?
Nah.
What's her name?
Betty.
What's she like?
Okay.
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
What happened?
They're not going to find her!
Yes, they are.
Apparently just before her death.
You people really don't like dogs.
Some holes can't be filled.  Some hungers can't be satisfied.
It's the only way.  It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
He yours, sir?
Hell no!
Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.
How the hell should I know?
Yeah?
So what the hell's the good news?
Damn.  It's so...fresh.
Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
Naw.  I think it's... I dunno.  Something about it just buzzes me.
Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
Spooked?
Yeah, there is a strange vibe here.
Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
Anywhere but here.
Or just Hell-adjacent...
That's some terrible shit.
Bones.
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
But things change.  You gotta think ahead.
Go on.  It won't kill you.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
Where we'll always be...
Hush, baby.
Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when we was his age...
Since we was just grasshoppers...
How did you get in here?
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
Then fuck it!!!
I have to finish this for class.
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
Please.  It's for your own good.
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
Your father.  He was your father.
Girl, they build gates like that to keep people like us out.
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
How do you know?
I manage them.
That place is already bad luck.
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
And you believe her?
What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.
I'm sure I can make your mother like me. But then do I gotta worry 'bout your father?
It's alright.  If you want to go home...
My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.
Bill!  Bill?!
Patrick, he's...
Here!
I can't!
Back here.  At the end of the block.
You got the shit?
Let me see it.
Where is it?
Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
Dad?
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
Well, somebody bought it.  That's what I heard.
That's it.  Get out.  Now!
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
No time for eightball.  I got your tip.
I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
It was just like in my head.
You haven't?
Not that I remember.
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
Why not?  He eats everything else.
The blood is still there.  We just gotta figure out where.
Then your father's a dead man and Jimmy Bones is gonna be around a long time.
How could that be?  The box was packed!
Ours!
What we have to do is call the police.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
Here, put this in his mouth.
You want to get into this now?
No, no, Caesar.  Not now.
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
Two point one seventy-six.
Just admit it, Caesar.
Admit what?
Open the case!
All right!  Where's the key?
You don't need a key.
The same way you did before.
What are you talking about?
I think you're fucking crazy!
Where is it?
Where's what?
The money!
Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
Stay away!
No!
I can't.  I can't.
Give it to me.
All part of the business.
What the fuck is going on?
Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
Jesus, Caesar!
It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
What are you going to do with it?
Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
I'm sorry.  It was an accident.
There's no time.
What are you talking about?
They just left, didn't they?
What are you, drunk?
No!  They're still on their way.
That doesn't make any sense.
Why?
It was him.  I'm positive.
It's impossible!
Caesar, maybe we should run --
Violet, please!
For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
They're just cops.  Stall them as long as you can.
Caesar, someone could see us out here.
Where, then?
We're going to need some time.
Don't tell him --
He can't kill you --
Don't try to tell me what to do.
Everything you couldn't.
You murdered Gino!
I had to.  You made me.
They were in a car accident.
But everybody is all right.
I should have let him kill you.
You know he would have done you, too.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
Oh, right.
Where's the fucking money?
No.  Rajeev's in India.
Five.
I should be going.
What?  How about a drink?
Sure.
Where is it?
Why?
I could be lying.
Hey, Mickey.
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
Caesar, you still got the money?
I thought I heard someone knocking.
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
Me?  Why?
Hey, if Violet was helping me relax, I'd probably do the same thing.
Yeah, that's it.
Fuck it, I don't need the key.
Where in the hell is he?
Oh yeah.  Violet!
Leave your phone on the hook.
This is the police, ma'am.
How do I know you are cops?
...  thank you.
Pretty much.  One day at a time.
Good guess.
Yeah.
Truck.  Of course.
I knew it.
I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind.
My pleasure.
Yeah, come on in.
What do you want?
A beer?
A beer.  Of course.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
...  yes.
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
Tell me about it.
No.
Almost five years.
Five years is a long time.
What?
I'm glad you did.
So am I.
Nothing.
You didn't want to see me, did you?
I'm not afraid of anything.
I don't understand - ?
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
What the fuck was it?
Work.
You mean Shelly?
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
I think so, too.
Then what?  Exactly.
He hung it up.
What?
To let it dry.
In his office.  I saw it this morning.
Does the case lock?
Good.
Like each other?  They hate each other.
...  shit.
Sweet Jesus.
What happened?
Has Caesar ever seen him?
He does it right in front of him.
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Waiting in the apartment next door.
He won't.
If he does ...
The same way I'll know that you went to Scotch.  Trust.
Why?
You'll be clean and we'll be rich.
Thank you.
What happened?
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
We're almost there, Violet.  just hang on.
I'm still here.
Don't be sorry.  Help me.
Hey.
How'd it go?
I'm here, aren't I?
...  Me neither.
Hey, Johnnie ...
I think everything is okay.
Violet?
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
I'm not asking.
-- if we can get a clean shot --
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
What do you want to do?
We don't know what we're into!
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
I can't call it off.  He's not responding.  Get out of my way.
...which one are you?...
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
What do they want me to do?
...they won't let you go...
Why?
That's all I get?
We have to go home, Jason.
Jason Bourne is dead.
That'll be their second worst mistake.
Get the kids out!
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
You have your passport?
Look, maybe I should just...
Yeah, I know...

Paris?
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
Yes, I'm here...
Yes.  Is he there?
His brother.  You know his brother?
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
Excuse me?

It's a little late for that.
I've got a situation here and --
Get the fuck away from my car.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
I want to go home.
For twenty thousand dollars.
You have blood on your pants.
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
What if I say no?
Then I'll find another ride.
What does that mean?
Listen to what you want.
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...

I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
I don't know.
I was shot twice in the back.
Okay, so you're a victim.
We're about an hour away.
I can't believe I slept.
I thought about it.  I don't know.
That's it?  Is that it?
No.  No.  Go around.  Keep going...
I guess.
I don't remember any of this.
Thanks for the ride.
Anytime.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
-- quiet -- <u>quiet</u> --
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
No.
I trusted you.
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
I didn't know this would happen.
-- there's no time --
-- we'll explain it --
-- how? --
-- we'll tell them what happened --
It's a company... MPG Capital.
Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
Go back to the hotel.
xxxxxx
What?
xxxxxx
I won't let that happen.
xxxxxx
We have to keep moving.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
I can't protect you anymore.
What about you?
This your store?
Yes.
You have ID?
Not really.
So get the hell out of here.
-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
My husband's out looking for him.
He run away often?
What?
I'm sorry.
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
xxxxxx
That's the only angle.
What's that?
-- I'm on it --
Abbott wants to talk.
I tried.
-- he accessed the account --
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
I told you.  You need to rest.
I don't know.
Uh - what? - I ...
Thank you.
What have you done to my flat?
...elephoned sir.
...ditioning.
Machines don't fix themselves.
...ampered. with it, Spoor.
... have a look.
Got there!
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
... ere please.
What? How do you know my name?
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
We know that too. You've come to the right place.
You must save the day.
It's reply paid.
You don't have to sing it.
Oh, right ...
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Her name is Jill.
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
He will be pleased when he comes home.
Well, I ...
Well ... well, I ...
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
I understand, Sam, I know exactly how you feel. So I brought you a bottle of barley water.
Jack!
Long time no see!
Even later.
Really? - God, how time flies!
You remember Alison?
Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
SAM! What a surprise!
Are you officer 412/L?
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
What?
What is it?
How much do you know?
Not much.
Enough though, eh?
Not really, no.
Christ! You do know it all!
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
He's a freelance subversive?
Very smart.
Yes. I'm impressed.
Tell me about Layton.
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Out of kindness.
So what are you going to do about her?
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
You're the only person I can trust.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
Say it was a mistake.
We don't make mistakes.
Do you know what you're doing.
Trust me.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
Yes we have, Jack!
Shut up!
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
Bastard!!!
Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
How do you think I feel? You shit!
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
Is it stamped?
Stamped?
Information Adjustments.
You think these are tits don't you?
It's you ... it's you ...
Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
Don't look back! Act naturally!
Good!
Please!
Oh, sorry.
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
I don't know.  Hey, that's not a very nice thing to say.
It's my fucking life.
Yes, of course. Sorry.
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
I didn't like it.
Why not?
What?
Where are you taking me?
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
Where are you taking me?
What parcel?
A heavy Christmas present.
Looking for you.
No, really.
Really.
Suit me?
What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
They couldn't be worse for the Buttles.
Well, no system is.
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Who is this war against, Sam?
Well, terrorists of course.
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's only my first day.
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Turn around!
What?
They'll be there waiting.
Who will?
Security.
You're joking.
I thought you arrested me.
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 
Cut it out, Sam.
Will you please turn back.
Get away!
Turn!
Stop it ... damn you!
Let go! We've got to stop!
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
Oh God! What have we done?
We? Don't blame me!
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
Shit! The house is on fire!
"And your children all gone."
Please, Jill ... I love you.
Go away.
Oh ... Jesus!
No you're not!
What happened to you after ...
Your face ... are you hurt?
Are you sure?
Yes.
C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
Take care.
It's not our mistake!
Information Retrieval.
Oh, good!
But if they did promote you
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
Would you really, Sam?
Really.
You've been promoted.
The refund for Tuttle!
Tuttle?
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
You are good to me Sam.
Don't mention it. See you later.
Can I forget it?
What's the matter?
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
I did it for you.
What! Shit!
It's what you wanted isn't it?
Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
You want to take my console into your office?
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
You haven't switched it on.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
I won't be held responsible.
How long will she he away?
I'm sorry but ...
You remember Samuel, my son.
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
We're meeting Mrs Terrain.
I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
This isn't rare!
Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course you want something. You must have hopes, wishes, dreams.
I want to talk to him.
I know, I know ...!
Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are you going to have?
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
Thank you for calling Cen -
Hello. Mr Lowry?
Who's that? 
What? Who is this?
Er, don't you want to search me?
No need, sir
But I could be anybody.
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
Ah yes, the lady is waiting.
Numero, trois.
Central Services.
Fixed itself.
Have you got one or haven't you?
Not ... as such ...
Emergency procedures.
What is it?
Who fixed your ducts?
Thermostat's gone. And then some.
It's a 27B/6 of course.
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
But ... I called Central Services.
Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm -
No. Wait here.
Time to go.
On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor.
I've never fired anyone in my life.
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
No, no, that's impossible.
Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
She say she in great pain.
Thanks for the translation.  What's your name? Nombre?
She's having a baby. Twins.
Es impossible.
It's a miracle.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
In that time, you ever have sex?
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
We are virgins.
Mary ...
He looks like a cop.
He flipped out.
Mary said you might be coming.
Sleeping in the back.
She asked me to pick her up.
Just take it easy.
No!
You're going to live.
What about Kanita?
Dead.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
He's going to be all right, right?
No. He's dead.
No way, man.
IB Bangin.
What did you say?
Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
No, I'd better not.
Sure, sure, give go.
What?
His heart's beating.
We'd better go outside. Quickly.
I guess there's always a chance.
The first is always the best.
At least he's got people around him.
That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second, then I could take her home.
Yes.
I think this place stinks.
Our Lady of Misery.
Did you see my father?
No.
Sleeping.
He's better.
Not as good as Nino's.
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
How long you been doing this?
Five years.
No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend.
You asked me not to come.
Promise you won't go inside.
Fifteen minutes.
Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.
There's no time.
Frank.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
I think the worst is over.
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
God help us, he's hungry too.
What's that, Frank?
Three legs.
That's too many.
Backup?
It's coming.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
Greatest job in the world.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
Crazy fucker.
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
He was tough. You did all you could.
No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.
Yeah. Great, isn't it?
C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.
I've taken that into consideration.
You okay?
It's early for him.
Better bring it all.
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
C'mon, look at your screen. Give up some blood!
Who with?
What do you want to break?
You learn that in the army?
Do it!
Frank!
What?
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
What?
You know what. The radio.
Don't push it, Larry.
You're burned out.
They'll just keep calling.
He's drunk.
Faster!
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
You really think so?
Used to be my partner.
You sure?
No way!
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
You've made my dreams silly.
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
There are only ten.
What's wrong with it?
What?
Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
Just don't physically...  Fantastic tip -- fantastic.
I'll find some copy.  Be right back.
No?
The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
I'll put her on.
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
Why?  What did they do to you?
London.  That's a promotion!
I don't think so.
I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.
Are you any closer to a decision?
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
Yes.
That's your full name?
Yes.
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
Which would you prefer?
Ravenous homosexual.
Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>].
No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
Why do you say that?
I'd give anything if that were true.
Eleven and a half.
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
Did you shoot their boots?
Of course.
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
Not because you have to.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
Good.
Did you bring your grey suit?
Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
Yes.
Then it went well.
Did it really go well?
Define your terms.
Do you feel good about it?
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
Hi.  Will I ever sing again?
Speaking.
I'm going to take it.
Well -- my wife got this new job...
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
No -- Don't worry about it.  Let's do this.
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
I'm gonna go look at it again.
Yeah --
Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Upper management thinks you're dull.
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
I understand.  I'll go with you.
So I quit.
No.
Move away from me.
Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
It depends on how big a news day it is.
What is she shooting?
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
Oh, come on -- tell us another.
Yes.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
I'll never tell.
I liked it.  He's not afraid to be human.
Yes?
He said something about...
Let me hear it!
Just a two-second dissolve.
No stop where he's all besieged.
Right there, Bobbie.
No, I don't think so.
How do I get out of here?
You talked me into it.
Yes.  That's right.
One's enough.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
I see the change in you -- I see it.
I wish it were you giving the story.
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
I'll speak to you.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
They fired me.
Okay, sweetie.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
Why so glum?
I don't know.
Go ahead.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
As long as that's your only problem you're...
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
I'll just have to try harder.  I don't know.  I will.  I will.  I will.  I will.
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
It's not opinion.
Fill for a second.
I was a lot earlier.
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
How's it going?
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
Yes.
Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie and I serve anonymously.
You're great at taking the edge off a good time.
Excited.
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
Yeah?
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
I'll get you through.  Move and smile.  And smile and move...
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
Why, you need me for the story?
No.  Were you going to you?
Uh-huh.
We can go together.
Who?
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
This is hysterical.
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
Where are you?
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
Yes.
Okay.  Good night.
Good night??!
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
You fucking...
You want to come?
It's better when you let me say it.
Go ahead -- what?
I can't be.
Right back to you.
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
Through the closet.
I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm sorry.
The way you were looking at me, I just went.
Not anymore!
I just might.
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
What, right now?
Uh-huh.
Shh!
Oh it's enough...
Are you nervous, Walter?
N-no...
I already told you I'm not.
You're breaking my concentration!
Are you a virgin?
I'll pose any way you want.
You know it.  I'm out of here.
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
What did he do?
He made a cat.
Righto.
A thing I made.
Of course...it's wonderful.
It's a...full length life-size figure!
What's it called?
Murdered man.
Yeah it was all just an accident.
You can do anything you want if you set your mind to it.
Now you're a professional!
Carla...
Better!
Well I can't say that Walter!  She's incomparable.  They're both great.
There there...
Sorry...
Yes Walter.
All about me...
Every word...
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
Thank you.
Are you ready?
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
I know.  But I wanted to talk to you.
Hm...
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
Of course I do!
That means you like me!
Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.
Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
What?
Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
Is it?  I've forgotten.
I hope this was made with egg whites!
What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
I'm honored to know this man.
Do you have to be so cold to him?
I'm totally serious!
Nothing...nothing at all.
You see the direction his realism takes! It's unhealthy!
Well, it all depends, Leonard...
Not only that, he copied us!
I know.
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Let's check out the scene.
Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?
Didn't you hear him?
No man I'm on my own plane.
Maxwell gave him a bottle of wheat germ oil.  Maybe he started taking it.
Yeah, right outside the door!
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
What is it, your laundry?
Huh?
I didn't buy it I made it.
I said I did, didn't I!
Dead Cat?
Yeah.
You want me to buy Dead Cat?  It'll scare people away.
Got carried away, huh?
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
Good night Walter.
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
What, Mr. De Santis?
You might talk too much.
Yeah and what would I say?
Just wait till you see this!
Put it down, Walter.
Never mind...
Excuse me I have to make a call...
Uh, hi.
Did you see my cat?
You're like an undercover guy!
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
NO YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME DON'T SHOOT -
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Yes, get rid of them...
Did you like it Mister Brock?
Uh, I don't know.
Good morning Walter!
Hiya Maxwell.
Why not?
I don't!  But fifty thou?  That's not money, that's manna!
What do you get?
Your work, the layers of irony.
T-turned on?
Then let me give you something then...
If you see him.
OK Mrs. Swicker.
Good night, Mrs. Swicker -
Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.  Somebody's got to.
What's the matter with you!
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
Shut up!  You let him have it!
Cheer up.  You may still.
I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Let's move out!
Yes!
Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.
Suck!
Wrong answer!  No prize.
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
We're looking at a dog, possible coffee...
Amazing!
We hate you guys!
Bummer metaphor.
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?
You look like shit, Benny.
Get away from here.
I'm hungry.
I mean it.
Which way did she go?
Down there.
What's playing there?
Probably.  What movie is this?
Eeyuu.
Hi, guys.
Uum... around ten?
Yeah?
What's Bobby gonna say?
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
Aren't we the chatty ones.  Kiss noise.
I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
It's the news, Buffy.
You were having a nightmare.
Nothing.
Come on, what was it?
Nothing.  It was just a dream.
Hi.
I do?  I guess I do.
I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
So I noticed.
I thought we were meeting here.
I'm here with Jenny.
You broke up with my machine?
You weren't home.  Like always.
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
I think you've forgotten something.
I am so sure.
It could happen.
Hi there.
Is that your car?
Water.  Okay.
They were vampires, weren't they?
God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.
Where are you gonna go?
Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
I'll back that up.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
Yeah?
Why'd you come back?
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
Merrick...
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
Dress, huh?  What for?
For the dance.
Come again?
Second word... sound like 'dance'.
What for?
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
Pretty shallow of you.
That's me.
I'm glad you came.
Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
Get away from me!
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.
Bogutude.  Blow it off.
I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
) What do you think?
Please.  It's so '91.
Why don't we see a movie?
Well, where?
Nice ensemble!
'Just remember you're in training, son'
Where?
Cafe Blase.
Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
Get out of my facial.
You look way pretty, Kim.
I know.  I like your little outfit.
Am I in trouble or something?
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
To bring you... your birthright.
My birthright?  You mean, like a trust fund?
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
In Virginia.
I have to show you.
None of your business.  God.
This is it.
We wait for Robert to wake up.
She --
I have cheerleading squad.
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
We'll cover it later.
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
Sporting events, yeah.
Who we gonna beat?
No -- you don't have to --
Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
But you threw a knife at my head!
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
I don't think you understand the full implications of --
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
Same one.
Oh.
Try to pay attention.
You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps.
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
A what?
Five.
How can you keep doing this?
It isn't important.
I'm curious, is all.
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
Vampires of the world, beware.
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.
He knows who I am!
Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.  Ooh!
They don't even have Dolby.
No.  It was mondo bizarro.
Thank you very much.
Nobody is even gonna look at the game.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
I guess.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Thanks.
Later for it.
Hi.
Oh.
So very much.
My parents have money...
Swear to God.
I don't understand.
You are much more.
Hi, Grueller.
You think so?
Could be.
Good.
Okay, what else?
Oh, baby!
Jeffrey!
Okay, let's go.
But --
Where'd you learn how to do that?
Okay.
Nee sitch.  No way.
What is she...
Does Jeffrey know?
Hey, wait a minute...
You want some punch?
He is so bald.
Like we don't have rights too?
Oh, please.
Okay.
Right!
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
Nice much.
Like you've got a grip.
Right.
As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
No...  You want me to give him a message?
I don't think so.
All right.  Take care of yourself.
I am.
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
You said "Crash".
They did when they were in the Carolina League.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
My right nostril?
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
He's handled a lotta pitchers whose records were better than one and six.
A little better.
Just till I lose.
Get over here.
No.
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh--
How 'bout a back rub?
No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
You can't seduce me.
I'm not gonna try to seduce you, sweetie...
I know what it is.
Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
I'm trying to play with your body!
I knew it--you're seducing me!
You're exotic and mysterious and cute--that's why I better leave.
What'd he say?
it's okay..
Oh--won't YOU come in?
--but you're father's in there!
Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
How can I possibly thank you?
I won't be needing these anymore.
I think I'm ready for the Show.
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place
He's a virgin.
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
I don't dance.
I'll learn.  C'mon--
G'night.
Yep.
So...Wanta make love?
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
You're pulling your hips out.
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
Let me.
You got me all confused.
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
Aren't we all?
Don't you think I'm pretty?
He won't make love to me anymore.
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
I'm ready for a complicated man.
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
Annie, I think you should leave.
No.
I heard already.
Yeah...you a witch?
Not yet.  It takes years of practice...
What?
Three-fourteen?  Hmmm...  Look't those thighs, Jackson
He looks great, just great!
Ninety-five miles an hour...
That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
He looks wonderful, Jackson...
Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?
She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ...
You need a nickname.
That's what I been telling everybody!  Wanta dance?
Oh both of you, of course...
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
The socks?  It's cold in here.
You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on?
Who's he play for?
If you believe in Voodoo.
I'm 0 for 16!  Gimme some of that shit.
C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!
You missed him!
It was a cocksucking call!
Did you call me a cocksucker?
You spit on me!
I didn't spit on you!
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
You're outta here!
Don't think.
Awright, meat, give him your heat.
Well, I held it like an egg.
How?
I told him.
God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
I won't have to.
God--what a Big League move.
What?
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
Yep.  So how's Annie?
Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.
Then go.
Let go of me!
C ' mon!
Why am I a fuck?
What?
Forget it.
I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.
Yeah, thanks for everything.
You too...Meat.
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?
Crash, shut the door.
Love to--
Pussy.
I ain't hitting a man first.
Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
It's a damn easy thing to play with.
See ya at the yard, Meat.
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
We're getting married.
Ain't he warning up?
C'mon big 'un, you're okay...
It's a league record.
Struck out eighteen...
Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
...and one helluva guy.
It's a damn convention.
Check it out.
Jim looking for somebody.
Who ain't?
Ain't here.
I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
Well, I'd rather not say.
Don't tell him I told you--he'd break my neck.
...he did what he was told.
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
What?
I can't believe you're doing this.
Good to see ya.  William would you...
That's right.
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
A powerful man.
Philip, if you would rise.
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
I'm serious. No interference.
Watch it, partner, watch it!
The worst was Blue.
Yeah.
Congratulations.
Wait, hold on a second.
Hey!
Hold on a second.
You fuckin' piece of shit.
Hey, little Dale Evans.
Hello.
Lester...
Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
I'll call you right back.
Help, Daddy!
I can't! I'm tied!
Wh-wh -
I don't know.
Ohhh...
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
If his girlfriend was knocked up.
How did Nicky collect?
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
Somethin', huh?
Yeah.
Ginger.
It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
All right, Ace?
Okay.
Thanks, pal.
In so many words, yes.
Listen...
Hey.
You should say so.
I don't wanna come along with you.
I'll be honest with you.
All right, fine.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
What happened to me? What happened to you?
You lost your control.
I lost control?
Yes, you lost your control.
Yeah.
Please...
...to me.
She came to talk to me...
That's right, yeah.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
I see you, you motherfuckers.
And at the...
Meet me at three.
What - what, Caesar's?
No, a...
...hundred yards further down the road.
Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
And what'd she want?
She was afraid to call you.
Sammy.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
It's me.
Nick?
No, I'm not okay.
How'd you know I was here?
She's there with you?  She's there with you?
I'll be right there.
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
Oh, thank you, sir.
You bet.
I'll come by.
Seven o'clock.
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
And they were usually right.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
You've got to stop her.
What can I do?
Half of everything is mine.
Ace, listen to me.
Half - I'm comin' down. 
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
Well, sir, I was just...
Why is she eight pounds over?
...position...
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
We can't get rid of him?
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
Why not make them happy?
Call security.
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
Here we go. Good luck.
What is it?
Oh, no.
He's gonna come up with ten thousand, just the way you wanted.
Right away. Okay?
I-I'll do it.
Okay. 
Ginger's mission in life was money.
I'll be right back.
See you, Ginger.
That was all bullshit. She just pocketed the cash.
Hey, Mitch.
...pit bosses, floor managers.
But mostly...
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
Understand?  I'm sorry.
Why're you crying?
I'm not crying. 
You're with me now.
Yeah.
Right?
Uh-huh.
You sure?
Oh, it's so soft.
It's nice isn't it?
Oh...
You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
What do you need?
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
Yeah.
Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
You can't make me stop caring...
What? What?!
No, you don't.
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
I gotta tell ya...
...under?
Pretty serious.
How serious?
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
It's under...
...twenty-five thousand?
Yeah.
And...
All right...
With what?
With the money.
He needed some clothes.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
He wanted a watch, too.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out.
You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now.
Let go of me! Let go of me!
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
Fuck you!
And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
You're not takin' Amy.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
I threw it away.
You threw it away?
Oh.  I got your cigarettes.
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
To the Riviera.
What'd you have?
I had a... salad.
What did Jennifer have?
She had the same.
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
Who were you with?
I was with somebody.
I mean, it could get us both killed.
I can back him off.
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
Listen to me.
Fuck you.
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
You understand? What? Let you go?
I want you to let me go.
I wouldn't do that...
Get up! Get going!  Get up!
You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!  Fuck you!
Just wait there for me!
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
Don't you threaten me!
I'm not -
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
Let me in the house! Fucker!
If she calms down...
They had all the pieces they needed.
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
...twenty years in order to find nothin' on me -
How many kids do you have?
Mr Rothstein.
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
This is not the way to treat people.
A record of the arrests...
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
No, Sir.
Well, I... I never tried.
Ye-yeah.
What?
Is this yours? Your pen?
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
Get out of here.
Thank you.
Yeah.
I didn't give 'em the m-
Yeah, thanks.
Shut your mouth!
You shut up.
What else? I gave her a schaff [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.]
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
I'll to the FBI!
He won't...
Please.
That's not a problem, that's not a p-
Can I go in?
Jeff, would you go in with her?
And here. Here.
Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca-
Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where you goin' -
It looked like a fuckin' gun!
Okay.
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy!
Yeah?
Here we go!
You've gotta be kidding me! 
I did - I didn't -
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
He tries to do everything...
Is that the last one?
Great!
We're waiting on Carmine.
Yeah, we're lookin' for Carmine.
He's gone?
He's not here?
Carmine's gone.
Uh-huh.
Calm down! Calm down!
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
Stay out of the way!
Artie! Artie!
But I'm just trying to leave.
How are you?
Fine, fine.
E mo va! [Italian-American slang for 'Now, go!']
It's in all the papers.
What're you gonna do?
And I mean... that's no good.
I know.
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
Okay.  Frankie, you're a good boy.
Definitely the most important guy in this room.
That's enough now!
Fine.
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
Hi, how are you?
Okay, Sammy.
Am I right?
I can see that. Sure.
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
All right?
Yeah.
It's all right.
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
Nothin'.
Yeah.
Okay.
You know?
Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's probably got it there too.
Exactly.
Yes, you did.
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
Everything went to his head. 
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
Is that what you want?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. Uh-huh -
Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
You fucked with me for the last time!
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
Well, you might as well get somethin' out of it.
But I saw something...
Thank you. Very nice.
I told you I was hot tonight.
What's the matter?
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
Get lost?
Yes.
Yes.
Come on! 
Okay?
Yeah.
You are.
I love you.
Do you know that?
God... I wish you...
You do?
Okay, then.
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
You got money. That's a - That's a good look.
Right.
Here.
He called you right here.
I just talked to him.
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
'Go! Go! Go!'
She started it. She started the whole thing. I'm just standin' here.
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
You're driving me nuts!
Listen...
...they're in Penthouse K.
They check in alone?
They checked in alone.
Are they out now?
Yes, don't worry.
All right.
I think that's it.
Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?
All right.
Two?
You know why, right?
Why?
What a smart kid you are!  Okay, eat.
Hold it, hold it. Here.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
You jag-off.
Come here, come here.
Get up.
This peter's a motherfucker.
Every night, on the couch.
Yeah?
Hey. This is Shelly.
Stacy. 
This is Nick.
Pleasure.
...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs...
But he never talked.
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
They're havin' a good time too.
So are we.
Let's get out of here.
Go fuck yourself.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Yeah, what's to stop him?
Oh, he ain't nobody.
Dominick said they're in the motel?
Shh.  Hide her car in the back!
Take it easy!
I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here. You know that? Bad fuckin' spot.
No more! You see? Watch!
Fuck you, you motherfuck!
No, no, no, no!
Ch-Charlie M!
Charlie M?
Charlie M.
Hey.
How you doin'?
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
I'm positive.
Well, I'm a little confused here.
You're a little confused?
Yeah.
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
Oh, sorry -
What's the matter with you?
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
Since when do you talk like that?
I'm sorry.
All right, all right. But I - I -
You'll get a heart attack like that.
Having a good time?
Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings?
Crowd always buys it. What do we got?
Adonis, be polite. She's a friend.
Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
Guilty. I am.
I don't know. I can't remember.
You're probably right.
I'm sure.
Uh Brock, today you are without me...
I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
She has a real spirit.
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
I suppose she does.
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
Priceless...We have a showdown in this alley, right?
Wha-at?
Catwomen. Lots of them!
Well then, let's agree to disagree...Now how about a picture for my scrapbook?
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
Touchy. Look everybody, it's Casper, the friendly crimefighter...
"Well done," Cactus.
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
What did you say?
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
Absolutely.
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
Now he'll be up all night...
I know.
You think so?...Selina?
Spear.
And I...I..want you to know our secrets..
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
What's the name of your child's best friend?
Ask me another one--
Enough.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
What did--?
You turned around!
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
What?
Nothing. How's your hand?
Uh-huh..
Yes, Mother. Dear.
Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
Trust me, you won't have to.
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
Thanks.
Any place.
This is one way.
I don't see anybody in there but you.
I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.
Do I hear a woman's voice?
I won't let him.  He belongs to me now.  Bye, sweetie.
That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
You could've made me lose my call.
You couldn't hurt me.  But it's the principle.
Theo wants to talk again.
Did you have to tell her my name?
You gotta just look the other way.
I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
You could've killed us.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!
Why would I do that?
I'm going to level with you officer.
Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
What else did you expect him to say?  Do it, Theo -- or give me the gun.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
You can tell she was really worried about me.
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
It's taken care of.
Will you relax?  This in no way affects our business.  Go on.
That's what I deserve for listening in the first place.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
If you know that just back off.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
And stop with the directions.
Make a "U" and go back.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
Satisfied, Wiseass?
What do you keep making me out to be?
I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
What am I supposed to do?
There's a taxi stand here.  I can meet you.
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
They're holding my husband downstairs.
You're the one who's not to be believed.
I don't want to know --
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
Oh won't I?
Because you know you'll be killing us.
Don't lay this on me!
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
What makes you say that?
Listen, there's an overpass coming up.  I may lose you for a minute.
Shit!
Bottom line!  There's nothing I can do for you but tip the cops.
She would if she heard my voice on the phone.
What about the others?
Tell me what she looks like.
How much time do you have left on it?
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
Hey drop it, okay?
Sometimes I paint.
Our house always needs touching up.
They say my work is somewhat derivative.
Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
I'm about ten blocks from the school.
You're breaking up.  I can't hear you.  Theo?
I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.
I can hear you again, clearly.
No.
I've got to ask somebody.
She's gone --
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
What bank?
Black Mercedes, 600S.
Do you know what's in that box?
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
To hide it from the I.R.S.
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
What's going on?
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
No.
Did you hear that click?
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
Or somebody else there is listening in --
Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
Don't panic.  I might be wrong.  Hello?  I guess I was wrong.
Try what you did before.  It worked before.  I won't talk anymore.
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
What did you do?
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
Put the man back on.
She's next.  In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
Can you walk?
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
You're going to let them get away with this?
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
They put their hands all over me.
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
There isn't any such person.
Whose money is this?
Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
Damned if I know.
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
There was <u>no</u> cop involved.  Oh shit!  Fuck!
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
You knew about me.
L.A.P.D.
Shit.  You couldn't be in much worse shape.
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
What's that supposed to me?
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
259-7881.
Ask them.
Some people fall apart in a pinch. But you shine.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
You're the man with the gun.
Naturally.
Only one way to find out.
That's how it's going to be.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
Pull over!  Pull over someplace.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
I don't want it.
Who is this?
You mustn't hang up.
Didn't we play this scene before?
I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
You're up on your details, aren't you?
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
We don't see you.
I still don't see you.
And not a nickel.
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
I'm backing up.
Don't worry.
Put the girl on.
Call me "Nels."
I think I've already had a "quickie."  Thank you.
You couldn't be calling at a worse time, Nels.
What does it take to kill you?
I suppose you're in your taxi?
My compensation!  Somebody still owes me -- big time!
Five minutes.
Where do I turn?
We're gonna get there first.
How do you know?
I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
Stay put!  I know my way around.
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Seems not.
Mind if I have a look?
Tell the truth, I was going to take a much needed leak.
Let me talk to the lady again.
There's no lady here.
Government business?
Very official.  259-7881, if I recall.
I thought so.
From here on, I dish it out.
Is that good or bad?
So who's he?
Then why doesn't she?
Who knows the secrets of the human heart.
Whatever you say.
See what, Dil?
He gave me a look.
What you think?
Nice.
What would you call it?
Now, that was a look.
She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
What do you think his name is?
I've no thoughts on the subject.
Persistent.
Good thing in a man.
An excellent quality.
Maybe he wants something.
I would expect he does.
Hi.
No. Tell him to go fuck himself.
Saw it, Dil.
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
Fucking men, Col --
Did I?
You fucking did.
Who the fuck is he?
Jimmy.
It's him, isn't it?
Maybe.
Charming.
Please, Dil --
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Fuck off back to Essex!
Fucking mad!
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
Fuck off, Dave.
He wants to know do I mean that.
No, of course not, she's a lady.
She's not that either.
Consider it how you like. Just get that bloody tart out of here.
It's a simple question.
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
Your Pat just cost me two hundred quid.
Off his wages.
Bloody right I do...
In a way.
Who?
Guy I work with.
What's his name?
What's it to you?
Nothing.
Not English.
Scottish?
How'd you guess?
The accent, I suppose.
And what's it like?
Like treacle.
Who's she?
Don't know. Who is she?
He's Scottish, Col.
Jimmy?
Not me.
Hi. You forgot your bag.
They all get the wrong idea.
What was that all about?
He wants me to perform for him.
You know.
You on the game?
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
You can't leave me then, can you?
Half-five. At Millie's.
What look?
They're jealous.
Why?
I wonder.
How special?
You want one?
Jesus.
Yes, please.
What'll it be?
Whiskey.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Must be in love to manage that.
Doesn't know the meaning of the word.
Tried to. Sit down, will you?
How different?
Tell me about him.
No.
Shouldn't I go?
Yes.
Are you jealous of him?
Maybe.
That's good...
What do you think?
I think you do.
You say that like a gentleman.
Do I?
Didn't think I could.
A real gentleman...
I am.
Is this an obsession of yours?
He did sometimes.
Want to look after you.
Something I heard someone say once.
Yeah.
What is this?
I'm superstitious. Drink.
Aha.
Depends what it is.
I'm thinking of your man.
Why?
Told you, I'm superstitious.
No...
Tell him it hurt --
I have to talk to her, Col --
Where?
Sorry, darling.
Give it over, Dil --
Apologies, my sweet.
Never said a truer word.
Do you care, Jimmy?
Sure I do.
You mean that?
Yeah. I care, Dil.
Shut up.
Made me feel all funny inside.
I said stop it.
You think that's wise?
Nothing's wise.
I know that.
So I'm sorry.
Make it up to me, then.
Ask to meet me again.
Will you meet me again?
When?
Whenever. Tonight.
Know what, honey?
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.
So they do know.
All right, they do.
Sorry.
Kind of wish I didn't.
You can always pretend.
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
Are you pretending yet?
I'm working on it.
Stop it, Jimmy.
Sorry.
Please, Jimmy.
No. Can't pretend that much.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Should have stayed a girl.
Don't be cruel.
Only if you kiss me.
Delirious.
He'd bring me carnations.
Not at all, honey.
Don't.
Okay.
Why, honey --
Come on.
You gonna tell me why?
No.
You following me?
Why shouldn't I be jealous?
Yes.
You could say that.
And you're not going to tell me more?
I'm not sure.
You'd do anything for me?
Afraid so.
No. Sit down.
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
It's a secret.
And you wouldn't leave me?
No.
You promise?
I promise.
I'm sorry.
No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes...
What?
Sorry. What you doing?
For me.
For you...
Look on it like a honeymoon.
Told you to stay in the hotel!
Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me.
No! I'm going home...
No! Tell me everything, Jimmy.
Yes.
My pills...
What condition?
Only in times of extreme stress.
I will be.
Jimmy?
What?
Your soldier.
You knew my Jody?
Are you listening?
Did you hear me?
It was you...
No.
You tried.
Don't you want to kill me?
Got to be somewhere.
Try and go, then.
I like you, Dil --
Love me.
Yes.
Tell me you love me.
Whatever you say, Dil.
Then say it.
Love you, Dil.
Yeah.
I'd do anything for you, Dil.
Never.
It's my name, Dil --
What happened to Jimmy?
Tell me what she wore.
Can't remember...
Do I?
Yes. Now.
Not if you go.
Will I see you again?
You will, Dil
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
The Metro.
Meet Col --
Yes. Say hello to Col --
What's that supposed to mean?
Carnations.
You know her, Jimmy?
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
Absolutely. Long as she can keep it. Isn't that right, James...
That's wise, Tommy.
Need to go across the water.
Do you now.
Need to lose myself awhile.
Aha.
Do you want some food?
Horny bastard.
Did you give him it?
Fucking do. I had him all over me.
Someone's got to do it.
My pleasure.
Eddie and Tinker died.
I know.
Yes.
No, what is the thing?
You're never out, Fergus.
Och, you do, Fergie.
Of course. I forgot.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
You know what. Go.
Was I?
And what happens then?
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
You may be right.
Who's the old geezer?
Some judge...
I take pride in my work.
Do you want a cup of tea?
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
Why would you do that?
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
You sure?
It's your decision.
You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth shut. Go in and get some sleep.
I told him.
Are you all there?
And do you know why?
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
Would make me feel better about it.
You sure about that?
Who'd you think it was?
I thought it was Dave.
And who's Dave when he's at home?
He's at home.
Should blow you away, you know that?
I know that.
Fuck you, too --
And who is she?
Just a girl.
Good.
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Hope not.
Good. So what do you think?
Right.
Kind of suicide, isn't it?
Yeah.
Can't.
How is it a farce?
So, what do I look like?
Yeah. And the brown eyes.
My pleasure.
I can smell her perfume.
Can't we take it off?
Only joking.
Nope. Not handsome at all.
You trying to hurt my feelings?
No. It's the truth.
What is it now?
Kill me.
You want to bet?
I'm not a gambling man.
Not in your nature.
I'm talking about your people, not you.
What the fuck do you know about my people?
And you know the funny thing?
No, what's the funny thing?
I didn't even fancy her.
My inside pocket.
Don't you think of it, fucker.
Why not?
Absolutely not.
She your wife?
Suppose you could say that.
Don't I know it.
So what were you fucking around for, then?
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
She's a friend of mine
What the fuck were you doing here?
I got sent.
Can't. Once I signed up.
Why did you sign up?
Best game in the world.
Ever see hurling?
Never.
The fastest.
My pleasure, Jody
Hurry up, would you?
Give us a break.
I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you, Fergus.
Yeah?
Don't be so sure.
Jody's always right.
Having a pint in the Rock.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Oh, yeah.
I've often wondered how you do it.
Depends on what you believe in.
What do you believe in?
That you guys shouldn't be here.
It's as simple as that?
Yes.
Some kinds of women are...
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
You liked her?
Want you to do something, Fergus.
If they kill me --
Don't think that way.
I don't know her.
Take her picture. C'mere.
I'm sorry.
How can I?
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
A story.
Like the one about the frog?
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
When I was a child...
Yeah?
Tell me something, anything.
Me? No, I'm not good for much...
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
What you say, faster?
I said you bastard -- stop --
Got to catch me first --
What?
Hurling --
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
And you know what?
Tell me, Jody
Who gives a fuck.
You never know.
People. They could be looking.
Whatever you say, Jude...
It was fun while it lasted.
Nice lady.
You shut your face --
He's a good soldier, Jude.
He believes in the future --
Shut the fuck up, Jude.
That true, Fergus? You in love?
No, we are.
You're crazy --
Give me the fucking shooter!
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
I think that's what you ordered.
Oh!
What about it?
It's lovely.
I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
It's all right -- look.
Why do you think I brought you here?
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
Open up.
Where's that airlines bag?
Lord, you're stubborn.
I sure am. Get it.
Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
Yes, you told me.
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
I know, but this is all we've got left.
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
Tex? You mean he's here, too?
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
Don't be an idiot!
I'm through listening to you!
Then who did? You're the only one left.
No!
You lied to me so many times --
There's not a reason on earth why you should.
Here, give it to me.
What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
I heard you, I heard you.
Then say it.
Reggie -- listen to me --
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
Only we call them agents.
We? You mean you're --?
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
May I have a sandwich, please?
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Yes -- and tell me if you recognize anyone. Just a moment. Have a good look.
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
Oh, I see.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
But I don't have it.
I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.
Thanks very much.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Oh.
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
Describe him.
No, what?
You mean you've known about him all along? Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Can I at least keep the onion soup?
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
But no one actually saw him die.
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
Very good.
1944. The next face, please.
The last one, please.
Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
What's your first name today?
Brian.
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
Yes.
But you're -- divorced?
No.
Oh.
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
We wait -- with our mouths shut.
I said with the mouth shut.
Okay -- up there.
Open it.
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
Or you --  Or you --
I'll take that.
Reggie?
No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
Carson Dyle is dead.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
I met a man with sharp nails.
Come on -- I've got something that stings like crazy.
Would you like to see my passport?
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
Yes, but we're divorced.
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
There -- you're a new man.
There must be some way.
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Which one are you?
Whitefoot, of course.
Come here.
I'm not fifteen.
There, you said it.
Said what?
What are you doing?
Who told you to do that?
You did.
But I'm not through complaining yet.
I think I love you, Alex --
That sounds like their problem.
Tuesday.
I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
No.
Or Tex?
Maybe.
Why?
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
I'm sorry.
I'm scared.
No --
I don't think I know that one.
How often do you go through this little ritual?
I don't believe it.
Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
Why don't you shut up!
Well!
Are you going to listen?
Go on.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
The money is unimportant.
I'm afraid it is important.
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
In human life? In greed? In suffering?
Forty-five thousand.
That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
Why bother him?
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
The kid said --
What do you want?
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
Tell me what?
I'm very cold.
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
He didn't have one.
He was a wealthy man?
I don't know. I suppose so.
About how wealthy would you say?
I don't know.
Where did he keep his money?
I don't know.
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
I know.  I'm sorry.
It is all right.
I wish you wouldn't.
One more question. Is this your husband's passport?
And this?
And this? And this?
In Mr. Dyle's room?
No -- in my room.
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voil!
Voil what?
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
No, Jean-Louis.
Oh no! What man, Jean-Louis --  where?
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
I don't know -- how would I know?
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
Sorry. Which view would you like?
I'm Regina Lampert.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Yes.
Good for you.
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
No, you see, I don't really love him.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
Yes, but we're divorced.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
Is your husband with you?
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
How do you know?
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
Is there only one Charles Lampert?
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
We'll find you a hotel.
Don't you understand French?
I'm still having trouble with English.
The man and the woman are married --
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
You mean you and me?
No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
I wasn't --
What was it?
What your husband was mixed up in.
Where?
How about once more around the park?
Nothing. Good night.
Good night.
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him.
That's all.
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
I believe what he said.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
How do you know what they're doing?
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Good night.
Yes?
Wha -- what do you want?
No -- no, I'm don't.
a alors! From Charles?
Because I don't love him.
But that is no reason to get a divorce!
Don't you want me to stay?
I've never seen him before.
He must have known Charles pretty well.
How can you tell?
He's allergic to him.
The American Embassy.
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
What's he up to?
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
He took care of Charlie for us.
Who invited you?
We want that money -- now!
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?
Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
Not my imports.
Don't flatter yourself. You'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me Ben.
I get the imports.
Good.
Fine, just don't mention the carving This is going to be a tough enough day as it is.
So?
Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
Daddy you scared me!
You're grounded Friday night!
You said that two weeks ago.
Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
I will. Is that all?
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
How much further?
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
You are upset.
I'm not.
I thought you'd be pleased.
Are you sure?
She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.
It can't be.
Who is she Daddy?
What did you hear?
Run!
We're seeing all the signs in town.
She just turned off her light.
She's still a virgin.
Did you warn her?
This will relax her.
She's underage.
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
She's not here.
You know where I can find her?
She works at a church?
A bullet to the right cerebellum.
She was murdered?
I can.
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
Why?
Daddy....
Who's?
No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen.
What are you doing here?
What?
You gave me a 'D'.
I'm sure you should have failed.
I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
You know about that too?
Then you should go.
I really do. For your own safety.
He's a rapist. Like mine.
Who?
Mark Shale.
Why?
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
I was desperate. It was gross.
OK. increase the peace.
Ok.
I won't.
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Follow me.
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
Why?
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
I'm fine.
I heard you got attacked.
I did.
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
You know I want to go with you.
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
Yes!
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
I don't know. I kind of am.
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
I'm making you feel like meat?
That's not why we broke up.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
Sharon's far from a slut.
What?
Pretend we're just another couple.
Hi princess.
Mom?
Yes?
You can ask me anything.
Have you ever heard of someone named Lisa Sherman?
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
That's what he said.
Did he say anything else about her?
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
What?
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
Two men left town right after it happened.
You're not telling me something.
The principal?
Who was the fourth?
Are you Jody?
Kenny's aunt?
His mother's side.
His mother's an only child.
Just thinking about something.
What?
What?
I'm worried about someone.
Hi Sandy.
No, you keep one.
So are you.
You're the one who's hand is shaking.
Hide your laptop here.
You can't bring it.
I'm not leaving it here.
Told you to hide it.
But you don't really mean it.
Maybe you better just drive me home.
That wasn't me ...
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
I'm sorry, but you're not going to die a virgin Rod.
You're being unfair.
Unfair?!
Yes. Unfair to me.
ROD!
At least somebody likes this shit.

Andy.  Another fuckin'...
...moron.
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.

Would you hurry up, please?
Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.
What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
That dog ain't mean.

Come on, get in the truck.

Damn.
What the hell's goin' on?

 Excuse me...

Do you wanna give me a minute?
You'd better coast through...

Oh, man.

Am I missing somethin' here?
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
You stole this truck.
You stole this truck!
I did not steal this truck!
You stole this truck! That's...

I ain't playin' that.
 Shut up.
Hey.

Okay, okay! 


Shut up.

Doesn't work.

Doesn't...

Okay!  All right!
Okay.
 Nice job back there.

I was thankin' you, asshole!
Kiss my ass!

Hey, take a look at your situation and...
...-cho and a hijack-...
...-er!
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
And I'm a peaceful man, and...
...I believe in live and...
 Yeah...

I did not steal the truck.
Well, then, that means it's call...

Oh!

I made it!
 I made it.
What the fuck was that?!
Shit.  You gotta pass him. 
Gee, you think so?
Holy--!
 Okay.  That didn't work.
 Gee, you think so?

Ho, ho...
 Oh...
...ho!
 ...shit!

 
Hang on!
Hey!


 Shit. 
 Go on.
 Go, go.


No.  Shit.
 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
Oh, shit.  It's okay.  Okay.

 Aw, shit  


Okay.  All right.  Okay.

...you're dealin' with!
I'm a dangerous man!
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
...man!
He's crazy!
I'm crazy?
You're--?  What?!

...here!
Come on!
Oh, shit.

Okay.  Okay.


Oh, shit!
No!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!

 All right.  Hey.




Whoo-hoo-hoo!
What?
Worth a try.

You're fucked, man.
...stole the truck.
It won't even start half the time.
You know what I'm sayin'?
You know.
How wonderful for you.
Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.

Not completely, anyway.
I mean, if that gun was...
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
...-er.  It was your friend...
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...
...miles.

That is loud!  I'm 
 Whoo!
Yeah, baby!
Hey.   Mason.
Yeah.
...deal with this asshole.
Even though it is nice to see Andy...
 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
A-And you  owe me...
...man.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Bring him down!
You all right?


Are you all right?
No. 

Hey!
Huh?

We're gonna die!
Arlo, shut up.

We're gonna die!
Hey, hey, hey.


Reach into my pocket.

 Come on!
Oh.
 Okay.
Yeah.
 Okay.

Okay. 
 All right.  Okay.

Okay. 

Arlo!



Come on, come on!

Come here.
Go, go, go! 

...-natic.
...to him. 
What?
You got Elvis?!
Go!

Stop.

Okay.  Okay.
Forty-five seven!
Oh, shit.

We've got Elvis!

And Brynner's right on...

He's comin' up fast!
...here comes the...

Tunnel.
Whoo!
What do you think I'm doin'?!
What the--?
You've gotta be...
I'm gonna kill him.
 
 What's it say? 
Forty-nine point four.
 It says forty- nine.
What?
It's melting, man.



Come on.  Come on.
 
 
What?
It's working.



We got-...
...-ta get outta here!
 Vitelli! Vitelli!

...another way  outta here.    Hey.
Hold this. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Sorry.

Let's go!
They'll meet you at the top.
Okay.  Come on, big guy!
What'd you come back for?!
Why'd you stay behind?!



We're the shit.  Bigtime.
They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo. 
Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
Who drove the ice cream...
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Who had to put a gun to your head?
Who put the big hurt on...
...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
Hello.
You.
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
I think so too.
 Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...
That's bullshit.
Oh, oh!
I feel faint.
Ooh.
That's right.
Hey, be cool.
Be cool.  Be--
That was quick.
...about him.
I'll keep an eye out.
It's for you.
Oh, my God.
This country trained me to kill...
...without compunction.
Well, well, well.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
Three seconds.  One...

But...
Hey!

So...where's my truck?
I did what I could for you...
 ...to Fort McGruder in his truck. 
We do need your truck.
I had no idea how powerful it was.
 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
 ...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...

...-lem too?
He's the dude...
Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.
 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
We've got it...
...on ice!  We've got Elvis on ice!
Us.  Owe us. 
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
...including the permanently extreme.
I'd say we're about even.



Are you crazy?!  Take the boat?!

Any of them Richard Long?
And I changed the schedule.
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward.
...destroyer of worlds."
No!
No!
No, go--
You look good, Richard.
You look fit...healthy...
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
Grateful?
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
"Went away."  I like that.
Almost quaint.
So far, ye-yes.
Forget about him.
...happen if I drop this?
Brynner.
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
Good to see you again, Leo.
Pleasant surprise.
I can't say it's a surprise.
And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
And I don't like deviations from plans, Leo, as I'm sure you re-...
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
...-enworth.  I'll have no compunction at all about using this.
Hm.  The wind's northwest.  That oughta be...Seattle.

One of our units is pursuing a suspect up the thirty-...
Who's your suspect?
A man named Tim Ma-...

Run a check.  FBI, Interpol.
It could be a cover, I suppose.
Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
Hey, doc.  Might wanna...
...try this one out some-...
...-time. 
Excellent.

 No, that's not possible, Mason.  The trout... 
...is a perfect hunter.
He's brains without ambition...
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
...the master of his realm.
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
...and that power...
...without caution...
...fishin'.
Some people might.
Doc!
Shit!  Oh, shit. 

 No...
 ...or it'll ignite. 
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
Everything will die, Mason.

Doctor.

Well, your prediction was on the nose.
How much longer for the range and power projections?
We don't have an hour.  We're already supposed to be shut down.
What?
Yeah, yeah...

Where are you now...
...Mason?
I'm at mile marker...
God!  They're gonna seal it.
Yeah.
Okay, I'll have a chopper meet you at the top.

Nope.  Is there a prob-...

His name's Vitelli.  Talk to him.  He's right out-...
What happened to Colonel Brynner?
Just go check the temperature.
Don't move!

Yeah, I'm sure.

Can I check one of these volumes out?
Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.
A ruler?
I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
I think I gave it to her.
Tell me. What do the police say?
They're calling it an accident.
Who's the investigating officer?
Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.
Where from?
We worked in Chinatown together.
Would you call him a capable man?
Honest?
That's too bad.
Too bad?
Yes, his girlfriend.
Yeah.
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
When was the last time?
What about her?
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
Is she all right?
She's fine.
Where is she?
With her mother.
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
I have no idea. How much do you want?
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
Of course I do. Where are you?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
Just bring your checkbook.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
What's that, Curly?
I think I'll kill her.
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
Curly, where's your car?
Where's that?
Could you drive me somewhere?
Sure, as soon as we eat.
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
I'll just tell my wife.
Tell her later.
I'll throw that in too.
Curly, you know how long I been in business.
Thank you...
The apple core club.
The apple core?
How are you, Lou?
Yeah, they are.
How'd you get past the guards?
Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little.
I get by.
Since I made Lieutenant.
Who?
Oh yes.
I'd like to talk to him.
You're welcome to try. There he is.
Or her name?
No.
No?
No. It was an accident.
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
When I do, you'll hear about it.
Didn't you call?
How do you happen to know her?
Let me show you something.
How did she...  ...happen to have them?
C'mon I'll show you.
Too late for what?
They only dump the water at night.
Shut up.  Go on.
Where?
What for?
Tell us about it on the way to Pedro.
Yeah.
Well, let's go.
Do me a favor, will you, Lou?
I guess not.
Give you three minutes.
Gee, thanks, Lou.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
Yes.
Mr. Gittes.
Well yes.
What are you having?
Iced tea.
Yeah. Fine, thank you.
I said I'll drop it.
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
I don't want to drop it.
Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
Looks like you went quite a distance.
Please call first.
...Just a minute...
You left your keys in the ignition.
Oh... thank you.
Well, how much would you like?
My husband.
He told you?
Mr. Gittes.
Did he know?
Where you were when your husband died.
You mean you don't know where you were?
I mean I can't tell you.
You were seeing someone, too.
That your maiden name?
Yes... why?
No reason.
No. I'm just a snoop.
More like other people putting their business in my nose.
Another satisfied client's wife.
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
What for? There's nothing more to say.  Get my car, please.
Never forgave him for what?
Of course I'm sure.
What dam?
Know him?
What? What is it?
Get in the car.
Why?
I gave everybody the night off.
Easy, it's an innocent question.
No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
When was the last time?
Why?
What were you doing there?
Working for the District Attorney.
Doing what?
Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was...
...No. Why was it.
Your eye.
What about it?
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
...Yes, sort of a birthmark...
Just... I have to.
And I want to know where.
It has to do with my father.
He owns it. You know?
You saw my fa... father? When?
This morning.
You didn't tell me.
There hasn't been a lot of time.
That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
Including the death of your husband?
Then let's go talk to her.
What does it look like?
Aren't you coming back with me?
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
Sure.
Upstairs. Why?
I want to see her.
You know any good criminal lawyers?
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
What are you saying?
Katherine?... Katherine who?
She's my daughter.
She's my sister.
She's my sister and my daughter!
Back to Mexico.
I have to go home and get my things.
I'll take care of it.
Where can we go?
...where does Kyo live?
He didn't wear bifocals.
I'm all right.
Sure, but I'd like to handle it.
He's in the dark room.
Sophie.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
Isn't everybody? What can I do for you, Miss Sessions?
You'll find one of those people.
'Those people?' Miss Sessions.
A Miss Sessions calling.
Who?
Ida Sessions.
Don't know her. Take a number.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
There's just one question.
Of course.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
I wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?
He never even kids about it.
Maybe he takes it very seriously.
Well, tell him I'll be back.
I don't understand.
I said, the northwest valley.
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Yes?
Do you know me?
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Have we ever met?
Well, no.
Never?
Never.
Si.
What about the water?
When it comes.
When it comes? What'd you tell him?
That's a long fall.
So how are you, Morty?
Drowned, too.
Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
It's not completely dry.
Yeah.
Sure you do.
I'm afraid so.
I am sorry.
...Yes of course.
Then go home and forget about it.
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
He's not in, Mr.?
Gittes.
It's personal. Has he been out long?
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
He was expecting you?
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
Yes.
They were partners.
Yeah.
Let me explain something to you, Walsh. This business requires a certain finesse.
All she needed for that was the phone book!
When I find out who that phony bitch was.
They're all a bunch of phonies.
I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Mortgage Department, First National Bank.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
Well, you never know, do you?
That's for sure.
Why'd she run away?
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
It tastes wonderful!
Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!!  Good thing Germany's closer than Russia.
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
Progress! It always arrives too late!
That's right, Modern Times.
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
Is there a woman?...Tell me the truth...  There is a woman.
What's she like? What's she like?...
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
Don't think about it, Toto. Don't even try. With feelings, there's nothing to understand.
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
No. And nobody knows where she is.
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
Elena. My name's Elena.
Hi. Why are you running?
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
Bye-bye, Elena.  ...What an idiot! What an idiot! 'Nice day'! Christ!!
We'll talk about that later.
But...who...
For what?
That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
Then where's the money?
Somebody stole it.
How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
That's all there is.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
I can't take shorthand.
Get me a typewriter.  I'll finish the notice.
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
I'll write it myself.
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
You don't really think so?
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Yes, very!  Naturally.
Well, well - isn't that nice?
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
Sure, sure.
I'm going back there.
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
Charlie?!
That looks pretty nice.
Certainly not.
Certainly not.
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
Are they standing for me?
You've got a private office here, haven't you?
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
We've got a nice plant here.
Yes - Mr. Kane.
Is it good?
Yes, Mr. kane.
That's Leland, isn't it?
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Has he said when he'll finish?
We haven't heard from him.
He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
Emily -
Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
They won't hurt you, darling. Mother's with you!  Mother's looking after you!
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
No, it can't.  Good night, darling.
It may not be about anything at all.
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?
I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
Charlie, please don't -
What's the matter with you?
Toothache.
Hmm!
You're no Venus de Milo.
No.  They've passed on.
In the water.
I know...  But you do look so silly.
On the chiffonier.  Here.
Thanks.
A rooster?
I didn't say.
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
Is that what you want to do?
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing.
Half past eleven.
Half past eleven.
At night?
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
Don't tell me you're sorry.
I'm not sorry.
I'm going to leave you.
No, you're not.
Yes.
You can't stop me.
Don't go, Susan.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. 
Lock it - and keep it locked.
Yes, sir -
Mrs. Kane liked poetry -
Do you know what that is?
It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
I didn't used to be afraid of it.
It's been a tough day.
A wasted day.
Yes?
Yes?
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
What's wrong, Brad?
I'm drunk.
No, that won't help.  Besides, you never get drunk.  I wanted to talk about you and Emily.
She's going to leave you -
You might have made the whole thing less personal!
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
What check?
It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to -
It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
It's a letter from her lawyers.
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
Rawlston is my boss.
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
Was he in love?
Right here, Mrs. Kane.
How do you do, Charles?
Yes, sir.
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
Yes and no.
Well, thanks a lot.
We're leaving tonight.  As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -
The banks are out of luck, eh?
Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.
Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
You wouldn't want to hear a lot of what comes into my mind about myself and Mr. Charlie Kane.
I had a toothache.
What do you mean?
I'll have a highball.
I'm not from a newspaper exactly, I -
Are you sure?
Am I sure about what?
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
How long have you been smoking?
What is this, a poll?
What the hell is that?
You think I'm shitting you...
This? How long have you been smoking?
Do you mind if I drink this here?
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
Can I join in?
Exactly.
So where is he?
No, this is great.
Can I use the bathroom?
There's no light back there.
Why aren't there any lights?
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
Awww. That was so cute.
You two better quit it.
I feel nauseous.
Just now.
Dante. You've got a customer.
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
Train. It took eight hours.
I can't believe you're here.
Very dramatic, I thought.
It's not what you think.
Well... kind of, sort of?
Was I right?
I love a macho faade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
There's more, isn't there?
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
You don't have anything to do with it.
But can we date?
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
You're serious. You want to date again.
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
Let me take you out tonight.
You mean, on a date?
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
Sang.
He's not invited.
He's your fianc.
You're such an asshole.
I'm just kidding.
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
I'm easy, but I'm not that easy.  See you later, handsome.
Do you always talk weird after you violate women?
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
Was it you?
I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?
I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick!
Call the police.
Then who operated the store?
Nobody. It was closed.
With this guy locked in?
Pack of cigarettes.
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!
How 'bout covering point!? You suck!
I'll assess all I want!
Yes.
Hey, neither did ET; but that was a great movie, right?
What's your point?
Peptic ulcer.
Yeah.
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
What responsibility? You're closing the fucking store to play hockey.
Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major.
I thought Redding had like three balls!
Why are the shutters closed?
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
Bunch of savages in this town.
That's what I said.
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
What smells like shoe polish?
Go open the sore.
I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back.
No, thanks.
She called me.
Did you tell Veronica?
Eight and a half?
She called me Brad.
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
Great story, isn't it?
That girl was vile to you.
Allan Harris.
Chess team Allan Harris?!
I'm talking to myself here.
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
I think it's safe to say yes.
You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fianc.
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
Return of the Jedi.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
Blasphemy.
All right, Vader's boss...
The Emperor.
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
She's in here?
Each egg has to be perfect.
The quest isn't going well?
I told him that and he yelled at me.
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
The milkmaids.
The milkmaids?
Why not?
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
The best Burtless movie ever made.
Can you believe this?!
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
Why'd you apologize?
What?
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
I'm going to miss the game.
Because you buckled.
Sorry.
See? There you go again.
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
At least we're stuck here together.
You've got a customer.
Can we not talk about this?
I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
Then where're we gonna play?
"It's not like we're gonna sell out."
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
Julie Dwyer died.
Yeah, right.
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
I'm gonna go to her wake.
No, you're not.
Why not?
It's today.
What!?
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
She meant nothing to you!
I'm going with you.
I can't close the store.
Twenty-two; same as us.
An embolism in a pool.
An embarrassing way to die.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
Broke his neck.
That's embarrassing?
Bible truth.
Stop it.
I swear.
Oh, my god.
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
Balls resting on his lips.
He made it, hunhh?
Reach what?
You know.
What, your dick?
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
I don't want to talk to you.
Fine. Just lend me your car.
Why should I loan you my car?
I want to rent a movie.
You want to rent a movie.
You work in a video store!
May I be blunt with you?
If you must.
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
Please, get the hell out of here.
I know I'm your hero.
What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
I like to expand my horizons.
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
Five hundred dollars.
You're bullshitting.
I don't; you did.
Really?
Holy shit. That girl?
Because I'm here.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
You're happy?
I'm happy.
You're happy to get a fine?
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
Now I know you're lying.
I'm not. She just left.
What did she say?
I'm not.
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Watch the store while I go home and change.
What happened to title dictates behavior?
This is my way of spitting water at life.
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
Shut the fuck up!
What time did we go to the funeral?
This life?
Why do I have this life?
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
I should shit or get off the pot.
What are you talking about?
Leave her out of this.
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
Why do you say that?
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
What time did you get to work today?
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
It's not like I'm miles away.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
Got one. Just pulled up.
Same time. What about you?
To say the least.
I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Yes.
Just the paper.
Thirty-fire.
I know I can bench more than that!
I don't have love handles.
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
I'm her sister.
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
No fat, but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise.
How much can you bench?
I don't know.
Yeah.
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
To you?
I... I don't believe this...
'Bout the biggest pair you ever seen! NYNNE!!
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
What's that mean?
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
You used to go out with her?
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
You calling me a liar?
No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
I'm trying.
No, he got hit by a bus.
Oh... Can I help you?
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
I hate this fucking place.
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
You're kidding.
Bunch of savages in this town.
You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
What were you doing up so late?
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
She called you, didn't she?
Why do you say that?
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
Ooh! Can we?!
Really?
I was kidding.
Typically male point of view.
How do you figure?
Something wrong?
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
How many what?
How many girls have you slept with?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
You're a pig.
Why'd you hit me?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
Three?
Three including you.
I'm not the pig you are.
You!
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes.
He gets off on it.
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Why do you say that?
Like you said-she snowballed him.
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
I'm serious...
Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
You sucked his dick!
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
How many?
Dante...
Let it go...
HOW MANY?
Something like thirty-six.
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Lower your voice!
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
I'm going to class.
Thirty-seven?!  My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks!
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
I love you. Don't feel sick.
Goodbye, Dante.
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
And that made you feel better?
...it isn't there. Yes.
Thank you for the lasagne.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
It was only a few times...
Fuck you.
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
It stings a little.
Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about?
What's this?
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
You said you were here all day?
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
Scumbag. What are you doing?
Check this out, he's from Russia.
Swear.  Olaf, metal!
I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.
You gotta hear him sing.  Olaf, "Berserker!"
No way!
Feel that.
That's tight. Solid.
I like the way you think.
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
I beg your pardon!
Screw you!
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
You're gonna be at John K's party?
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
You're not?
I'm going to have a word with that asshole.
I know. I've been here since eleven.
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
Dental School.
Twenty bucks.
All right, asshole, you're on.
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
Bye. 
How yo doin', Gabe!
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
C'mon, man--it's perfect weather for a monster, full-fledged gutrush!
Exactly, cheesehead, exactly.
Nothing, just tourist souvenirs.
I copy.
Where's the radio?
So, what do you see?
Surprise me.
What usually eats a banana?
A monkey?
Y'know, Jessie, doesn't Frank look like a normal guy--but he's not,  are you Frank?
Love's a killer, isn't it?
You're getting warmer!
WHEN SHE'S SAFE!
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
We'll never know, will we?
Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
Give him the money.
Not on that leg.
Take the gun.
Hi, Gabe.
Is it really four thousand?
One...
Nice and easy...
Six...
Help me!  I don't want to die!
You're not gonna die.  Grab me with your other hand!
That's a virtue isn't it?
Just hangin' out.
I don't think you do.
I don't understand?
You couldn't.
Excuse me?
Why are you yelling?
Did I miss something?
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
Which could maybe what?
Maybe lead to a flare up...
A flare up...
Flare up of old emotions...
From one professional to another, of course.
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
And I can't leave.
You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
What are you doing here!?
Where's Hal, what's going on?
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
Making things real rough for Hal.
Of course I do.
It was great.
You attacked me.
Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
No, actually it was more like mutual attacking.
Yeah?
Sure, just give it back when you're done.
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
Want me to lead?
Cute.
Breathtaking.
No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
Up ahead.
Next time, date only basketball players.
Get it!
What?
This rope is sixty years old!
Never, what?!
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Helluva time for vanity!
Jess, c'mon...
Do it, goddammit!
I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
We don't have time to argue about it!
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
I won't do it.  No way.
Take the rope.
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
RUN, DAMMIT!!
And miss all of this peace and quiet?  Never, right Hal?
Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
Never could save a thing.
Now you get burned.
What the hell's going on?
Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower.  So far, no sign of anyone.  Looks like a phoney call. Over.
How far?
I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
Anyone else following?
Tucker and Walker.
Tucker and Walker, we've lost three bags.
It looks like a winding route.
There.  You blind?
Hold on, baby, he'll get you.
You're looking at him.
Where's the rest of the team?
Climb, Gabe, climb!
Then it's a deal.
Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
These are highly trained agents overreacting without just cause.
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
Why?  What are you going to do?!
The monitor! I never ask twice.
Ask the questions.
You're both with the mountain rescue team?
There, what's that place?
Kill him when he gets down.
We can't and he knows it.
What about it?
Then go fetch.
Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
No names, this is an open line!
Good morning, Walt.
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
I've been cured.
Good evening.
Great, sir. Great.
Try the wine!
No, my health doesn't allow it.
And you, sir?
My wife... Alex freezes.
No. She's dead!
Yes. They want to help.
Who are they, sir?
Julian. This will be these people now. Alex gets up.
How do you do, sir?
Hullo.
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
Well, shall we get down to it?
Yes, sir. Rubinstein takes out a notebook.
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
I did, sir.
The accidental killing of a person, sir.
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
No, sir, I feel really great.
Hi, hi, hi there, my little droogies.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
Fine, fine.
Well, how are you then?
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
Aye. Glad to see you back, lad.
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
What do I want?
You're gonna be sick are you?
You wanna be sick?
Let me get up.
Crime?
Murder, sir.
Do you mean Church of England?
Brown hair, is it?
Fair hair, sir.
Blue eyes?
Blue eyes, yes, sir.
No, sir.
Right. The mothballs, Mister.
Crabs?
No, sir.
Lice?
No, sir.
Through there for a bath.
Yes, sir.
Shut your bleedin' hole!!!
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
Fine... fine.
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
Vitamins will it be then?
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
Something like that.
You've heard Beethoven before?
Yes!!!
Fine. Fine.
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
I haven't seen you before.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
Just part of hospital routine.
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
I hope so. Is that the end then?
I was quite enjoying that.
Good. I'm glad
How many did I get right?
I'm sure it won't be long now.
Yes!!!
Father, I have tried, have I not?
You have, my son.
I've done my best, have I not?
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
Prison custody?
Have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness?
Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Carry on, Chief.
Sir.
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.
Are you feeling better?
Four in this block, sir.
Thank you.
Sixth is faster.
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
The ride is free.
You got a deal.
No.  You were right, I was wrong...  ...Max.
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
Travel...and things.
Yeah.
But not now?
Just had one.
Dozen times a day.
Max...
Max, the cab driver!
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
It doesn't matter!  Just get out of the goddamn building...
In my office?
Where are you, what floor?
Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
Yes!  Stay put, goddamn it!  Don't move from that spot...
Yes.
I'm...fine.  Fine.
You sure?  You look pretty shaky...
Right through those doors.  The man himself.
You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
Oh, my, yes.
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
'Fraid so.
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
Sorry?
Can't say that I do.
Federal?
Wouldn't dream of it.
Take him down.  Save Richard Yip, our witness...
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
I never bought that.
Oh?
Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
Not our call, Phil.
...if they're wrong?!
This isn't our goddamn game!
Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
What's your name?
Vincent...
Of course!
I've been calling and calling.
I got caught up at work.
You're gonna cheer up.
I'm standing right here.
Yesss, you are.  He's artistic.
Vincent.  It was nice to meet you. Visit again?
<u>My hands are taped to the fucking </u> <u>steering wheel!</u>
What happens if you don't?
Who the hell is this?
Tell it to Max.  Tell him he's an asshole.
Who is this?
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
Max!  Dammit!  <u>Answer!</u>
Oh.  Sorry.
Yeah, yeah, sorry...
You on some kind of work plan?
You mean like benefits?
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
It's not that kind of job.
You should start a union.
Why not?
None taken.  There are talkers and doers.  I like doers.
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
Max?  I'm Vincent.
You're cool.
No.  You say you're cool.
With what?
It's just a dead guy.  On three, ready?  Uno.  Dos.  Three.
Yeah.
It's a spasm!  Jesus, Max, don't be such a girl...
It's not me.
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
I tried it.
How about the thingy next to it?
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
What?
It's a mess.
So?
South Central.
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
You said you were visiting friends!
Yes.
Play music.
What'd he do to you?
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
How can you kill him like that?
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
How?
Believe it.
Good luck.  You think they got families?
I'll deal with it.  I will, I will...
Lenny, my dispatcher.
It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
I need the job.
No you don't.
Next time you pull any shit, I'm gonna kick your fat ass.
What?
Collateral damage.
I don't understand...
Yes, Max?
Am I collateral?
Jazz.  Music.
I listen to classical.
You mind?  I'm working here.
No.
What you mean, no?
I'm done.  Find another cab.
Leave me alone.
<u>I don't wanna know you!</u>
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
You go every night?
What difference does it make?
Oh, I'm captivated.
You'd do her a favor.
Jazz.
Don't start.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
Doesn't cover everything.
Good excuse.  How many others you got?
I don't get it.
No.  No way.  I can't do this.
In case he asks.
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
No.
Paid sick leave?
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
You do impress me, Max.  That you do.
Who?
Who's Heller?
No, not just that.
Yeah, that.
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
It's what I do for a living.
Head towards Union Station.
What's at Union Station?
There you go...!
What'd they do?
...indifferent.
As in...? 
Vincent?
Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
Let her go.
Who?
Excuse me?
Why the hell not?
I, uh, I have some problems.
The guy came right at us!
You turned up a one way street!
Drop me off here!
Look, I'm sorry --
Just drop me off.
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
Not for years.
Well, I -- Jerry, the point.  Get there.  What does it have to do with the President?
I can't promise you anything.
You think I'm crazy.
I think you're different.
You bit someone's nose off?
You're the boss.  Just don't make me repeat myself.  I hate that.
You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
Switch the charts.
What?
Love.
Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
You saved my life.
<u>Heart attacks happen</u>.
Arf... You gotta help me.
I can't promise you anything.
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
Change lanes.  Then watch your rearview.
Yeah.
Six months.  Eleven days.
I have no idea.
Flesh wound.  No big deal.
This would be it?
Are these yours?
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
Who?
Never heard of him.
Getting rid of my hub!
Has this happened to you before?
Never, but I've been practicing.
Who are you, Jerry?
How is it possible?
That was him.
Is he dead?
Please put it down.
How'd he die?
He was murdered.
Where'd you get your subscribers?
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
Right here in Manhattan.
You will?
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
Thanks.
Not today.
This way.
Connecticut.
What's in Connecticut?
Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
Did you kill him?
Is that what they told you?
Did you kill my father?
I don't understand.
Where were you the day he died?
At a horse show.
Then tell me what happened.
Because he believed me.
You do?
I'm sorry.
Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
You saw me standing alone ...
Without a love of my own.
Where are you?
I can't promise you anything.
You think it's a conspiracy?
Now she tells me.
Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.
That's great.  Good for you.
You've never seen her run.
Then I can't be hurt anymore.
You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
I'm leaning toward no.
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
Excuse me?
You've asked me that one three times.
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
Excuse me?
The truth shall make you free.
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
A dog.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
You do recognize it then?
I don't understand.
I want this box rigged with a beacon!
Working.
Working.
Night after that?
Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
Agent Lowry?
I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
Wasn't my idea.
Jonas?
Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
Yeah, I do.
I want to believe you, too.
What do you mean?
You think we have time to fool around like this?  Come on.
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
That you come with me.
I don't think so.
What?
He died...  ... in 1972.
Yes, sir.
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
Dr. Arroway, let me first say --
It's a hoax.  I knew it!
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
Still settling in, really.  Where's Dr. Arroway?
No, thanks.
Oh?  How's he doing?
No doubt.
Ellie...
The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
Rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise.
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
You mean --
Ellie.
Do you have a minute -- ?
Actually I'm running late --
It'll just take a moment.
This... seemed best.
Right.  Well.
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
How soon will you be able to decode it?
Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
No primer.
How can that be?
VB10's an M dwarf; Signa Draconis... too old.
Put it on speakers.
I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always.
This is how you see the sky?
It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young.
It's a civilian facility.
You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
And a hundred mile airspace.
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
I can't move any smaller.
But what do I say?
Just be yourself, Captain.  Find out where he is.
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
Could we hear God?
Dad... But tell me, how did... I mean how can...?
That's my scientist.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Why did you contact us?
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
The librarian... or the library...?
Now... you go home.
No!  I mean... why so soon?
No.  Please.
Not if you think like a Vegan.
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.
The systems integration site.
Mmm.  Look closer.
Peter Valerian.
Yavol.
'... is indistinguishable from magic.'
What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
We could be together again --
-- I'm moving to Washington.
Greenbank?
I'm serious about this, Peter --
Peter.
You too.
It's really happening.
That you, Valerian?
Like it or not.
Like it.  Almost there.
I'm -- I'm fine.
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
How long was I gone?
Make that two.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
Spoken like a true believer.
Yes.  Very much.
Prove it.
Some of my best friends are scientists.
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
I don't think so.
Why?
What are you so afraid of, Ellie?
The final countdown.
Oh.  I brought you something.
I'm sorry.
What is it?
I'm sorry -- I can't --
What?
I can't do this --
What are you so afraid of?
-- I don't know --
Hi.
It was quite a page turner.
I'm not sure it's come to that.
They don't believe me.
I do.
What is it?
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
But I made this arrangement --
Cut that backsass!
It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything about seats. We --
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
What are you doin' here?
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
What went wrong?
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
No.
That's good: he earned it.
Laugh it up, kid. You'll make out.
He's probably a gigolo.
Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
I don't know, Boss.
You don't know!
I... I... I...
Git to work!
Yes, Boss. I got it right.
Yes sir, Boss Paul!
Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
Borrowin'.
I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
I call.
'Bout two hours left.
What happened? How far did you get?
Shut up. Let him eat. Don't pay them no mind, boy.
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.
Get away!
What for?
He's gonna be awright.
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Well, whatta we got here?
A Lucas Jackson.
I just always did like truck rides.
Back at it in the mornin'. Just need a little nap...
I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
Long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
Stop beatin', man. You ain't doin' nobody no good.
That's what you're gonna have to do.
Cool Hand Luke.
That's it. That's the end.
Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
Oh, that's mah darlin' Luke. Grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator.
Take it easy, Drag.
Luke. Where you goin?
On my own.
Thass right. Just play it...
Maybe we oughta call you No-Ears. You don't listen much, do you, boy?
You just said he could eat anything.
You ever eat fifty eggs?
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
You ever see mah boy throw up? Shut your mouth and put up your money!
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
That fool. That damn fool.
Oh mah baby Luke.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Bet! Babalugats, bet here!
Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
Gettin' up, Carr.
Call.
I know he's got a paira kings. He don't have to stick 'em in my ear.
All the bears gonna be walking today.
Damn.
Kick a buck.
A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?
This is a big day for the guards. They get to remind us who's boss.
What are you talking about?
Give in? That's our Luke out there.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
Only kidding!
What did I do?
A little homeopathic cure for the willies.
He whispered, but it was <u>him</u>!  I know it was him!
When was the last time you washed your hair?
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  And guess what else?
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.
You <u>slut</u>!  No sexy young cop for you unless you shampoo your hair.
Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out.
But </u>alive</u>!
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
The same as the first time...
He told me he had done two others just like it.
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
She's supposed to have it.
She don't want it.
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm in charge here.
That's an opinion, not evidence...
Who?
Because of your phone calls.
What calls?  I haven't made any calls.
Would you want to work with us on this?
For months... last October.
He felt remorse.  He covered her.
How did you know they were stockings?
It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
I want a guard on you.  I'm worried about leaving you alone.
That's no surprise.
But it's a different m.o.
Then what do you need me for?
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
They weren't going to show it to me?!  The arrogance!  It's my <u>life</u>!
Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
In the sixties.  He's dead -- stabbed to death in prison.
He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.
MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
Not yet.
No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe. I'll fix it...
I'll get a locksmith.
Yes.  I have to go...
She on the passenger side?
<u>What</u>?...
They all have one...
Go and look for a note.
Why don't you shoot off the lock?
I know, baby.  I know.
Who prescribes the brandy?
Lieutenant  Quinn.
Because it's your job, that's all.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...
Oh, I know.
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
You're shitting ion your career.  You outrank hi...
Yeah.  And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
Just horseshit luck.
Don't ever forget how good you are.
Classy madonna.
Honest to God, Ruben!
I like women like that!
Why would he send this to Helen Hudson...
My promise.
Needle marks, fresh, here.  look at this...
Spread out like she was sexually assaulted here.
Look at him, grandstanding...
The woman's unstable.  You could wind up with a harassment charge. <u>Anything</u>.  You're like some horny little teenager.
I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day.
Shut up.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
Would you step outside, Sergeant?
That's always your privilege, sir.
Yessir.
Because I think I'm wrong.
How'd you get in on the deal?
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
Nikko?
You know I don't like to watch talk shows by myself.  Where're you?
That's what I don't know.  Why would you lie?  That's the problem... I can't understand why anyone would lie.
We were interrupted. I had to go back to the set...
Thank you.
He was a chemical engineer with a food company.
Outside in the visitors, car park.
What!? They brought the car here?
It is?
No, I couldn't. I feel too close to her.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
Do you find him attractive?
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
Have you seen his penis?
My last lesson's next week.  James... my car...
One of my suitors.
I'd like to go back. James...
Not yet. It's only beginning.
They said it was here. They told me this morning.
Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
I work in the immigration department there.
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
I can drive.
Hard to say.
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
You could get your wish at any moment.
It's hospital policy...
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
Yeah, and a dimple.
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
Patient.
What?
I want to see my mother immediately.
We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
I miss Beast a lot, too.
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
There's nothing to tell.
Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
Yeah, it'll be fun.
She said she'd be here at 10.
I'd have to see it on.
But everything's OK?
What about the engagement party?
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
You look beautiful.
Really?
Truly.
What's the matter?
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
It'll be fine.
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
Oh, no, of course not.
I didn't say...
I ruined your wedding night.
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
But what am I going to do?
Will you get time off to do that?
Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
Come on.
Wow.   Congratulations.
You've only known Jake a few months.
Oh, Letty, what happened?
I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
Ruth's already taken him home.
Tomorrow?
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
When did you start smoking?
And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
It's good exercise, Mom.
A deal's a deal.
I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
Just remember that I love him.
There's a spider in my room.
Mottled really.   Green and red.
I understand you just got engaged. Maybe that's where we should start.
It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
I guess so. I think that's right.
I answered these questions last night.
It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
Terrific.
What if it's got a pattern?
That must be really difficult.
You took bets on my diagnosis?
It's no big deal.   We all compare.
Who do you think you are?
I'm not the one who's masquerading as a doctor. I'm not the one who's, who's...
Anything interesting.
I've already checked it out 17 times.
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
Very romantic setting.
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
Enough with the abracadabra.
Guess.
The left one.
OK, OK, I'll give it back.
Good God.
A small price.
Exactly.
No rounds for another three hours.
Rendezvous at the closet in 30.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
A rose is a rose.
Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
Really?    Me too.
What's my rap?
What are the delusions like?
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
No way.
How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
I don't like lamb.
Lie down.
Your family just met me.
I do.
Michael, I...
But I do.     I love you, too.
Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
Home free.
So there were no problems?
Not a one.
And did you go to the mission?
So, it's over?
List schmist. You'll remember.
You like it?
Do you like it?
Really?
Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
It's sex time.
Shhhh.
I'll be forced to tickle you.
You, too. Kick ass today.
That's Mr. Beast to you.
Yeah.    How was the job search?
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
I think I should go home.
Are you OK?
Big restaurant interview tomorrow.
The restaurant, too?
I couldn't even face that one.
You don't have to take care of me, you know.
I got worried. Are you OK?
Congratulations.
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
It wasn't exactly a lie.
Always the drugs.
What?
We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad.
Michael, take it easy.
Silly, silly, silly.
I think I should call someone.
Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
I guess so.
It's hard to know where to start.
And all the plans we have.
Yeah, the plans.
I don't know. I don't fucking know.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
Oh, God, Michael, I know.  Why does everything have to be so hard?
What do you want to do?
I love you too, Letty.     I love you, too.
That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.
I will. And you make sure you take care of yourself.
You should go.
She's only known the guy a few months.
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
The receptionist said you called earlier about something.
Good going. I knew you could do it.
I don't feel like going to work today.
Won't it be hard for them to get a substitute this late?
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
No, it's not like that.
I'm going to the store.
I think you're overreacting.
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
Are you all right?
That's a big question.
I hope it wasn't something I did.
Something you did?
I think we need to talk about some things.
Especially this last year.
Especially now.
So, I've been thinking a lot...
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
So, what do you say, Let?
So will you?
Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
Who?
It doesn't matter who.
Have you been seeing another teacher?
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
I start on Monday.
I heard about your friend.
What?
I'm really sorry.
I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
I need someone to work on budget projections.
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
Simulated sapphires. I bet my daughter would love those, too.
That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do.
Do you know who this is?
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
You killed her!
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
You'll never get out of the city.
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
They left about a half hour ago.
Where did they go?
I dunno.
What?   This?
It's Elvis...
Who?
It's me...
Marcel?
Oui.
Should I call you back?
Oui.
It's Daniel.
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
I'm not here to negotiate.
Why are you here?
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Good word.
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
You want me to help you get out of the country?
And the other half?
I only have your word for that.
You have something for me?
What kind of business?
We can't.
She probably hid it at her place.    The six of us could find it in --
I'm not any closer than you are.
I'm just setting my boundaries.
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
Where are you from?
No one? Then why is Zero here?
And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
You want Zero to kill him?
What about the money?
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
You didn't buy batteries?
I thought they came with batteries.
I can't believe you didn't check.
I think he's already figured that out.
Everyone get some sleep.    We're leaving in the morning.
You're sure?
I just want to live long enough to get back to Paris. Just long enough to kill Bastaldi.
I'll be Elvis and you--
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
Has to be.
No?
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
What'd you get?
Some bread and...
You better.
I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
Guns.   Can you get them?
Man, I can get anything.
Don't bullshit me.
I ain't no rat.  You got money, right?
A thousand dollars?
Fine.
It's me.
Hector, don't interrupt me.
French guys?    You mean like from France?
What'd they take?
Everything?
Boy, you must be pissed.
Okay boss.
The Holiday Hotel.
Go look.
Go where?   The police are outside.
Oh, then we will have the house wine.
You can use my car.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
What is it you do, Sami?
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
Okay.    I will have a beer.
That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
I'm the driver.
Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
I'm not going to leave you.
We both know I'm already dead.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.
Yeah, I can see that.
I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
It's my idea.
Okay.   You can be Elvis.
No, that's not Mr. Taylor.
God, I want to go home.
Give it to me, Sami.
No!
Just tell me who's closer to the wall?
They sort of got away.
Yeah.   It's mine.
No.   It's mine.
Fuck me?   Fuck you!
Uh huh.
I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
You see that car?
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
No thank you.
I know where she went.
Feel free to correct him if you want.
Oh, you think?
What?
Where is it, Sophie?
Glenmorangie is very good.
And you don't speak French?
How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
You wanna tell him?
I don't know.
Tonight.
Take a nap.
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
Something like that.
Something like that.
You got it in a bar?
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
No.
Stick around and find out.
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy does.
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
A car.
I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
How's the arm?  Still sore?
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
I'll go and make up his room!
I didn't have the heart.
Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.
Wait!  I'm a friend!
Why were you spying on the Yus?
Then leave her to me.
What's it to you?
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
Real sharpness comes without effort.
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
And if I use them to kill you?
Tell me, who is your master?
Let's go!
You're already a thief.
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
Yes, you do!  You are still my disciple.
Long.
You don't seem to understand.
So what if I don't?
He is my defeated foe!
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
Do you know her?
Don't invite danger into your father's house.
Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
I have a guest.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
You're a sword fighter too?
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
How so?
I'm bored.
I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.
About you and Li Mu Bai?
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
I'll give them to you.
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Come and get it if you can.
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
Not another lecture!  On guard!
Let's end this here.
Only the sword will settle this.
What I've always wanted, to teach you.
Kneel!
Jen!
Give it back!
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
I don't take orders from anyone.
Give it back.
I am a man.  And now I've found the brightest star of all.
It is trouble for me.
Jen...
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Make a wish, Lo.
It has.  How's business?
Fine.
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
But something is going on at the Yu household.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
No, not yet...
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
Well, we had talked...
She needs direction... and training.
It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
I'll look around and catch up later.
Save your strength.
I heard Sir Te lost something.  And now Madame Te's not feeling well...
What does it say?
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
But the sword could be in his compound.
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
Who ever made that.
Care for a hot dog?
You buying?
I'm buying.
No onions?
They make you fart.
Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
Don't thank me.
Thanks, babe.
No further.  I'm serious.
You went out the window.  She was beaten and raped.  She died in the hospital.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus change...
My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
It's only a flesh wound.
It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.
How 'bout the morgue?
No.  I have one more thing to do.
The hell you say.  This isn't just about you any more.
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
It can't rain all the time.
It's just the dope, don't worry
Mister Funboy.
Mister Funboy lives there?
Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"  It used to be her favorite.
No.
I have to go.
A remembrance.  A closure.
In a better place.  I hope.
You're not gonna come back, are you?
You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
I went to see a friend of mine.
Well, how's your friend?
She's still dead.
Mom tried to cook.
Oh.
I'd like to get in touch with him.
Victims.  Aren't we all.
Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
Take the dope, too.
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
Wrong answer.
Another jolly nickname?
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
I know.  That is why I will prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?
Interested?  Follow the crow.
Miss her?
Leave me alone -- !
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
You work for the dead.  Forget that, and you can forget it all.
Maybe I was wrong about you.
Very well, it's your ass.
Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
18k.  Crap.
...necklace... pearls...
Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
Leather purse...
Is he inside?
Move in, guys.
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
I don't think so.
You might say that.
I'll be fine.
Excuse me?
You heard me.
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
You what?
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
On my mother's life.
Okay...
Got a boyfriend back home?
No.
Why not?
No.
I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
How do you know I've been with several women?
Great book.
You've read The Fountainhead?
That's a matter of opinion.
You need help.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
Give me the fucking letter.
Refreshing.
You implied it.
Because you act like a pig.
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
You don't find me cute? Come on, look at these muscles.
Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
It's my house.
No thank you.
How are you today?
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
That's none of your business.
How about tonight?
I'm busy.
Doing what?
That's also none of your business.
It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.
Okay?
What are you doing?
Reading.
Of Human Bondage.
Somerset Maugham.
You're not gonna start that again.
I'm doing some volunteer work.
Need any company?
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
What?
I do.
Lighten up.
No?
Not at all. Have a seat.
You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
Why are you doing this?
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
Why can't we be together?
Yes.
Where are you going?
Good for you.
Hi.
Hi.
Sure.
Yeah, me neither.
Why aren't you understanding?
I love you.
What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
Schwarz. Jewish?
German.
Doesn't ring a bell.
- none taken -
The football stud?
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
What do you mean?
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
Absolutely.
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
Those are my letters!
Do you want to learn or not?
Eyes closed.
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
Is it that obvious?
Well do you like him?
I don't know.
Did you hide the letters?
It's Kathryn.
Something awful happened last night.
What do you mean?!
I... I don't think you want to know.
Cecile, you have to tell me.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
Well what then?
Well did you like it?
I did?
Cecile, everybody does it. It's just that nobody talks about it.
That's one way of looking at it.
How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
But I thought high school is only four years.
It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
You think he'll like it?
He'll love it.
Just taking your photo.
I look terrible.
I want to go home.
I want to go home.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
Of course. I'm not a monster.
I swear.
Some other time, Cecile.
For the first time, yes. It'll pass.
No, you were fine.
I'm taking a shower.
Need any company?
No.
Want a blow job?
Good night Cecile.
Prude.
Don't you want to change that?
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
Yummy.
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Would you please leave.
Honey, is something wrong?
You don't know him. I'm so stupid.
Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
Baby?  Right on time.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
I swear on my life, I never said a word to her about you.
I'm pretty sure she did.
Pretty sure or sure sure?
She bought it.
I'll be in touch.
Who is this?
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
Where is she?!
Likewise I'm sure.
Ronald?
Yeah?
It's Kathryn.
No.
What do you mean?
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
I'll think about it...
Could you be more desperate to read it?
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
Because I'm the only person you can't control and it kills you.
Even there?
I'm working on it.
Loser.
Blow me.
Okay.
Shhh.
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
Oh sis. You're so tense.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Any day now.
Cecile.
Who are you spying on?
Take a look for yourself.
Yeah.
What's your problem?
Nothing.
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
Morning.
With who?
Exactly the opposite.
Kind of.
Oh yes.
It was... Fantastic.
Oh come on. For her first time?
I'm not in the mood.
And that's why you're leaving?
It clearly is why.
I want to fuck.
And I don't.
No, I'm not.
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
I've never done this before.
How have you dumped girls in the past?
Screening calls. Any suggestions?
I have a flair for drama.
You wanted an answer to your question.
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
Thank you. Now, where were we?
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
Will you calm down?
Fine! Get off me!
Didn't you hear what I said?
War it is.
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
Not at all. What's wrong?
It's Cecile.
What about her?
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
You will be discreet about this?
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
It's the least I can do.
Is that so?
I've already told you, she's not home.
Well please leave a message that I called.
I need to talk to Annette.
She's not here.
Do you know where she is?
She's out.
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
It's really important.
I understand. Good night.
I did?
We played backgammon?
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
Excuse me?
Oh... no thank you...
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
Did she show up?
Nope.
Don't worry about it.
She really loves me.
Can we do it later. I've had a really bad night and -
What are you talking about?
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
Did you hit her?
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
Don't know what I'm talking about? I know that you fucked Cecile.
You bastard!
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
But quite harmless, I'm sure.
No. I only let her go with Edward.  It's alright.
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
Did you ever make a wish?
Oh, lots of times.
Did your wishes ever come true?
At the old house with the voice.
On the back street  a green house
The Farren house
Do you know the people?
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
But it's already come true.
Sh! Then you must keep it true. Goodnight, darling.
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
What's her name?
Irena.
Irena.
I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
I know that.
Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
I forgot I had it on.
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
That's right.
What do you mean?
You're shouting at me.
I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
What?
It's your play.
Well, you know where it is.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
I live right here.
Maybe I'll drop in and see your Mommy.
Did you mail then?
Yes, I did.
I'll show you.
Certain wishes do.
It was on account of the birthday party.
Why didn't you run after them?
It's true.
It was just a voice.
This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
Yes, Amy?
She's there whenever I call her!
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
Don't you see her?...Right there, under the tree.
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
Yes, darling.
I don't know yet.
Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
You called me by my name.
Irena. But who are you?
I'm your friend.
I've wanted a friend.
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
But where do you come from?
I can not tell you.
Will you be friend for always?
For as long as you'll let me.
I shall want you for always.
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
But you must!
The numbers simply don't mean anything
My dolls. We can pretend.
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
Oh, thank you, Amy.
A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
It stands so still.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
Don't cry, Amy.
But she's dead!
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
But, Amy!  Amy...I'm dead.
But why?
That's a fine-looking ring.
A lady threw it to me.
But Mrs. Farren just started to tell me a story. Please.
But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
But what happened to the little deer?
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
But it was alive  it was fast and strong!
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
Why hasn't he got a head?
Don't you hear it?
Don't you read Shakespeare?
Yes, yes -
Anybody could know that song.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
It was pale...a shadowed gold.
Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
Good night...Barbara...
Now, I don't know Amy --
That's from her -- that woman.

Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
She pleaded so to do it
So do I, Mr. Reed.
Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
Can we get some service here?
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
Your lips look delicious.
I've been working out.
At Victoria's Secret.
I mean where on your body?
Oh, on my wrist.
No, it was another woman.
Good. Except for PMS.
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
How have you been feeling?
No it's mom.
Mom!
What does that have to do with me?
Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
Anything's better than Mark.
My shrink says he's not so bad.
Maybe he's just shy.
Only to see.
Can't you get contacts?
Try to get through dinner without them. You have beautiful eyes.
Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
Frida, grab that red one.
And she got the medium.
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
And he was ripped limb from limb?
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
Why would they exaggerate?
Did I kill him? Of course not!
No. I don't think so.
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
And my bra finally fits again.
Uh huh... good thing those cops didn't see that.
I wonder if he's married.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
What the hell is the tampon test?
I think he called you beautiful.
It is so hot in here.
No you don't, believe me.
No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him.
I put it down the garbage disposal.
And what makes you think you killed a man?
I haven't gotten it yet.
I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
Tuesday. Are you okay?
Shit, I guess I missed work.
Frida, Carlton's dead.
Oh no.
And he was missing an arm.
Okay, I gotta go.
Did you get rid of Mark?
Yeah, I guess. Mark?
Why not? There's been a murder.
You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
Why the fuck would you do that?
I could smell another woman on him.
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
No.
Ignore it.
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
So what do I do?
Fall in love.
I think I already have.
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
No. I won't let you do that.
About Mark? Carlton?
About Benito.
No, he's the guy I'm having an affair with.
Frida? You okay?
So you're Grant's secretary?
Starving.
That's great. Highly original.
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
They say sex is great for cramps.
Well I have it worse than cramps. Goodnight Gregory.
I really gotta pee.
You should have gone at the restaurant.
I didn't have to pee then.
My apartment's just such a mess.
Knock what off?
You don't have to pee.
So pee? Here?
Since when do you care?
You never say that.
Oh my god, I'm sorry!
I can't help it, it smells so good.
Frida, you know you're it for me.
Yeah right... You better go.
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
My bra is my biggest supporter.
Yeah?
On your desk.
Script coverage?
On your desk.
Coffee and...
Your desk.
Did you change your hair?
A little.
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
No?
Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
Are you following me?
At least let me give you this back. I washed it.
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
So what book did you buy?
Oh, it's nothing.
I can forgive you a bestseller.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
No, she died when I was twelve.
The weird thing is I've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
No. Nope, nothing in it.
A man killed in Central Park.
Uh... the buzzer's broken. I'll be down in a second.
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
What happened?
Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
I love you too.
They do? Oh no...
No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
Peter I love you too but...
I don't think you'll hurt me.
I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
I don't know. I don't remember doing it.
Oh my god, what happened?
No, I have a cat.
How big?
She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
Tell her I'm eating.
You can't believe this bullshit.
Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
We can just take this pillowcase.
He's been running money for the Mafia.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
I checked all the zoos. No missing animals. You think a pitbull?
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
And he was missing an arm.
We only live a few blocks apart.
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
This one walk you home too?
One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Thanks.  Just some pills.
Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?
Spinning backwards?
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
His wife.
Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
No one available.
How will we interrogate them?
Well, sir...  I don't know exactly.
He tried to kill me!
Shut up!  Everybody stay calm...
Just visiting my patient.
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
I'm afraid so.
Yes.  This way.
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
Ill be the judge of that.  Anything else?
Sorry, sir.
I didnt requisition a secretary.
The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
<u>Fine</u>?  Look here!
Im sorry...
Well be more careful, please.
Shut-up.
I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there.
Who?
Don't know that either.
Don't know much, do you?
What?
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
What?  Who has?
What is that door?
Which one?
No.  Have a look.
Yes.
Where does it lead?
But I...
I see.  The verdict, yes...
Wait, this isn't fair...
Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
You seem restless.
No.  I mean...  that isnt necessary.
Just let me sit here for a moment? Ill go soon, and stop bothering you.
Shut up!
Please...
You know something about me?
That's what people keep telling me.
Yes.
Tell me about them...
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
That's right.  I <u>am</u> your doctor.
Well...
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
Anything <u>but</u>, my friend.
No, it's the truth.
Nothing.  I don't know anything!
I'm...  being...  punished.
We are...  living in their dreams...
That's easy.  You...
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
Right.
What?
No more than the usual.
The usual...
You're kidding?
Don't worry.
Don't worry about it.
For a month.
A month.
Right and don't embellish.
I promise.  I won't.
Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?
I mean,  if it's a problem...
What the hell is this ?
No...
Great.
Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.
Yeah.
Fine...
Fine.
... What?
Just don't call him, Alan!
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
I don't give a shit.
Bob...
TilT we figure something out.
Bob, the guy had a stroke!
Soon.
Exactly. A condition.
Yes.
I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
Clean.
Check his kids.
We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
Oh.  Excuse me.
Remember that First Liberty stuff we almost got nailed on?
And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.
Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
I don't think so.
I'm going to kill him.
You can't kill a President.
He's only doing what you told him to.
I'll lock him away for good.
Just what you think I mean.
Are you threatening me?
Sort of... Yeah.
Dave -- I'm working.
I was gonna do something with Joan.
Oh. Okay.  I'll catch ya tomorrow then.
They could put you in jail.
Why would they do that.  They hired me.
This is undeclared income.
And who's gonna find out?
The government
I am the government.
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
Well -- take care.
Extend them.  C'mere for a second.
I'm afraid so.
Really?   Crazy?
In the car.
I see what you mean.
What?
Oh.
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
Fine.
What?
Quick.  Gimme a quarter.
We vetoed that?
Right.  We can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
Wrong...
Alan...
She knows.
Does it make the cars any better?
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
Fertility beads.
Ah.
What do you mean?
I just fired Bob Alexander.
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
Yeah.
Yeah... Sometimes they do.
You know.  Your first campaign.
No.
What?
We'd like to hire you.
Really?
Of course.
No.
But it's ten-thirty at night.
I had a feeling.
`Bleed for your king.'
What's that?
No... They don't kid.
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
Oh, sure.  Don't worry about it.
The Vice-President...
Well...
No thanks.  It's not that far.
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
You made their funding disappear!
Mind if I sit down?
You weren't in the state legislature.
Home.
You1re leaving, too?
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
It's just so strange...
What?
You have a lot of secrets.
I guess.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
I run a temp agency.
You find people jobs?
Yeah.  Is that funny?
Well don't get carried away -- I'm not that good at it.
It was inspirational.
Yeah... Bedtime.
I can't.
I know. I'm sorry...
What?
Hi.
Yeah, well... It's finally over.
I know.
I missed...
... Me, too.
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
Yeah... It could be fun.
Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel...
What about the intro?
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
Fabulous.
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.
The tunnel.
Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on.
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
MISS HENRIED, SHUT THE HELL UP!!!
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you.
What?
We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.
He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two crates. Can you get me into the hospital?
What?
I got some fuel comin' out and, I hope, some automatic rifles.
Come on!
You are dying, too.
PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.
God....damn you, Rhodes!
Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
Sir!
No, sir.
Let me see your weapon.
In the battle, sir.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
What'dya get?
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
We need fuel, and a couple automatics.
I'm alright. Let's go.
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
To fucking Mutt.
Don't come.
So don't goddam come!  Please.
I don't think they're in school.
They're townies?!
Knox Overstreet.
Yeah!  Tell him off!  It couldn't get any worse.
What is the Dead Poets Society?
Come on.  It'll help you get Chris.
Women swoon!
But why?
Yeah.
So?
I'll tell you later.
How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.
Except sex.
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
This is it.
Oh come on, Pitts...
I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
I couldn't stop myself.
Isn't he precious?
Doing fine, sir.
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
That's not my fault.
Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!
I'm in.
It's Nuwanda.
Nuwanda, what is going on?
Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
I'm one of the proofers.  I slipped the article in.
What happened?
Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda.
What good will that do?
It's better than doing nothing.
It's not all right.  Come on, Dad
It does?  What?
You know,
Stop what?
Chet...
Knox?!
Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
The pleasure is mine.
Ridgeway High.  How's Henley Hall, Gin?
Sort of.
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
You are?  She's glad I called!
But, Chris...
Huh?
You can't be in here.
Then come with me.
Knox, you are so infuriating!
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
What is that?
My Word
It's just for a little while. You promised.
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
Very good, Mr._?
Meeks.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
A barbaric yawp.
Yawp!
Again!  Louder!
YAWP!
LOUDER!
AHHHHHH!
Excellent!  Have him act.  Give it rhythm!
I have something.
Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
Not if you're going to stay true to yourself.
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
I don't know.
What I have to do.  Screw the annual.
She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry.  Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
I'm calling her!
Nothing.  No mention of it.
Then you can help him.
I'm sorry, Neil.
But father, it's not fair.
Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
But different.
Where is this cave he's talking about?
Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
Forget it, Pitts, you're coming.  Meeks, your grades hurting too?
What is it?
The god of the cave.
My brother went here.
Oh, so you're that Anderson.
I'll take him over mine.
What?
Nothing.
Thanks but  I'd better do history.
I... I just don't want to come.
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
I don't want to read.
What?
Found what?
A play, dummy.
They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
No?  What do you mean 'no'?
From my father and Nolan.
Neil, you're not gonna...
Quiet.  I have to think.
It's my birthday.
It is?  Happy Birthday.  You get anything?
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
Oh. 
I will be with thee straight.
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
Yea, art thou there?
Put more into it!
YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
Do you have to quit the play?
I don't know.
We have to make it to the third deck...
He's the owner...
Why don't you want a message sent?
Us...I'm talking about us... We're the fish.
And where is our point of arrival?
Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
Who asked any?
How soon can we get up and running?
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
You're going to have to get a new one.
Then you better start swimming.
Dead.
Shut up!
I told you...
With who?
That's where my boat's moored.
It ain't any better out there!
I saved your life is what I did!
The thieves.
I'm not a thief.
Then who are you?
I'm their ride.
What are you people talking about?
He's with them.
Jesus Christ lady...
What are those things?
I don't know...
You people...rich people...
I'm not rich people.
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
Thank you, I work at it...
Seen a lot of islands?
Quite a few.
Takes one to know one.
On the side!!
Right... You have a boat.
The "come back" kind.
How do you know that?
Takes one to know one.
You're saying they can think?
I'm saying they're calling the shots...
The quiet...
A meat locker.
We can't just leave them here.
You should talk...
What?
Yeah...
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
And what if I run into one of those things?
Soon as I get over the heart attack...
I don't take orders at all.
This time, make an exception.
He's not coming...
You ain't giving the orders here!
Forget them...
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
I'm flying blind here God damn it!
I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones...
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
I don't know...you got what we need?
That way.
Seafood salad.  You ever operate a jet ski?
How does an island sound to you?
One whistle... Start the engine...
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
Where is everybody?
Poolside?
Nowhere...
Like Mamooli's country...
Plans don't change...
Nothing.
Someone's back there.
Hey! Come out here!
Hey! You hear me? Come out!
I'm looking...
Shut up!
She fucked me.
She fucked me too.
Yeah.
Fucking women, man...
I know...
Those are mine!
You want 'em?
Damn right!
What?
Get the boots.
I mean let's get going before --
Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
John,we're going huntin'.
We're all going.
Nick's going?
Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
No women?
Hey! Fuckin' A!
I'll get it! Where is it?
It is too! Now you passed it!
Who's full of shit?
You're full of shit!
I'm telling you, they changed it!
They did not!
They did too!
Jesus, it's freezing!

Well... you remember Cynthia?
Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!
You don't!

Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
Couple of weeks... Listen --
Jesus!
Tell him, Vince.
You mean...?
Worse since she talked to who?
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
Sure. Why not.
Where? Where is he?
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
What hospital is he in? Where?
He doesn't want people bugging him, Nick!
But you must come in.
No, I --
But I insist.
I have to go.
You are frightened, no?
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
Where is he???
That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!
Thanks.
Oh. Fine.
Get anything?
Too bad.
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Now he's back.
Who's got the ammo?
Sit down. Here. Right here.  Albert! Vince!
Not so good.
No?
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
Kind of. You didn't know?
Sal's alive???
Nick, she won't say why.
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
Here.
You Biederman?
Biederman, yes.
Linda, what's the matter?
Oh... You know...
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
What?
Will you marry me?
Okay.
Would you?
I don't know! I don't know either!
I don't know.
Give her Miller's. Miller's High Life.
Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
Nick. It's okay... It's okay.  I have to go now.
Right here.
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
You're going hunting?
What?
I see you're going hunting.
I don't know.
Hey. Look. There must be something.
C'mon. I've got the car.
I... No. You do this for money?
We... Three bullets.
And then you...
Who the hell knows!
I want to go home, Merle.
Right here.
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
That way it sets.
Yeah.
Huh?
You do?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Fucking A.
What do you think about?
Yeah.  When it comes to hunting, that's true.
From Nam?
Pow.
Pow?
Oh.
Hell no!
Well, where's he from?
Yeah.
Promise! You gotta promise!
You got it.
It's ahead, Vince.
Huh?
Hunt with Vince?
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
What else?
I thought you might be praying.
I'm doing that too.
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
What do you think?
Okay, okay!  Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
What do you mean?
We what?
Three bullets -- minimum.
No way. No fucking way!
YOU'RE CRAZY!!!... NO WAY!... NOW YOU'RE CRAZY!!! YOU'RE COMPLETELY CRAZY!!!
Nick!... I thought you went home.
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?
You wanna bet?
How much? How much do you wanna bet?
Watch it, shithead!
Here! This is it!
No.
No!!!?
What do you mean, no???
That's it. No. No way.
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
There's Albert!  Hey, Albert!!!
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
You guys are crazy. You know that? I mean you guys are really nuts.
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
That's my plan.
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
What's that noise?
What?
What's that noise?
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
Great. Hey. That's great.
What?
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
We do, Sal. We do... You're the heart.
I know. It's like coming from the moon. Or Mars.
Yeah.
Did you get one?
No.
You didn't get a deer?
Here. Behind you.
Yeah.
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
Aw, it's a long story!
That's who.
What's it for??
No!
Never one.
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
Yeah.
The fuck I did!!!
The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!
Up ribbon!
Down ribbon!
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
I want this bastard brought down.
Wade's here.
Wade did a little reminiscing.
I'd think about it.
Avon Lady!
No, you're not model material.  Anything else?
Fuck you - fuck you.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
I want to see my wife and kid.
Later.  I want Doucet first.
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
Out of the room.
We have to talk.
What are you talking about?
He could be brought back.
Forget it.  Stick to the program.
I'm thrilled beyond belief.
What the hell are you talking about?
You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
How do I look?
Aces.
I got it.  I got it.
You sure?  I can help you.
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
Nobody's looking.
Ooops, I forgot.
Yes.
But Sergeant...
Commissioner Gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.
Technothugs.
How do you know?
Some things never change.
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
I'm not fond of television comedies.
My insurance won't cover it.
Pass.
Relax, let technology do the work.
I was set up.
Yeah.  Least I think so.  Twenty- six years this March.
Thanks.
I'll be okay.
Good night.
Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
Hey, I'm eating.
You want to be a good detective?
Then find me some cigarettes.
That cost me two weeks' pay.
No, sir.
Wallet, cash, I.D...
<u>Comwatch Dispatch System</u>.  Can't assimilate voice stress.  Code priority only.
How ya feeling?
How do I look?
Not too good.
We're partners, aren't we?
I'm here.
You treat her nice.
...What are you talking about...?
Not yet.
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
Hospital food.
You be careful.
I'm signing off.
No you don't.
And you should be with your family.
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
What's it mean?
You never want to find out.
Take a look at this.
But he was such a good cop.
They always are.
Yeah.
Seat's too high.
My mom says I'm gonna grow.
My granddad was a policeman.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
Good to know you, Willy.
Remember, get the seat fixed.
Hi.
This little thing says I can't.
You could always take it off.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.
From over the mountain --
No -- that's for me to do.
No, Jabez -- your place is with your wife --
Of course I will.
The -- folks or people, what's the difference among friends?
Thank you, Belle --
You're lying.
You know that you're in my house.
Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
All right, Daniel. Jump in.
It hasn't opened yet?
And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
And serve him right!
No! No! I won't.
That's just too bad --
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
No. She's gone.
Belle.
Belle --
-- in gold.
Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
Where's everybody?
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
You are afraid!
Afraid ... of what?
-- of what happens after we die!
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
Don't say that -- I know it is --
All right -- so it's buried with you!
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
I do -- and I think you should too.
Leave your tongue off of that!
I'm through with you.
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
Ten throws it is.
Well -- I'll be -- if it isn't little Mary Sampson from Franklin.
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Well, I --
Shall we?
Morning, Jabez.
Headache -- Squire?
Well? Don't a politician have to be?
Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
How much?
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
Coming.
Oh, Jabez.
Yep.
We can still use my butter money.
Your butter money?
Do you think I'm grudging it?
Mary -- it's gone.
If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
To save us work on the spring plowing?
Jabez ...
Mary -- how do you feel?
Mary -- what would you do?
Looks right elegant, Mary.
Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
Worried!
You'll never change -- will you?
Jabez --
Thanks, Mary.
Oh -- Jabez.
I'm serious.
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
And I don't want to have a washwoman for a wife.
Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son.
I am going to lock him up.
You're not supposed to punish my son, Mary.
It shows on your face.
What's the matter with 'em? Why don't they come?
Jabez!
Mary! Come back ...
Mary!
Hard luck -- like me.
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
All right, son -- if it helps.
I dunno.
Well ... make him keep quiet.
Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
What's that you say, Son?
I say -- it don't matter.
You'll be a father any minute now.
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
The law is the law. Good-bye, Mary.
And you didn't get it, hey? Come on, we'll have another talk with him.
Very well, folks. I accept.
Coming, Ma.
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --
Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us.
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
-- I'm going to try, Mr. Webster.
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
Hullooo!
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
Pretty good -- that's perfect!
Scratch will do for the evening. May I -- join you?
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
You can talk to me ...
I can't be honest with them.
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
So, you divorced of what?
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
So, why didn't you come?
Mind if I play some tunes?
That is Christmas music.
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
Not any more.
No, sir.
Tell me about it.
What does he want?
The guy upstairs who's fucking things up?  I can give him to you.
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
I don't want neutral...I want dead --
Who said we were terrorists?
Who are you, then?
Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?
Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?
New York...
Put it down now.
Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.
'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now you are fucked.
Then don't waste time talking to me.
Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
Gennero.  Miss Gennero.
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
Don't I always?
Holly Gennero?
I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks.
The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
I'm here, cowboy.
You don't want to know.
I...I shot a kid.
I still feel like shit.
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
What's it look like?  We're going in.
Yessir.
No.  I never smile any more.
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
Don't let 'em off the ground.
Yeah.
Come on, what's under this?
What about the kids?
Jackie - what are you talking about?
Well, how'll I get home?
Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
Oh, yeah, I will...
I love you.
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
Hello, Sonny.
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
Ooohh....
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
I'm really shakey.
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
Yeah.  So how are you?
That's it.
You're really crazy.
I know!
Where you gonna go?
I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped!
I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
I like that... yeah!
Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
I know I am.  I know!
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
Look... don't throw that on me.
Are they on the phone still?
Yeah... yeah!
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
Well, then...
It's my only chance!
Right.  See you sometime.
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
Who's this?
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
You alone, or you got confederates?
I'm not alone.
How many you got in there?
I got Sal.
Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?
What do you want to know that for?
Sonny-boy, one word?
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
Call me whatever you want.
You frisk me.
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
Come on.  I want you to see something.
Calm down... look at this, look at him...!
It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
What do you want?
The girl hostages.
Sonny, come on out!
They were ...
You tryin' to fuck me?
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need?  How else can we help you?
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
We're bringing in your wife...
He's all doped up.
I want to talk to him.
Why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street?
If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him!
Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
Come on, lemme load you up...
Gimme the keys to get outta here!
Give me the keys...
You're goin' outside with me.  If there's no cops around, we just split.  Otherwise, you go with us.
Mulvaney...
I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
If you take anybody, please take me.
You like me?
Sure - we like you.
Yeah.
Why not?
I don't think so.
Yeah?
Are you a lawyer?
No.  I had some legal training, but...
I want to dictate my will.  I need a notary?
What now, Sonny?
Yeah, just a cigarette got in a wastebasket.
Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.
I'm glad it's okay.
It's okay. [Regards to the family, Sam.]
Howard!
What about Howard?
I told you, he's got diabetes.
You were terrific, too!
Hey.  It's raining.
It was on the TV.
When was the last time you saw Sal?
No, not until after they killed him.
No, that's all.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
I used to, but I stopped.
You stopped?  Why?
Because I don't want cancer.
You shouldn't start now.
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
Yes...
Let's go, Sonny.
Yeah - it's all right... let's go.
Get 'em in the vault!
How'd that happen?
What?
... The bodies out the door.
I want him to think that.
But do you mean it?
But I want to know what you think.
We won't have to.
Dead or alive?
Alive.
All right ... send them the guard.
Does that still go?
We're not there yet.
Yeah ...
Everybody!  Back here!
Have him walk in backwards.
They gotta stop sayin' that.
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
Okay.
All right. 
Let's move it, goddamn it.
No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
Okay, when do I get them?
I want to talk to Leon.
I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.
It's my mother.  Who needs this shit?
What can he do, he's clean...
You follow my car. 
We'll have hamburgers on the plane. You ready?
Open this up!
I forgot she's in here.
Come on, nobody's going to the bathroom - come on...
Those bastards -- they poisoned the pizza!  Sal - you didn't eat any pizza!?
They're beautiful ...
Sonny - Here's your document.
Yeah - it looks real official.
Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
I said you were never a faggot.
What'll you do?  Come out.
Did Pop come down?
Doing what?
Robbing a bank.
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.
<i>$300,000.</i>
<i>Morning.</i>
<i>That's the crew. They follow us.</i>
<i>Are you all right?</i>
<i>The children like to urinate in the balls.</i>
Maybe you should fuck her mom then.
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
What do you think, dumbshit?
<i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
Yes.
Yes. <b> INT. KEG HOUSE -- CHAPTER ROOM -- NEXT </b>
I don't know. They might be dead already.
What!!?
What?
Yep.

PROVE IT!
Turn over your weapon, Edna!
Yeah. <b> INT. FENDER HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER </b>
Stop it.
Cunt.
I said stop it.
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
<i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser.
<i>It was the beginning of the end.</i>
Domino. Do you have a last name... Domino?
Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.
Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.
Oh my God... you mean... the two of you dated?!
You have sixty seconds... here's the question...  Which one of you is Frances?
There are no bond certificates.
What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?
No. What's the big deal?
Something is going down. Something bad.
He said... take his right arm.
SPEAK ENGLISH! JESUS CHRIST WE'RE ON TELEVISION HERE!
Do you know where Danang is?
Not really.
But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
We should sign her to a talent holding deal. <b> INT. KEG HOUSE -- FRANCES' ROOM -- NEXT
She went up to her room.
Real good.
I be.  I'm living large.
Is that the only tape you got?
I like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
I don't like anything else.
Yeah, I know dat motherfucker.
My brother.
My brother.
Yes?
I'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases.
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
Jade, I still love you.
Two dollars!  Forget it!
What did I tell ya 'bout dem pictures?
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
It's about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria.
What?
I'm cool.  I'm cool.
You the man.
No, you the man.
We're not hanging out.  I'm being escorted back to work.
I don't know how he does it.
I'm not stopping.  I'm on my way.
You're welcome.
Is it a good morning?
Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself killed last night.
I didn't.
Gotta go.

I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
You got a deal.
Do me a favor.  Go to work.
Later.  Gotta get paid.
I'm in here.
I'm working.
I just come home to take a quick shower.

Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
I'm coming.
I'm going with you.
Yo, I'm gone.
I'll see ya there.
See ya around.
What are you so worked up about?
Nice!
He's completely innocent.
Innocent!
I might be, but you're not welcome here.
...peanuts.
I truly hope so.  I'm tired of supporting a grown man.
How are you holding up in this weather?
Don't like 'em.  A fan will do.
Twenty "C" Duracells.
D, not C.
Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!
Motherfucker you.

Do I have to spell it out?
Can ya dig it?
It's dug.
What?
ML, hold this for me.
Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.
Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
Negroes kill me, always holdin' onto, talkin' 'bout their dicks.
Talk to your son.
I got no say over people.
Big deal?  If that's not LOVE, I don't know what is.
Can you pay me now?
Tonight, when we close.
Mookie, I don't know what you're talking about, plus I don't want to hear it.
No, just checking.
Where we goin'?
You don't know shit about shit.
You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.
You keep it.
You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
No.  What are you gonna do?
Make dat money.  Get paid.
C'mere, Doctor.
OK.  OK.
Tina, what do you want me to do?
Before I get off work.
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
Come in then.
Where's the ice cream?  The Hagen- Dazs butter pecan?
Your memory is really getting bad.
I just forgot.
I can run out and get it.
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
I can't be staying long anyway.
How long then?
Then we'll do something else.
What else?
Trust me.
It's 'pose to be cold.
Later for you.
Meda.  Meda.

To get my money.
Be a man.

Magic Johnson.

I'll be back after I make this delivery.
HATE!
I love you, my brother.
I ain't getting shit.
Sez me.
Forget it, Mookie.
I love you.
I'm listening.
Good.  I want you to listen.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.
You listening to me?
I know.
You really think so?
So what do you want me to do?
And that's exactly what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Vito, get a broom and sweep out front.
Here, take the broom.  The front needs sweeping.
Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
That's gonna be the last time you hit Vito.
Then we could try something else.
We don't know nuthin' else.
Tell Pino.
I'm gonna kill somebody today.
Whaddup?
Don't start on me today.
Good, make sure he don't jerk around.
Actually we have something for you.
Yeah, I think.
She's saying... a beautiful swan...
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
... flying gracefully... over the rice fields.
... to the tune of "Only the Lonely" by Roy Orbison.
Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.
You're the kid who was home schooled.
Yeah. How'd you know?
Heddo Jeth-ica.
Yes, you and the whole Special Needs class.
A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
Come over around seven.
O'clock?
Yeah...
Gotcha.
Would you like something to drink?
Yeah, but I'm buying.
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
Very good. Back in a jiff.
Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
Okay, what?
Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat!
Well la de da.
Famous? I've never heard of it.
I don't follow.
You know Mom, like in the pool.
Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
Is it okay if he spends the night?
LLOYD, did you ask your parents?
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
So boys, how was your first day?
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
Home school. Til today.
Home school? What's that?
I go to school where I live.
Is that what I think it is?
No, it's a treasure map.
Cool.
No no no no no.
Why not?
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
Shift to your left.
Wow.
The second R is silent.
Oh, of course.
You brave soldier.
Go fish.
Just a guy I hang out with.
Yeah, go-cart accident.
What?
She did not.
You take that back!
Shut Up! Buttlick!
Where did you learn that word?
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
Shut up Lloyd. You're not married yet.
Now you see why he was elected principal?
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
I didn't know that.
Welcome to public school, my friend.
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
Oh! Ho! Okay. You wanna go?
And my mouph is frozen.
Yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure.
Our own special bus.
How do you know it's for us?
Wanna bet?
Who's your partner?
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.
You can't marry my mom.
Just wanted to see how your doing.
I kinda screwed things up.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
I don't think so.
You're always your harshest critic.
Yes.
You have beautiful eyes.
Hey, where did you come from?
I bet you want your head scratched.
I bet you want your head scratched.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
So, have you given him "some" yet? 
HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible.
HARRY!
Go away, assface.
Captain Rob came back?
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
You wouldn't get it. Just a private joke between best friends.
Me, me, me!
The answer is George Jefferson.
A blimp.
A turd.
Who?
Hello, he only invented money!
What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".
Yeah, that's why I asked.
You certainly did.
I know I did.
Am not.
Are, too.
D2.
That must be her boyfriend's car.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
I lugged it all over town!
I made the polar bear pants.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
I... found that rock.
It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
I don't know who we are anymore.
Maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it. Put it on.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
Right. She's so proud of her boyfriend.
Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.
LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want.
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
Roger that, Wilco.
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
Well, that's too bad, this is his day.
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
I don't think that'll happen. We've learned a valuable lesson we won't ever forget.
Damn! What are the odds?
What?
That's the one I wanted.
Try one in a million!
Well, what should we do?
Hey, where'd you go?
I know.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
No.
Oh, you're good.
I wouldn't know. Being that I'm just the teacher and all.
Oh I think you do.
One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.
TURK, leave him alone.  You're coming too.
Special Needs class.
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
You're just jealous.
I'll talk to you later.
If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
Do you want me to pet your head?
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
Tomorrow night?
Oh, go on.
Me too. I'm almost there.
That's it. I'm done.
No, it was a complete waste of time.
Looks like the best man won.
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
Duh. I'm in your class at school.
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
You really are a pirate.
What are you talking about?
Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.
That's the downside. There is none.
Do we have a deal?
Uh-oh. Harry?
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
Hey can be on top?
Have you got what I want?
You know I do!
Oh yeah, give it to me.
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
Museum huh, haven't been there since my husband left me. I love art.
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
Uh, no and I don't appreciate...turn down here!
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
I don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. I've been through this a hundred times.
Yes you are. 
But we don't drink from the house do we.
And I you.
Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather.
Oh wow. Look at you.
And, take some more pictures.
Wow, you are smart.
And you are great in bed.
Who's there?
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
What?
It's a surprise.
Everything. Just for the record.
Just like the President.
The evidence of what?
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
Are you going to kill her?
Piter.
You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!
I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
This is my son, Paul.
They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
We are alone...
Yes?... How was your journey?
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
Sire!
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
Not sorry enough.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
No, but many consider my training valuable.
I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
Excellent!
 Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...
I can't... I can't.
Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
Yes...
No.
Always.
Why do they come?
Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
The most lethal poison in the Universe.
Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.
Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
Long live the fighters!
Pain.
SILENCE... SILENCE.
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
What is it?
They tried and died....  Jessica!
MOTHER! Tell me!
Did they try and fail?
They tried and died.
I'd know the difference.
My father sent you to test me. Music then?
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
We have our new army.  Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.
Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure.
It is my home.
Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
Huh?
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
Don't you bave a car?
Certainly.  But now the children of the night are calling me.
Do you want me to get it for you?
Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
Ah, so I pull the strings!
Huh?!  Oh yeah, of course.
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
Dracula?
I gotta type this up, while it's still fresh!
I didn't feel well...
Let me take you to the hospital.
No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
"Beg to differ.  This casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --"
So how'd we do?
We didn't make a dime.
Mmph?  Where am I?
You're shooting "Bride Of The Atom." Scene 85.
Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.
Yeah, I did.
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Don't let me slow you down.
Alright!  Let's put it on film. CAMERA!  SOUND!
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
I was thinking about killing myself.
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
Don't worry.  Everything's gonna be all right.
Eddie, how was I?
Perfect.
I know none of <u>my</u> wives would've.
No problem.  I know it by heart...
I don't know.  Where?
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
If you say so.
Rolling.
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
Sound!
What do you mean?
No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
Nothin'!  I told him he was great.
These shoes are itchy.
NO!  It has to be UNDERWATER!
Edward Wood, Sir.
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
H-how'd you know?!
I'm Criswell.  I know all.
I don't understand.
I made it up.  It's horseshit!
Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
My pleasure.  I'm always happy to assist in a little larceny.
We'll do our best.
What?
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.
Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
Close!  The <u>other</u> one!
I thought he was dead.
It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
This is my way of telling you --
Oh, just like in the script!
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
Say it a little louder.  I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer.
Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
Like <u>what</u>?!
The secretary.  Or the file clerk.
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
Does she have room for me?
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
Hey, <u>the movie's getting made</u>. That's the main thing.
Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.
Did you really mean those things you said..?
But you used to say --
I understand you just moved here?
Yes.  Hollywood is oh so exciting.
What other sixty-thousand?
Well, uh, if I could I would...
It's Wood.  Ed Wood.
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
I can't wait to take a look.  So what's up next?
<u>Dr. Acula</u>!
Lugosi's washed-up.  What else you got?
Hruphh...?
You could say that --
Absolutely!  You see this script..?
<u>Lugosi</u>??!  Didn't be pass on?
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
Yes?
Da pleasure be mine.
Oh, of course!
Tor!
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
I think you're quite handsome.
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
Nah, that doesn't matter!  It's a visual medium.
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
Bela, he talk.  Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk.
We're escaping!
Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
Isn't he dead?
Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
I got married last night.
Oh.  Congratulations.
The marriage already ended.
Oh.  My condolences.
Oh, hi.
You look beat.
I am.  How's your father?
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
I just picked them up on the way over...
They're very nice.  Let me get my coat.
No! I love sex with girls.
Oh.  Okay.
STOP!
Bela died.
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
The sun.
Who's Dr. Tom?
My chiropractor!
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
C'mon!  Let's just go.
Huh?!
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
Yes?
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
What's uncanny?
LOOK AT HIS SKULL!
You're <u>sure</u>???
YES!  JUST DO IT!
You know, to make the legs move --
Great!  Bring 'em in!  Bunny, I gotta run.
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
Are you IN5ANE?  <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
Isn't that the same thing?
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
What if I'm vomiting?
Do they show it?
No! Do they show you having sex?
Anything good?
Who?
They celebrated the common person.
Al!
Yes!
What?!
What?
So?
She doesn't give a shit about him.
You know what would be great?
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
You know it.
Good idea.  Could you all leave us alone for a few minutes?
Stand back -- I'm about to do my Happy Dance.
What if Shari's the dream?
Ed, do you want my advice?
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.

I ... don't know. I ...
Al!
We're falling behind.
Tell me.
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something?
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
What?
Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
So he killed himself.
Oh.
Yeah?
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
Send him away.
Hey, he cheated on her.
He made a mistake.
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
I mean, that worked out.
Oh my God!!
I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
Holy sh--
He says --
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
Could've been a nurse?
She had white shoes.
Mom?
I'm at the hospital.
What's the matter?!
St. Joseph's.
To you? In front of him?  With the...
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
Why? How...
But Al is your husband now!
Apparently, neither can Hank. What the hell did you do to him?
Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
No, I understand. That's - where is she, is she all right?
No.
What is she, at work?
She left.
What are you talking about?
She wouldn't tell me.
All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
Our what?
Our foibles, our foibles!
No, I mean...
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
You batted or you bunted?
Welcome to work, Ed.
So?
Dynamite is dangerous.
Okay ...
Yeah.
It's... okay
Well, when you put it that way.
Can't we just --
Go!
I missed you.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
What?
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
Shari, I really like you...
I really like you too...
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
So...?
Everybody hates me!
No. Who?
Look at this.
Really? 
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
Come on, let's go.
Where?
Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
Are you all right?
No. It's your fault.
Show business.
You're in show business?
Yeah. I service video equipment.
I'm making a tape.
We're excited.
Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom.
Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here?
Yeah?!
Yeah.
No. What happened?
Oh, Jesus.
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
"Quick pull off the highway" is not a relationship. Oh man, I gotta pee.
You watching the ballgame?
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
We'd better go...
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
You brought the cameras here!
You brought the girl!
Please!
Yeah.
Look, we gotta talk.
Save it.
Who's Shari?
Who's --
I love you! 1 want to marry you!
Hi.
No. Am I supposed to?
Check forging.
Oh, man! So...
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
The pirate ship.
No. Ray sat on it. I'11 see you.
What?... Why?
Hi.
Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
No.
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
Good?
Mm.
Ed?
Yeah. Why?
What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
By the X. That's were two lines cross -- forming an X.
pierdo.
Tu
pierdes.
El/ella -
pierde.
She's incredible.  Everything just gets soaked.
I'm not talking about ethics.  I'm talking about morals.
Everything's fine.  Just, you know, school.
He likes it.
Yeah, uh, just a minute
Do it!
You guys have fun?
What?
You're going to Catholic school next year.  You're going to Sacred Heart. Maybe they'll straighten you out!
All right.  I'll be back
Larry, we're not electing the fucking Pope here. Just tell me who won.
Yeah?
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
You know what they say about the early bird.
Thanks, Mr. M.
Ethics are...
Oh.  There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know.
Here they are.
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
NO, that's fine
You bet.
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.
Hello, Tracy.
I'm looking at new cars.
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Plenty of pep, too.
Uh-huh.
Yes?
Doing what?
I've got an idea.
My house.
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
I just have to get something. I'll be right back.
Take as much room as you want
I hope so
You will.
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Even tried you at home.  We've got a situation here.
Hmm?
Walt needs to see you.
Oh.  Okay.
Thanks. Well. I'm going home now.
Okay.  But is this about the posters?
Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
And when did you do it?
Exactly when?
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
And how did you get in the school?
Which door?
I have proof.
More this way.
Okay.  Give me the drill.
points at the motel.
Oh.
No, I... uh, didn't know that
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Still clear?
Yep.
We'll let it run awhile
Three twenty-five.
You're there.
Yeah.  I'm here.
Sherry... I love you.
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
A mistake?  That was no mistake.
I was lonely.  You took advantage
And she's super-nice
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
No, wait -- apples.  Apples.
If you say so.
I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
I'm not like you.
What?
People can see this.
So?
I don't care.
Well, I do.
Sorry.
It's a conflict of interest.  And Paul was first.
I mean at you.
It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
Oh, no, hey.  Like I said. Tammy wouldn't... she...
What do you mean?
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Hell, good luck!
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Sure, Tracy.
Thanks.  You too.  It was great working with you.
Don't you fucking knock?
Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
That obvious, huh?
It's practically stamped on your forehead.
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
How'd she meet Patchett?
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
It's Lynn.
You say 'fuck' a lot.
You fuck for money.
Do you enjoy it?
When they deserve it.
Did they deserve it today?
I'm not sure.
But you did it anyway.
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
Yeah.  But not for long.
How'd you get to know so much about him?
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
So tell me about it.
In the morning.
No.  Now.  You fucked him.
Call me Dudley.
Dudley, what do you want?
Doing what?  Mowing your fucking lawn?
Of course... But how?
How what, Wendell?
How'd you get them to retract?
You've got it, Wendell.
I got to write my report first.
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
Five minutes.  That's all.
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
Maybe.  I don't know.
Look at a picture for me.
No!  Please leave!
Yeah.  A great big one.
Officer White, put down that weapon and --
It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard.
She told you?
Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.
What?
Which one are you and which one am I?
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
What about him?
Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
I spent years trying not to live down to mine. 
I'm not asking you.
I don't know him.  Mr...
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
Against your code?
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
I ain't your <u>paesano</u>, you wop cocksucker.
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
Susan Lefferts.
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
What do you mean?
And I'll promote you.  You'll be a lieutenant immediately.
More or less.
Until he gunned down six people.
Nothing.
I don't have time.  I have --
Just show me where they are!
Say what and so what.
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
Dogs got no reason to live.
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
Man, what're you saying?
Ray, we got the shotguns.
I don't own no shotguns.
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
They shot him in his library.
It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
Trashcan Jack.  The Big V.  I can tell you he's on the Night Train to the big adios.
What does that have to do --
And what?
He runs call girls.  Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars.
I was thinking Detective Bureau.
Answer yes or no.
I... No.
So be it.
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
I'll break them, sir.
She may still be alive, whoever she is.
Anonymous.  Probably nothing.
Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
Something like that.
I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.
Not even with Exley?
That's right.
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
<u>Shit</u>.  Someone beat us here.
What?
Glasses.
Just don't shoot me.
Give me a minute, will ya?
Even I'm not that crazy.
You make a mistake?
Yeah.  My whole life.
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
It's a simple question.
I want to do it right.
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
What?
She <u>is</u> Lana Turner.
Great.  You get the girl, I get the coroner.
I get the idea.  You got a description?
Of his penis, sir?
Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
What's her name?
Lynn Bracken.
Why's she seeing Bud White?
Why do men and women usually see each other?
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
Why?
You sound like you mean it.
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
How about White?
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
You, me and White, huh?
Where is he?
Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
A sweet man.
Under the house.
I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
Sid, how are they hanging?
Down around my ankles.
You tight with the D.A., trash?
Around.
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
What's wrong, Trash?
What happened with the kid and Loew?
A bootleg...
Yeah.
It'll be our secret.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
Oh?  Anyplace else?
Working whores with squad two.
Oh Jesus.
<u>They</u> said he was behind an extortion scheme.
What'd he say to you?
Nothing.
What'd he give to you?
Nothing.
I'm telling you, I--
Nothing. Two nights later I was robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.
I don't know what that means.
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
Who else have you told?
When can you get it here?
I'm doing a transfer now.
I'll come straight there.
Be careful, Danny.
Rachel Banks?
A direct one.
I don't know who he is.
Yes.
Who was that other guy?
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
What do they have to do with this?
That's who they are.
The NSA?
You're crazy.
It's a SAT-tracker.
I don't know what that means.
I don't know what that--
No shit.
I'll pay you.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
What do you mean?
I mean did you call anyone.
Look, my wife is understandably--
Jesus!
I called my wife!
What'd I tell you?
I didn't use my name.
I called from a payphone!
What'd I tell you?
You told me no calls.
None of your business.
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
I was a traffic analyst.
How'd you get around the tap orders?
Looks like Detroit.
Welcome to Santa's Workshop.
It really is.  Did you find anything?
Yeah.  Take a walk with me.
The NSA killed him.
Jesus. Do you have proof?
They're here.
Who?
Them.
Where?
Here?
<u>Here</u>?!
They shouldn't have come without calling first.
You're driving.
Those are Feds.
Oh my God...
Fuckin-A.
Tell me about it.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Drive.
Goddammit--
Same thing?
So what do we do now?
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
What if <u>what</u>?
No.
Who?
No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert.
Is Jerry Delsano in?
My name's Neil. Maybe I can help you.
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Are you sure about this?
Hello. Hello, Maria.
You got any money?
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
I'm married.
That's fine.
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
Can you help me?
How 'bout Christian Dior?
Is that good?
I'll say.
What size?
Pardon?
What size?
Eight.  Size eight.
I'll be right back.
Thanks.
Remain calm.
Okay.
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
For that matter, I think you will too.
<u>What's</u> your point.
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
The robbery.
A police report.
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
About the accident.
What kind of trouble.
You tell me.
I can't.
I'm not his attorney.
Than why can't you tell me.
Because I don't know.
Somebody took my blender.
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
No.
Anything at all?
Not that I could see.
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
To buy lingerie.
For your wife?
I thought maybe it might be for Rachel Banks.
Listen to him.
You should take this seriously.
What?
I saw a man die.
What do you mean?
Yeah.
Who did you work with to get the--
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
Sorry.
It's okay.
He's got his priorities?
Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm <u>hearing</u> of--
It's not true.
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
Oh, please--
I think you should leave now, Robert.
Leave this house.
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
Was that doctored-up, too?
My father's put me in touch with an attorney. He'll be--
Yes.
Just reporters.
This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
Well...yeah.
Good.
Stacy--
That's okay.
The lingerie.
That was for Christmas.
I was missing you.
What is it?
Oh Christ.
Yeah.
That's gonna end tonight.
It's over.
Albert's gonna get me my job back.
I'm sorry about Rachel.
Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
It's a brand new card.
Maybe it's not connected yet.
Here, you can use this.
Sir?
My suitcase is gone.
It's not?
You don't know who the fuck--
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one.
I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
Oh.
It tastes like fish.
It is fish.
Not that much.
Brill.
Never.
What answer were you--
It's how he works.
Brill?
Yes.
So you've said.
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
Other than me.
Why would I--
How can I be sure.
I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
Eat your fish.
You got a minute?
I gotta go.
For the last four years.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
That's temporary.
Bullshit.
Rachel--
We're screwed.
I'm gonna fix it.
How?
Tell me about Brill.
I've never met him?
Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
What makes you think it's you?
It's not me?
You're a moron, you know that?
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
You're wrong.
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
We'd rather not--
Fuck you. You may have to what?
--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
We'd rather not--
Fuck you. You may have to--
Shut the fuck up.
My shoe?
Gimme the shoe.
You're Brill.
Brill.
Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
Where's Stacy?
What are you talking--
She can't talk to you right now.
Are those my Christmas presents?
Can I open 'em up?
Sure, go ahead.
Really?
In your dreams.
Dad!
You staying for dinner?
Where's mom?
She's in the kitchen.
Do I know you?
Where've you been?
I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.
No "900" numbers.
No.
Usually they take clothes.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
What about jewelry?
They didn't take the silverware?
No, but they took my blender.
They only took electrical appliances.
Serve the ball.
He's heard that it's escalated.
Into what?
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Christ!
Ssh!
Bobby--
They killed Rachel.
Rachel's dead?
Yes.
Jesus.
They're framing me.
Why would they--
I don't know. I mean--
Why would the NSA--
I don't know!
You're tired.
Jerry--
Listen to me.
You gotta--
Go to 'em, Jerry.
I have a family.
So do I!
No. No, it's okay.
Yeah?
Turn yourself in.
Jerry?
Yeah?
Go fuck yourself.
It's been a few years.
Yeah.
Tell me about it.
How can I reach you?
Are you okay?
Are you still in Crystal City?
Yeah, what's going on?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
Yes. But we can't.
Why not?
Then what's your goddam opinion?
It means who's side are you on?
I said fuck you.
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
What about the tapes?
We found the originals.
There was a transfer.
Am I to understand--
Get it.
Help from whom?  Christ.
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
Yes sir.
No sir.
Dean's with Lyle.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
So they know everything.
If they've looked at the video.
Oh, let's assume that they have.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
We don't know.
Explain that.
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
Federal Express?
How'd you get in the building?
The door was open, sir. I just need a signature.
He's carrying the damn <u>flag</u>.
Puffed cheese?
No thank you.
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
Then let's assume I don't.
Yes sir.
Hello!  Good morning.
Which stall?
Excuse me?
I don't want to go back.
I don't care to bargain.
That insults them.
Excuse me?
As the wife of one of our party.
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
Pardon?
You sing.  All the time.
I do not.
I'd like you to have them.
And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes.  Of course it would.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
See what's happening to them - the stars.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
Shall we be all right?
Yes.  Absolutely.
No, the marriage isn't a fiction.
No, but I think I do.
No.
Will you please come in?
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
Don't.
Good.
You sew very badly.
Now.
When were you least happy?
Now.
A lie.  What do you hate most?
Ownership.  Being owned.  When you leave, you should forget me.
What?  No!
This is empty, just coming!
It's a folk song.
Arabic?
You bastard, I was believing you!
I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
No.
I can't move.  I can't get out.
A surprise, he said.
We've got to get you out of here.
It hurts too much.
I know, darling, I'm sorry.
What?
Oh dear.
Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
I know.
Still a car.
You too.  Good luck!
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
What?
It's Geoffrey under this.
I haven't, no.  Sorry.
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
Almsy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
Her hands and feet were tied.
What did you do?
In my room.
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
May God make safety your companion.
Okay.
Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
No.
I don't know.
You are a Canadian spy working for the Allies.  Code-name Moose.
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
A nurse?  Well, sure, a nurse is great. A nurse?  Great.
Or was it Toronto?
Don't cut me.  Come on.
Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
Are you Hana?
What do you want?
Yeah, for a while.
So was my Patient.
Rabbit hunting.
I'll have some of your water.  It's hot.
Ask him.
What?  How could he have?  When?
I liberated it.
I think that's called looting.
I can get in the back.
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
Oh, all over.
Are you planning to be the exception?
I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
I don't know.  Paper.  Is it? Paper?  I don't remember.
For?
Top Hat.
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
The rest meant nothing to me.
Oh really?
Lady H said she thought you might be -
I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
Aren't you?
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
We can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap. Almsy smiles and walks on towards the others.
This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
I won't hear of it.  None of us will.
Very much so.  We are all, save my friend here.
Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
Candaulesyou're laughing at me.
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
Yes.  Dropping off.
How?  How can you see anything?
I can see my wife in that view.
Are you remembering more?
Could I have a cigarette?
Are you crazy?
He's Canadian.
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
Yes?
Thank you.  Thank you.
Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
Really?  That's sudden.
We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
I've been told that before.
Kip's another one.
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
- to her cooking.
You'd better be.
Would you like me to?
Never heard of it.
I don't think so.
Yes, for your hair.
You get Hardy.
I follow the wires.
I've done this.  I've had to do this.
Don't talk.  Check again.  Lie flat and then cut.
Yes.  Later.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
Nya-nya-nya!
Of course.  When?
I mean home.  India.
Kip I -
I'll always go back to that church.
So one day we'll meet.
When he dies I'll catch up.
And what if he really is a spy?
He can't even move.
No.  He's - no.
Oh God.  Oh God.
Hello miss.
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
Pardon me?
Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.
We can do that when we're very, very old.
A bit of one.
I was looking forward to this evening.
I had a hotel room.
Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops. 
Yessir.
Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
Why not?
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
What's he saying?
Or my wife's.
There are times when you don't answer the phone.
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
Bingo.
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
Yeah. Me.
Why didn't I think of that?
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
Which you have in mind.
We're getting close.
How close?
I don't know, but close.
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
Where are you at least?
I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.
I'm in the middle.
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
Who am I?
That is of no interest.
Uh. I'm showing off.
I can't?
It's sold.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
I have a proposal for you.
Uh, yes.
Meet me in front. Five minutes.
I'll call an ambulance.
You're joking.  You can't trust anyone these days.
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
I sincerely hope so.
Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously.
So alive.
No. Why would I be?
Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
Oh?
Possibly.
Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
Not a word.
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
That's my girl.
Give him the card.
But--
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
Not funny.
Got it.
We're only going one way.
I'm not the one to ask...
I never carry...baggage.
Certainly not mine. Come on.
I'm a thief. Sue me.
Where's my bag?
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
What's my problem? You want a list?
Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could.
<u>I'm</u> dressed.
Nice spot.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
That's when we'll do it. And we'll need every single day.
We're doing this together. We're partners.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
This isn't some Picasso print you steal out of a car dealer's rec room.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
No, dammit! I mean me! That Rembrandt...that Rembrandt!
That's because I wanted them to!
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
This isn't a good time to hear your personal philosophy.
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.
We are...for the tools.
Try laps. Say a hundred.
Our equipment has arrived.
Hmmm.
Yes you did.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
The lipstick thermal camera?
Charged?
One more item--not on the check list.
It's---beautiful.
Thank you.
It's not a village. There's nothing there.
I've got something for you.
Little celebration before we set off.
To our...partnership.
Terrified. Still am.
I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
Popup, on floorboards. And--
In eye of that painting.
It's a party.
Let's mingle a little, shall we?
You're not on the beat.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
Ready.
Got it.
Behind you.
Shut up.
The Mask.
Yes. Yes.
It's your mistake.
The big job.
There is no big job.
A billion dollars.
Get the hell in.
You don't know the half of it.
Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
It's fifty-fifty, less the cost of the dress.
Everything.
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?
My job, my rules.
You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
Right. The eight billion.
Where the money is.
It's no good without the argon gas.
You've thought of everything.
We're doing it tonight.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
Like a woman of mystery.
Charged.
Parachute.
Packed.
No. You'll see when we get inside.
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
There is one more thing.
Call it a new tradition.
It was wrong to deceive you.
But that's all behind us now.
Have really held you under?
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
Four billion dollars.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
That's because you grew up rich.
What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
They'll each be positive the other guy did it.  I fear an ugly international incident.
FUCKING THING!!!
We can't help it, we...we've gotta...
I sincerely hope not.
You can do it.
No way.
Go!
Get out of here!
No, you can't.
I'm not leaving without you.
Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.
You mean the seven billion.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
Always in a rush.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
The key to success is using the right tools.
It's never big enough.
Because I never assume anything.
This better be worth 1t.
It better be worth it for me.
How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
The early bird gets the damn worm.
But the second mouse gets the cheese.
Remind me why.
Because it pays off.
We're supposed to.
Suspicious, after all these years?
You change partners, you change the rules.
I'm terribly sorry old man.
Check out my ball.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
She's calling the shots now.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
To yourself, that's where.
She won't tell me everything. It's a bank job, that's all I know.
Thought you had to use some of these.
Yeah. Probably not.
That's a joke, right?
250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer.
What do you think?  What's this?
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
It's those files you asked for.
Who?
All of 'em?
All of them.
There's more than one?
Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
So you say.
Yes?
You're a lawyer?
Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it.
Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
Cause of the chromium.
The what?
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
A number for the whole group, or for us?
Any school you want.
And get someone to help around the house.
If you hadn't used profanity --
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
Out to lunch with the girls.
Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
Excuse me?
Lemme see it, will you?
A ten percent raise and benefits.  But that's it.  I'm drawing the line.
What, you think I'm made of money?
And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
That's crazy -- why not?
Bullshit.
Okay, fine.  I don't know shit about shit. But I know the difference --
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
Yeah, yeah.  Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy.
She lived on the plume.  You never know.
<u>No</u>.
No --
Show me the document that proves that.
Really?  It makes me sick.
I would now.
From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
What?  Who?
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
So what are you thinking?
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
Not in my world.
Gee, I wonder why.
Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.
Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
And, what, I'm not serious?
No one's taking anything --
Uh-huh.
And if you had to guess ...
Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.
This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
Erin --
Erin?  What are you --
Say you were wrong.
I was wrong.
How do you know that?
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
Here what comes?
The extortion, the threats ...
I wasn't gonna --
Take it.
Yesterday.
Good.
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
I guess I did.
Nope.  Maiden.
You're married.
There's more than one kind?
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
Hunh-uh.  What's that?
How come you're not eating?
Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.
I don't know.
George!
Some meeting.  With PG&E people.
PG& -- Are you sure?
In the conference --
We'll see.
Oh, God, sweetheart, no.  There's nothing on Earth I love more than you.  Nothing.  I promise.
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes.
Which number do you want, George?
You got more than one?
Return 'em.  Maybe you'll get your money back.
How?
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
Better safe than sorry.
Fixing a leak under your sink.
I'm gonna clean it up.
I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
Lock the door.
No, I wanna say hi.
Bull<u>shit</u>, Erin.  Bullshit.
About what?
What's that?
I need it.
I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
That's okay.  I understand.
I had photos of my kids, plus a mug --
I am not talking to you, bitch.
Have you been logging on?
What?
Yeah.  Who are you?
What?
Yes?
The Emperor?
Come in, Admiral.
Yes, Admiral .... soon.
Much anger in him, like in his father.
We've discussed this before.
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
No ... there is another.
You must.  Luke, look at me!
I'm cold ... so cold ...
Luke ... you are the only hope.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
What's wrong with him?
Barks an argument and shakes his head.
Barks and growls at his boss.
No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
What happened?
Howls.
Barks his agreement.
I'm looking for a great warrior.
Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
The temperature is dropping too fast.
You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
I have felt it.
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
He will join us or die, My Master.
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
Fine.  But they'll have to take care of themselves.
Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
Sit down, and shut up!
It can wait.
I'm going to see what it is.
Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
We?
Not you?
Sure ... If I were interested. But I don't think it'd be much fun.
No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
What was it?
Now don't panic.  We don't know that.
Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
I'll be surprised if we ever start moving.
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
Or you ran into something ....
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
How do I look?
Beautiful.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
Would you please stop calling me that?
Why?
I do not!
Where?
Outside, in the cave.
But the tremors have stopped.
The entrance is collapsing!
Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
Here ... near the Anoat system.
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
You look silly.
You look great.
Has Threepio turned up yet?
Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
... just remember that, cause I'll be back ...
That's two you owe me, junior.
Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
I always said you were a gentleman.
Don't ask me, but he's on his way.
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.
Not really.
We have no use for your kind.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
I didn't say anything?
What?
Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
Are the coordinates set?
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
Not yet.  They're working on it now.
We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
Closer?!
Oh my, no!
I thought you knew this person.
I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
Luke, no!  It's a trap.
I've never seen it fail.
You are reckless!
You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.
I thought I was in good shape.
That is why you fail.
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
Only what you take with you.
My mind fills with so many images.
It is the future you see.
If it must be.  Yes.
That won't be necessary.
It won't get through the blockade.
I want that ship.
My name is Lewis -- Lewis Dixon .
Believe what?
That primitive apes can talk.
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
And we can watch ...
A display of primitive apparatus --
Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
They look pretty docile.
Yes, but don't take any chances.
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
I'm a psychiatrist.
Please
I like you.
Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved.
I thought he was, but he came back.
What?
He's... near.
Cuervo, look out behind you!
I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
What's in it for me?
Don't lie to me.
All right, so I made another deal.
I got a new deal for you.
I see your point. What's the favor?
Say goodnight, Carjack.
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
I don't know yet.
If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
Somebody get off!
What's the little black box do?
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
You don't understand. It's already in you.
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
A medical team will be standing by.
No.
Good.
Lock fuel rods.
Locked.
Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
I'm here.
It's history. I gotta go.
So where's Plissken?
Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button.
No way.
I said pull over.
Right over there.
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right.
We'll see.
Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
Don't like it, don't come.
If he lets you get close enough.
Looking to get out.
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Down that way.
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
Who?
You need help.
Like hell I do.
I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
Sewers. Come on.
The freeway.
Find Cuervo Jones.
No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.
Who?
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
Well, I'll think it over.
Thank God.
Give me the prototype.
I'm looking for somebody.
Who ain't?
Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
Yeah.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
I will not.
But your life and lands are far from here.
I gave up my castles and my lands!
It is deep...
Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
Speak of the devil!...
But not from your destiny.
I want to thank you.
That's not why you came.
'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.
Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
In the great book.
What book is that?
The dragon! There...
...of course...
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...
Rise, Mordred.
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
Well hurry then, and get it.
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
You, my lord.
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
Who?!
You.
To me? But why?
Love demands it.
--Nothing!
He has given up.
You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
I will run.
Twenty days!? The world is that big?
It is.
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
Maybe... maybe...
Why?
I am the desert, where water disappears--
--I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
You didn't ask!
To kill and be king, is that all?
Well what's wrong?
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
Fuck it.
How about Lankaster Merrin.
No, he's working on another book.
Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
In here!
Hi, how'd your day go?
Oh great, anything else?
And you got an invitation.
What's this?
No kidding.
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
Why don't you let me?
Didn't who tell me?
Burke.
We have to start looking for a shrink.
I can't believe it.
What is it?
Phonograph.
Storage.
Me too.
Sure you won't change your mind?
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
May I ask...?
We still don't know.
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
Not that I know of.
Groceries maybe? A package?
Never mind.
Couldn't hurt. In the meantime...
What's her name?
You're a nice man.
Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
All right then we've got clean rats.
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
Karl!!
She is going to be well?
What!
A man to see you.
What man?
How are you today?
Fine thank you.
That's good.
Yes, I think so.
It affects concentration.
What is it? A tranquilizer?
A stimulant.
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
Are you sure?
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
Please go away.
I'm Father Karras.
Yeah, it would've helped. Have you gotta cigarette Father?
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
Pretty close?
Pretty close.
About my daughter?
No I didn't know you had one.
He didn't mention?
No.
He didn't mention her.
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
That depends.
On what?
The priest.
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Oh yeah, since when?
To begin with it could make things worse.
Oh, will you help her! Just help her!
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
No, is Regan aware of it?
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
It's not important good night.
What do you drink?
Are you sure?
It's fine really, sit.
In Europe.
Have you told him what's happening?
Well I think you should.
What?
Father?
No.
Um........Stuff.
What kind of stuff?
When can I have one?
We'll see Regan.  Now about those party invitations.......
You like it?
Oh it's so funny.
I found it.
Where?
The closet
Yeah.
You know how?
Here I'll show you.
No you don't. I do it all the time.
Oh yeah, well let's both play.
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
Captain Howdy.
Who's Captain Howdy?
He's nice.
Oh I bet he is.
Here I'll show you.
Cause I like it.
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
Well you know it's okay.
But you like him.
Oh you did. What did you hear?
I don't know, I just thought.
Well your thinking's not so good.
How do you know?
Why does God let us get tired?
God gets lonesome for us, Rags. He wants us back.
My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!!
Make it stop,it really hurts! Mother! Make it...
Hi Father.
Karras.
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
That's good.
Okay.
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
Where'd you get it then?
I stole it.
I believe you.
Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
Stealing is a sin.
You just missed them.
How's the girl?
Sure.
Withering Heights.
Who's in it?
Another one. Had your lunch?
No.
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
I'm not Regan.
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
In here. With us.
Intensely.
It would bring us together.
You and Regan?
You and us.
In time.
No now.
Quod nomen mihi est?
Bon Jour.
La plume de ma tante.
Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
Holy water.
Merrin! Merrin!
How's your leg?
Last month.
No momma.
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
In the face of the enemy.
And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her.
The Lord be with you.
And also with you.
O'Lord hear my preyer.
And let my cry come unto thee.
The Lord be with you.
And also with you.
Defender of the human race...
Her heart.
Can you give her something?
Don't listen.
What's this about?
From the psychiatric end.
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Yeah, a fall.
It's possible. Possible however
Unlikely.
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
Very much.
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
Alright. You know who I think really did it?
I could have you deported, you know that?
Are you tired?
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
...Be gone!!
Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!
...from this creature of God!!!
Yes?
Do you have an appointment?
Yes
Are you a relative?
Yes.
How old are you?
Twelve.
Is there someone inside you?
Sometimes.
I don't know.
Is it Captain Howdy?
I don't know.
Why not?
I'm afraid.
You're not going to drive.
Give me the keys!
You're not going to drive!
It's my goddamn car!
It's our goddamn car!
Give me the keys.
No.
Yeah, come on in.
Little slow tonight.
Mondays.
Your pay.
Take it now.
What about tomorrow?
We don't need you, Frankie.
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
Swimming trunks.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
Just the same.
Suit yourself.
You bring trunks, Jack?
Baker.
What's our friend's problem?
Teeth.
What's wrong with them?
They're falling out.
How many?
No bones.
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
No.
Two at a time?
My brother and I. One each.
What's wrong with the kid?
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
How's the birthday girl?
A little stiffer, but just as sturdy.
Twenty years, Ma ...
Recognize these two characters?
When they coming in?
Two nights.
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
Am I late?
That's not the point.
What's the point?
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Frank.
Jack.
Christ, will you look at your hair?
No one's gonna be looking at my hair.  Come on, we're on.
Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!
Like an angel.
Count it.
Jack...
Count the fucking money, Frank.
Fuck him.  Great.  Terrific.  Fuck him.
You're their uncle.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
It was an accident.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
Bosen black.  Flat.
What d'you say, Willie?  Tighten her up?
Yamaha white.  Nice.
Try the black Knable.
Thanks.
Really.  You sleeping?
Only on odd days.
Seeing anyone in particular?
Why the interest?
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
Funny.  Strike a bell?
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
It's more than that.
So do I.
We gotta go, Jack.
I don't gotta go.
You gotta go.
Says who?
Your older brother.
You'll see.
What do you mean?
Her hands.  Like that.
Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.
It's me.
Frank?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
It's not family.  It's business.
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
We don't get a gig.
What're you talking about?
Yeah, okay.
Your doorbell doesn't work.
What?
The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
Terrific.
You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
I don't know what you mean.
The hell you don't.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
No?
No.
What was it like?
Hey, you weren't there.  Right?
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
I'm not unhappy.
It never was.
What?
I just don't understand.  You would think someone ... anyone ...
Let's get it over with.
All right.  What's your name?
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
Okay?
It's early.
Come on, stand still.
Get out of here!
It's not gonna hurt you.
I'll hit you, Frank.  I swear.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
Here, how's this?
How about these?
Yeah.  Something.
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
You wanna get a drink?
Yeah, fine.
You recognized me.
Just a lucky guess.
So what do you think?
Very realistic.
First night?
Day.  Wednesday.
Last?
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.
Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
Unless you want the right.
No, you take the right.
Yeah.
All night?
Yeah.
Why would I mind?
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell us what he's trying to say.
What?
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
Fine.
Two hours ago!
Time flies, huh?
No. Why?
What?
We were just having a little discussion about morality.
Huh?
What are you talking about?
How come I didn't hear anything?
Celebrating.  Join me?
The party's over.
February?
April.
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
What?
What do you mean?
Just until we find another girl.
Cancel, Frank.
No.
Nothing. We get nothing.
I don't know. Some disease.
What disease?
I don't know.
You don't know?
Seventy-one
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
Shut up, Frank.
Who's weak now, big brother?
What're you doing?
No.
Good choice.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
I can keep the beat.
Yeah?
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
So what'd you think?
Thrilling.  Both of you.
The audience was a little off tonight.
No, we're not.  Jack?
Just call me a cab.
All right.
The flu.
So she's got a few sniffles.
Doctor's orders.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
What am I gonna do?  Put a record player out there?  Bad, Frankie.  Bad.
I'm sorry?
Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
It's one of Jack's favorites.
Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.
Well ... thanks.  Bye.
This is where the auditions were.
What do you mean?
We're finished.
What about me?
Punctuality.  First rule of show business.
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
How should I take it?
Impersonally.
So run a little longer.
Miss --
What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
That's the premise.
Uh ... we'll let you know.
When we know.
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
We're a team.  We work together.
So work with me, not against me. Okay?
What-?
We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.
Where's your dress?
What's he talking about?
That!  You can't wear that!
What's wrong with it?
It's orange!
Am I missing something?
Hey!
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Save it for your wife.
Nine?
Nine!
Big feet.
Zip me up?
Right.
They're nines.
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Oh, thanks.
Switch?  What fucking switch?
Did you hear it?
Hey!
For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Sorry.  It only plays static.
Baker's unabridged.
Virgins?
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
Jack?
It's paradise.  That's what it is. Paradise.
Great.
Great?
Yeah.
As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
Peggy Lee?
Tell her.
They must've bought the same map we did.
What do you say we send a bottle over?
I don't believe it.  You're a romantic, Frank.
Got another song for us?
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
Well then ... shall we?
Forget it.
What?
What're you talking about?  They love it.
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
Uh, well ...
Thanks, Lloyd.
Gotta go.
How come?
Job.
Funny job.
Will I see you again?
Baker.  Jack Baker.
Right.  Bring him back.
Come on, Ed.
Baker.
Right.  In there.
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
Yeah, well, couldn't I take a look now?
All right.  Hold on.
The name's Baker --
Save it.  What's he look like?
Black.  Labrador.
And you don't?
He leads, I follow.
Is that the way it is?
Pretty much.
It's been a long time, Ma.
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
His kid's sick.
Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
Nothing personal --
Aren't the kids asleep?
Every year.
So why's he do it?
I guess in case one year they're not.
Can't sleep?
In and out.
Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
Like a baby. You?
In and out.
No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
Hey, business is business.
Just dinner and dance, right?
Guess I got a little scattered.
It's a shitty  song.
Better than that.
Nothing.
Nothing.
You're upset.
I'm not upset.
All I said was you were good.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
What's that supposed to mean?
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
You were good.
How do you know?
Who's Nina?
Friend.
Ed? How many people live here?
Soap convention.
Soap?
Huh?
He called her.
Oh. So what's it doing here?
You sending me home?
So, what happened?
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Frank wasn't 'there.
Coffee?
Yeah... No.
Look, if you want to leave...
Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
There's always another girl.
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
We outgrew each other.
Yeah.
Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.
Huh?
Vegetables.
No.
Losing his teeth.
Another five years, huh?
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
He's got blood in his eye.
Eddie did.
Sounds big.  What's he do?
My days are not the old days, genius.
The recent past.
How do you know?
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
I guess it's getting serious.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Looks old.
Older than me.
Ever go to church?
Not so good.
Yeah?
Merry Christmas.
Good to see you, Ma.
Fine.  You?
Huh? Oh, no.
None?
I'm not much for sweets.
He's losing his teeth.
They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
You mean if I get sick?
He hit a guard.
Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
Yeah -- me.
Drive.
My place.
Should be.  It's yours.
Of course he is ...  -- He's yours too.
Shut up.
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
Like ...
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
Only one you've never broken.
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
For what?
For being one helluva guy.
"Thanks?"  I guess they really did fuck you up.
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
I'm late for surgery.
It's important.
Something good?
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
You want me to tell you it's okay to leave?  Okay, go on!  GO!
Don't hang up ...
Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
What more proof do you need?
Tell me what happened on April 9th -- 13 years ago.
Damn right.
Either way, come Saturday morning -- I'm pulling you the hell out of there.
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
And how much will your "fun" net you this time?
Not anymore.
It can't be.  It's impossible.
Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
Shoot him!
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
Or what?  You'll have me fired?
Trust me, he's already here. Get going!
I won't tell mom if you don't.
When did you start smoking?
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
Kim?
That's your name, isn't it?
You always call me Miss Brewster.
Get rid of them.
Castor's escaped!
Obviously someone else knows it!  Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW!
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
Yeah -- it's Santa's Magic fucking Village.  Your present's in here.
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
Like I fucking care?  I'm not just sitting here!
You've made us look pretty good in the past week.  And the way you handled the press --
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
What do you know about it?
As much as ever.  Nothing.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
You always say that -- then you leave.
Call me spontaneous.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Okay, if you insist. But -- you drive.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
-- Studying.
Wait a second -- you hated Madonna.  Didn't you?
Ooh, my suits are ready...
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?
Im sure you do...
What about me?
I dont think youre hearing me.
Is this another one of those Sun Tzu Art of War tricks?
Youre jumping, sweetheart...
Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
Im not worried, Mom. Hes still learning our ways...
I dont know...
Who did?
Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
On a case by case basis...
You know how to make chocolate milk?
I think I could figure it out.
Bye...
Big Eds.
Thats where you work.
Dont you think thats a little gimmicky?
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Ah. A classic...
Ringing my bell...
I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
Trouble at work?
I dont think so.
Its not Kate, is it?
She is relentless.
Pretty much.
So could you write down her exact address?
Screw the rules.  Im talking about the choice.
Its your birthday? Today?  Whats your name?  Where were you born?
Its me, Jack...
Yes...Jack Campbell...
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we couldve been really good friends...
What the hell are you talking about?  Whats he talking about?
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise itll be returned!
No.
Yes you do...
Damn, you are the real thing...
I call all you white guys "Jack."
Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
Me?
I've got everything I need.
Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
What the hell is happening to me?!
I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
Do I look like I live in a bottle?
What're you talkin' about?
Get out, I call 911.
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
Its lovely...
Need a nurse?
Youre a nurse?
Are we what, Jack?
Is there something going on between us?
It would help me if we were.
Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
Frank.  Wheres Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
Thank you.
Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...
Well, Im just a little confused right now about why I work here...
If youre into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
You want me to handle him?  I think Im ready...
Howd you do this year, Tony?
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
No, youre right.  What are we doing?
We're being responsible.  Go. Get on the plane.
You hear me complaining about that?
Yeah...fine.
I dont know!  Please stop yelling at me!
The city?  New York City?  Why?
Because thats where I live.
Jack...dont even start...
You look forward to this party all year.  Whats with you today?
Because youll be here.
Funny, Jack.  Im laughing on the inside.
Youre kidding me...
Shes your dog, Jack.
No, shes not.
...my feet are hurtin...
HEY!
And...?
Im working on a new deal now...
That is the general idea, yes...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
She got those shoes...
Sure.  I really like Annie.
Good, Jack.  Maybe well keep her.
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Whyd we ever leave?
If you want to look at it that way...
I want it...
Its good, right?
What...?
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Then say it...just say it to me...!
What? You make me hot...
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
But Im gettin close, right?
Now...I dont...
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
What are you sure about?
Ill just full yours up to the top.  Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
Way out...
Thats all I wanted to hear...
Its like a museum.
For the week?
A perk for what?
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
Youve been Jack Campbell.  And thats always a good thing...
Promise me again...
I promise. Come to bed, honey.
Its good to see you...
Dont worry about it, Jack...
Thats the one...
Not with what they pay me...
Youre not married, are you?
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Jesus, Jack...
Dont get on that plane!
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
I need you, tiger..
Where is he?
Not by a long shot.
Do I know you?
But youre not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
Youre a little tougher, Peter.
Thats easy. Youve seen my car.
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
Hey, are you okay?
No...Im not...
Is there anything I can do for you?
Last night was great...
I'd like that, too.
Tonight.
So we'll get egg nog.
I've got plenty of places to go.
Merry Christmas...
Hey, kind of giving up Christmas day for my ex-boss here.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
This ain't permanent.  My friend Reed's working on a cure...I think.
I mean...
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?
Relax, it's casual.
No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty...
I like the sound of that.
Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
I'm sure he's matured since then.
I had it at four.
This makes five.
Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
I should have done more, run more tests --
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.
Ben.  Are you okay?
Am <u>I</u> okay?!  You wanna explain that?!
Yeah, nine years straight.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
O-kay.  We'll skip that question.
Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.
Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Don't you wander off, boy.
They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
Really?  With a name like Von <u>Doom</u>? Never saw <u>that</u> one coming.
Out front?  You home, baby?  I got a surprise for you.
I already got it.  Everything I want.
I'm worried about you.
What is this?  Where's Reed?
Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
Oh, he did.
<u>What</u> did he do to the uniform?!
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
Victor must've taken him.
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
That's terrible news...
Ben!  Ben!
Cool.  What'd it do to you guys?
You've been working out.
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
I can go hotter!
What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
But all these people...
<u>Now</u>.
So are you!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
I though we went over this.
Last one down springs for room service.
No: You're <u>ON FIRE</u>!
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
Okay, "mom."
I think that thing is Ben.
Is that a trick question?  C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Dude.  That's my sister.
No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
But Johnny...you <u>can't fly</u>.
Showtime.
Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Later.  First, I've got some unfinished business.  A deal that needs closing...
Reed, we're running out of time.
<u>Ben</u> did this?
<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --
It's been changed.
Yes, thanks.
That's good.  That's uh...good.
Passion.
What?  What do you mean you --
That's what we're here to find out.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
Of course.  Of course.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...
No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
<u>I'm</u> not the only one in there.  I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
I'm sure I can come up with something.
A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
Raising the shields.
You can't leave them out there.
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Just <u>find</u> him.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Same old Reed.  All analysis, no action.  Wasn't that the problem with you two?
Oh, I think you already have.
Victor, we <u>can't do anything</u> until the research is ready.
Medical's ready.
Phase Two.
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
I know that. But what's the maximum?
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.
Message to Proteus.
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
Let's find what the devil's holding them up!  Contact the Proteus!
I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
Well, how about hypnosis? That can't hurt him!
The Other Side got to him.
How bad off is he?
Brain injury.
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
No question of her loyalty.
Say that again?
Trip? Where to?
As part of the Crew.
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
It's only for an hour --
Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
He's blanked out on that one particular point.
Glad to have you with us, Mr. Grant.
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
With no laser --
Yes, Cora.
I -- I want to say...
They're much smaller than bacteria...
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
You may learn to like it.
Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
I always thought it was nothing but red.
And if it should take more time to get through --
But I did. I'm positive!
I have no idea.
A surgeon might...
I've got a source. All I have to do is tap it.
I can't till the hatch is flooded!
I feel much better now...
That's what they pay me for.
A great deal more than that, I believe...
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
What gives you that idea?
Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
It's too late now. We must go on.
That's not the purpose of this mission.  Captain -- keep a straight course -- until you're in the clear.
All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
You left something out.
What's that?
The Breath of God...
Everything can be divided in half, no matter how minute.
They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs.
No, there's no other way.
Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
What about Dr. Michaels?
It's too late!
How are you, Miss Peterson?
If there's any chance --
Request removal, Mr. Grant.
There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.
Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
Let's hope... So far, somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
That line was tampered with...
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
It's possible --
Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
Where we going?
Go ahead.
I'm married.
And she said it was indelible...
That makes two of us.
Remind me to ask you about the love life of an octupus.
Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
Enough to breathe, but that's all.
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
We can get out through the Lab Section.
I could use a lawnmower...
I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
Then don't drift down further.
I'll do what I can.
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here.
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
May I have your ticket, please?
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
No Jean, no money!
Is this a fucking joke here?
Unghh... oh, geez...
It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
...What're you talking about?
Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
What?
I need ...unguent.
Jezhush.
No, that's not it, Jerry.
Huh?
Well, okay, it's -
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
Yeah, you already said that.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
My wife! What the - how's -
What the heck d'ya mean?
Oh, geez.
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay, real good, then.
Any others?
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
They can really take over, that's for sure.
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
Where'd you get him that parka?
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Oh, don't be silly.
Mr. Mohra?
Yah.
Officer Olson.
Yah, right-o.
Uh-huh - in what way?
Just a general way.
Yah, got a front movin' in.
Ya got that right.
Pretty darn good, ya want some?
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
Uh-huh.
Yah.
Chaska.
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
Can you be any more specific?
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like.
A subconscious-type thing.
Yah, that can happen.
Uh-huh.
You're not a C student.
You know what a disparity is?
Yah, geez, Scotty. I'll go talk to him.
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
Yah.
Ya kiddin'!
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
My father-in-law, he's the owner.
...Brainerd?
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
but do you know that for sure without -
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here. I'm cooperating... There's no, uh - we're doin' all we can...
Sir? Right now?
Sure right now! You're darned tootin'!
I'm sorry, sir, I -
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Yah, real good.
Dad's here.
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
Okay, real good, then.

Well, what do ya mean?
Jerome Lundegaard?
Yah!
Good day, sir.
...Yah.
It's okay, Scotty.
Where're you going?
I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
Yah.
Stan Grossman called.
Twice.
Okay.
...Is everything okay?
Yah.
Well... I'm goin' ta bed now.
Whatcha watchin' there?
Norstars.
...Who they playin'?
A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?
I know it's a lot.
What's goin' on there?
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
We might be innarested.
2:30.
What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
Yah.
We're good to loan in.
Yah.
Now come on here, no way, Wade!  No way!
No, see -
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Well, I don't vouch for him.
Well, that's okay, I just -
I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?
Well - it's cold, Margie.
Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
Geez, you okay, Margie?
I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
Yah?
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
Let's go take a look at that trooper.
Yah?
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
You don't think he's mixed up in -
No, no, I just wanna get Norm some night crawlers.
Yah.
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
Yah.
That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
Ya gotta eat a breakfast...
Aw, Norm.
Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven.  I hope I dint wake you.
Well, how the heck are ya?
Okay, ya know. Okay.
Yah?
Oh, pretty good.
Just a Diet Coke.

No, no, that's fine.
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
I always liked ya so much...
No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...
Anyone else residing there?
Nope.
Yah, is this Marge?
Yah?
...Well, yah. Who's this?
Norm?
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
Linda.
No.
Linda Cooksey?
Geez. Well - geez. That's a suprise.
Yah.
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
Gustafson's accountant.
Yah.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Still missing. We're looking.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.

There's the car! There's the car!
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
Don't go in! Wait for back-up!
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
Yah?
Prowler needs a jump.
Thanks, hon.
They're real good.
Yah, ya think?
Not on your feet too much?
No, no.
Yah, it's good. No pike yet, but it's good.
Yah.
Three-cent stamp.
Yah.
Norm, that's terrific!
It's terrific!
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
That's terrific.
I love you, Norm.
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
Congratulations, Jerry.
Well... Why don't we...
Where's Tyler?
The first rule of Project --
Right, right.
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
Better than I've ever been in my life.
Really?  Great.  Still "Remaining Men Together?"
Really, what's that?
You are?!
Look at my face.
Yeah, both of us.
Yes.
Some of it, yes.
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
Pretend you're me.  You find this. What would you do?
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
Does this sound strange to you?
Dynamite?
It means it was homemade.
This is... really a shock...
I'll ask the questions, son.
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
Can't you give me something?
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
Sure.
Practicing what?
Go ahead.  I'll expose you.
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
Really?
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
Please.  Can't we do something... ?
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
I don't know -- am I?
You can't have the whole brain!
So far, you have four and I only have two!
Then, take blood parasites.  It's yours.  Now we each have three.
We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
You haven't been going to yours.
I found a new one.
Really?
Like testicular cancer?
Look, this is a bad time...
So you're staying in tonight?
What... ?
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Good.
Here.
There?
Here.
Here.
Feel anything?
Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
You feel nothing?
Nothing.
No... no problem.
I could check your prostate.
Uh ... nah.
Well... thanks, anyway.
Whatever.
When?
Do you care?
I don't know.
Hear what?
That... sawing and hammering.
... A person.
Guy or girl?
Why would you get bent if I asked?
Let go of me...  Leave me alone.
You're afraid to say.
Can I come in?
He's not here.
What?
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
Is that what you're calling it?
Answer the question!
What did you say... ?
What is wrong with you?
Say my name.
What... ?
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
Marla...
Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll never have to see me again.  Here... here...
Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away a couple of weeks, at least.
Don't ask.
Yes.
I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm fine...
Who's this?
Tyler?
Who's this?
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
You fucking slut!!
... You know me?
Is this a test, sir?
You were in here last Thursday night.
Is this part of the test?
Please return your seatbacks to their full upright and locked position.
Tyler Durden.
What do you want me to do?
I mean -- for a living.
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
How's that working out for you?
Being clever.
Well, uh... great.
And, now it's gone.
All gone.
Delivered from Swedish furniture.
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
Delivered from Martha Stewart.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
Do what you like.
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
Yeah.
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Can I stay at your place?
Yes, you can.
Thank you.
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
Don't watch.  I can't if you watch.
You get the idea.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
Where do you want it?  In the face?
Like hell.  That counted.
Strange.
But a good strange.
Is it?
The fight.
What fight?
My dad.  No question.
What car?
What?
Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
Alive or dead?
Doesn't matter.
Hemingway.  You?
Shatner.  William Shatner.
Okay... Ghandi.
Good answer.
You?
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm fine.
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
Hey... don't knock librarians.
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
Listen... do me a favor... sit here a minute...
Promise you won't.
Yes, I promise.
Promise?
I said I promise!
That was three times you promised.
Uh... nah...
A liposuction clinic.
I was going to my cave to find my power animal.
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
We don't need him...
We don't... ?
You quit?
Yeah.  Where you headed?
Work.  Going to work.
Nothing.  Do what you like.
Fucking sweet.
Okay, and... and...
I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.
I thought you did.
Homework assignment.
Tell him!
Imagine how he feels.
Hey.
No.
What should I have told you?
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?!
Nothing.
... is over.
Wait a minute...
What's this all about, Tyler?
Why do people think I'm you?
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
Answer me, Tyler.
Why do people think anything?
I don't know!  Tell me!
You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...
What... what are you saying?
It's okay.  We okay... a little codependent, sure, but...
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
You took me to the house.
The house is rented in your name.
You have jobs.
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
What about Marla?
What about Marla?
She's... you... you're fucking her.
I can't let you...
...stop me?
I'm not going...
...to let this happen!
Stop finishing...
You don't know that.  There could still be people inside.
This is not about martyrdom.
Green?  Did you say green?
I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.
You want out?
I quit.
What?
Defuse the bomb.
Defuse the bomb, please.
Defuse the bomb?
Yes.
It's out of our hands.  This is it.
Paraffin.
What?
Do we have to do everything ourselves?!
Proceed with remote detonation.
Why what?
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
You will.  You know you will.
What have you left for me?
It's the only way to get rid of you...
What?
Appreciate something.
Look at me...
My eyes are open.
Maintenance.
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
You told me you'd say that.
Abort the plan.
You told me you'd say that, too.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
Well, sir, you said you might.
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
No!
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
Irvine?  Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.
Really?
It's free to all.
Ain't that something?
Yes, it is.
You're welcome to join our club.
You and your friend.
Pleeeeeease!
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
Let go of me!!
Why?
Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
No, please, no, God, no!
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
I hope you're ready for this.
I...I...
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
Yeah, fuck 'em.  No offense.
I have to save Eugene!
He probably already knows we're coming.
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
Yeah, you should have specified.
Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
Of course not.  That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
I've got to stop and help those people.
Do you want to deliver this baby?
Maybe.  What's this about?
May we come in?
No.  What's this about?
Take a guess.
Anyway, I guessed it right and won these.
We have to tell her she's in danger!
I did.  And right now, I don't think she cares.
Who is this guy, anyway?
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
How do you know?
I know how it feels to be dead.
Impossible.  She was on the onramp.
I know.  I can feel it too.
Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
No, I'm good.
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
I can live with thaaaa --
I guess so.
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
Hey, Dad.  What's up?
I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
That it's not over yet.
I love you too, Dad.  Goodnight.
I know, we'll be there soon.
Who am I, David Blane?
Yeah?
Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
Remember the gate number?
Thirty-nine.
Like... 4:25.
Right. April 25th.
Most kids never have it happen.
They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
Let us out!
Easy, Billy, just open it.
Don't do it! Don't do it!
No! No! Don't!
Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
I wish you were on the plane!
Look, there's something you should all know.
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
It doesn't matter who's next... we're all on the same list.
Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
Oh, you've noticed it, too?
No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.
No harm. No foul.
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
No one's that strong.
Terry's name should be on this wall.
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
You have a responsibility to tell me.
Not with us in the fuckin' car!
That's what I'm doin'!
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
Yeah.  Second set.  Let's go.
That's what I'm here for.
Read you.
This is state-of-the-art firepower.
There are no worse places.
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
Damn!  Leeches.
I had it cupped.
Fermented fish sauce.
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
Powerful warrior.
I need a vacation.
Alright.  Home run.
Nothing we can do, man.
I suppose you have...
Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?
What... whattaya do?
You comin'?
Duck soup.
How much we got left in that minigun?
It means "virgin."  My mother was comedian.
I thought he was with you.
Intelligence work.
Huntington Beach, California.
You think you are... .
Invulnerable.
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch "Dynasty."
I couldn't get you in.
How?
It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
That's an order.
Sorry, Sir.
I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
Not yet.
I'm not jumping blind.
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
I was crossed-trained in gunships.
That's right.
He... took it.
About 22 hours on site.
Nice work.
Couple hours.  Let me buy you a coffee.
I know.
Have fun.
American.  Come to get you out.
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
Can you walk?
Colonel.
Mind if I sit down?
I could take it or leave it.
That's it.  My life.
Those men are all dead.
You're not.
Yeah.  Big time.
What did you want?
This just occurred to somebody, now?
Yeah.
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.
Fine.
It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything.
Yeah!
The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat.
Why this is outrageous!...
Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?...I'll cook tonight.
It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
<u>What</u>!
<u>Oh my God</u>... <u>What did they do</u>!  <u>My</u> <u>God</u>!!!
You're all right... you sure...
I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --
You still believe in God?
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
And who's Lydia?
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
What does that mean?
See, I told you!
Well, what the hell does that mean?
Thank you very much.
My agent.  I called my agent.
You're kidding!  What did he say?
No, it's not... Come here...
Right now, I'm just not sure about... making such definite plans.
Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
I... I... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called Babbitt's...
Uh... basement I think...
<u>I tell him no visitors</u>!!!
I'm... just looking for Parry...
He's not here.
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
No...no...we can't...we can't..
Venice...Like Katherine Hepburn in SUMMERTIME. . ....Why can't I be Katherine Hepburn...
I'm a man with a mission, Jack.
NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
Come on now...You can't sit here.
Leave me alone...I wanna go...
I... I was just leaving.
Good.  You believe this drunk?
<u>No</u>...<u>No</u> <u>please</u>...!
How un-sixties of you.
I was nine in the sixties.
Yeah?  Who is this?
<u>No!</u>  <u>I told you</u>! <u>You won a contest</u>!
Yes.  They're free.
Tonight!  How's tonight?
"OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!
I know a great place.  ...UH...WARREN!
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
My name is Parry.
Hi... Where are my shoes?
They're --  -- What?
Where -- ?
<u>What</u>!?
Sshhhh!
They said you're The One.
I'm the one what?
<u>Oh shut up</u>!!!
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
Take a guess...  <u>Let him guess</u>!!  <u>Tch</u>.
They work for Him.
Him...?
Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
Parry... I'm Jack.
I know...
Funny -- you look married.
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
What's her name?
I don't know.
No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
Can I take you to lunch?
Well what am I gonna do with it?
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
So what? You going to help me?
The Red...?  You're totally gone, aren't you?
It's a classic.
What?
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
<u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
Ha, ha, ha, ha rubbish...now begone...before somebody drops a house on you!...
BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!
You advise us!
You're out numbered son.
OWW...MAN...
No just Parry.
Oh...like Moses.
I don't like horror movies!
Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
There isn't any more to tell.
Don't say that.
You don't have to say that.
I never say anything I have to.
Listen, I'm not feeling well.
No.
Divorced.
No, I...
You have a disease.
Will you stop!...  ... I'm in love with you...
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
Well, lemme play the other side then.
I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
Now, now.
No, dammit, I would easy.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
That's right, hand.
Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
You got another ball comin'.
You just going to sit there?
I hope they do.
You're the pathetic one, not me.
I'm going on over there...
I know you're not.
You treat me like I was.
I'm sorry.
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
You'll be gone, period.
I love it.
What the hell is that?
Is what you?
You're depressed that I come along.
Who said I was depressed?
Well, is that a happy face I see?
Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...
If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
It brings out my eyes...
What?
Just finish eating.
You got any change?
Fill it up.
Palm Apodaca.
Alaska.
Alaska? Are you on vacation?
No. How much do I owe you?
Five'll do it.
I'll come back when you've made up your mind...
Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
Hi, Tita.
Now don't...
That's good.
Don't, then.
Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
No kidding.
Very nice.
Everybody still up on the Island?
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
Robert, I have to tell you something...
Daddy's very ill.
Oh, well, what, what's he...
He's had two strokes.
Wait...
Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't I?
All right...
A couple of months.
It's not that bad.
A week or two isn't going to ruin your life, for Godsakes.
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
What?
Why are you being so mean?
I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't you see that?
You know, he was formerly a sailor.
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
My turn.
Where's Catherine?!
I don't know where she is!
Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?!
You were going without saying goodbye?
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
But what about me?
I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
Bye, Robert.
That's dangerous, you know.
Swimming?
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
If you're free.
Yeah, I'll probably be free.
Of course I do. It's music. You know...
Thank you.
You had no inner feeling?
None.
At being a fake.
I think it's what you think.
No, it isn't what I think.
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
I'd like you to leave now. Is that direct enough?
Yes, that's what's important to me...
Shut up...
That's right.
I don't believe vou.
Something witty and devastating like that.
Yes.
What?
What?! I can't hear you!
That'll make you happy.
No, the last time was three years ago.
Is she?
What?
Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.
Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
You're all full of shit!
It's a Borzoi.
Besides being very rude.
I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
Well, I should hope not...
Jesus, what a rude person...
Don't call me "mack," honey.
Hold onto this.
I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't really discussing media...
Perhaps...
Yes.
If you want to call it that.
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
Fine.
Look at me.
Not now, I'm busy
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
I'm wit' Carlos.
Victor.
What?
Victor.
Wussup.
Hi.
Remember me, from the pool?
Um. Yeah! Shorty!
Nothin'.
What are you doin' here?
I, umm, came to see you.
You know somebody around here?
No.  What you do today?
I just wanted to see you.
Of course.
So what's her name?
You got a boyfriend?
That's it?
You look good.
How you treat them?
Good. I'm faithful to them.
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
I can't!
Wussup, Victor.
Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.
I got punished, man.
Fa what?
She fucks it all up!
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
I can't man, I'm punished!
Natasha, Maria, Tina-
Pitt.
Eddie from Compost?
No, Baruch.
You know, Eddie's cousin.
I think she lives down by Pitt.
I think by Twenty-two.
For real?
What you want with her anyway'
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
You said before, that he got boxes?
You gonna talk to him?
Um, yeah I think so.
Okay, then dance. Show.
Wha'?
You here to see somebody?
Yeah.
Who?
A girl named Amanda.
What she look like?
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
Yo, that's my girl.
She didn't say she had no man.
You sure?
Positive.
Your friend must be misinformed.
Didn't I see you at Pitt yesterday?
I'm a good friend of hers.
How do I know you're not lying.
What?
Nothing.
So, then whadda ya want?
Hey!
Wha'?
Jus' from around the way.
You live around here?
Yeah.
You gotta girLfrLend?
You mean her.
What?
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
Wonder who his supplier is.
I have no idea.
I wasn't asking.
Creasy, how old are you?
Nineteen.
Fletch, this is dumb.
You don't have to run with me, Crease.
They didn't do anything.
What? What are you talking about?
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
Not luck. They don't want me.
Full name.
Fletch F. Fletch
I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights.
Ask anybody.
Can I ask anybody now?
That a boy.
Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Thank God, the police.
Go ahead. Make my evening.
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
We play tennis at the club.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
Yes.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
Two bs?
One. B-a-b-a-r.
That's two.
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
Still, it'd an odd name. I don't remember seeing it on the club registry.
Mrs. Smith.
Joan or Margaret Smith.
Right.
Well, which one?
Margaret.
Funny old bird.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
Oh, he was dying for years.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant.
No idea at all?
Okay. Some idea.
Like when?
Like tonight.
For sure?
You don't know me.
My pleasure.
I'm serious, Sam.
What, the heat here?
Affirmative.
The two surfer boys?
Affirmative.
Thought so. What for?
Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
You find the source?
Gum thought Brazil.
Where am I?
You're in the Records Room.
I'm fine.
Can I get you something?
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
Thank you.
He'll be so relieved.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
Until she remarries, Fletch.
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
I agree.
Are you serious?
Wait a minute! Our problems might be solved.
Wait a second --
Cut the crap and read it.
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
Well, I'm fully covered.
Since he moved to L.A.
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
Course he has. That's his wife.
Of course they are.
You sure did.
Right.
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
What are you doing here?
Hi Gummy. Hows the eye?
Its okay. The cops did it.
They busted me last week.
I know. I got bad luck or something.
Fletch?
What's that?
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
Twenty years.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
That's Brazil.
Yeah. Maybe.
Wait here for me, Gummy.
Why not?
Because we can't.
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
Alan Stanwyk.
I'm all ears.
I want you to murder me.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
I have the same problem with my help.
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
I don't think you'll have to worry about that.
Sure, all drifters do.
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
They serve dinner on the flight?
You sure got the hard part.
Sure.
Only if you promise not to return me.
'Magic' today, huh?
Don't say shoot, okay.
Not me.
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
Spot right here.
I wonder if that's his doctor.
Only one way to find out.
That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back burner for a while.
Yeah.
Nothing to it.
I'm sorry?
His bride. Cute as a button.
Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
How about Marvin's sixty-fifth birthday party?
John! You used to fly together!
John Ultrarelamensky.
That's a strange combination.
Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!
I bet you do.
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
John Ultramalensky?
Hi.
Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
You ordered it here?
I saved his life during the war.
You were in the war?
No. He was. I got him out.
Can I ask you a question?
Depends on the question.
Are you still in love with Alan?
What is this?
Long story.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
That's what I want to know.
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
But I've seen the deed.
You saw a forgery.
I'll take you to a game.
What are you talking about?
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
I was afraid you'd say that.
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
I checked. There was no divorce.
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
You can't do that.
They're trying to kill me!
You shouldn't be here.
I want to hear this.
They just left, sir.
In her cabana, sir.
One.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
Sierra del fuego.
Lock's busted.
No wonder.
Who are you?
Moved out.
She moved out?
So you're saying she moved out.
This morning.
Tell the cops.
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
Irwin...
...never reads the paper...
I don't know.  Look!
Looks great.
So let's go! We run the pictures.
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
I'd say charcoal.
I have some ideas.
Who? Donnie and Marie?
I want something I can print!
Print this Frank.
What?  Who the hell are they?
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
Forget it.
You were going to can me, right?
Not really?
I was upset.
Yeah.
Who's Frieda?
My secretary.
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
In a minute!
But I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
Please.
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
Excuse me?
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
Actually, you may take it all now.
Oh... I have some questions.
Nuthin'.
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
Have what?
Did she tell you anything?
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
Hold that thought.  Are we being shot at?
Thanks, I needed that.
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
All your friends call you Jazz.
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
Go on, 'they're stahting.'
Make eye contact when you say that.
Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
You're not funny.
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so...
Three hundred.
Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.
Fluck you!
What?
Peachy.
Why are all these people after me?
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
You didn't ask.  Have you ever thought about mousse?
People still watch that?
Who cares about people?
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Are you okay?
Ye-ah.
Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
No, wait...
Ye-ah.
This is fucking unbelievable.  Zuzu, it's a long story, you see...
You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.
Yeah, Ford.  I'm okay.
Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
Did he just say what I think he said?
I don't need it that bad.
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
Liar!  You don't care!  About anything.
Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really.
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
Fine!
What's fine?
I'm off it!
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
The case!
Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
Okay.  'B-y-e!
Anyway you want it, asshole.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Go on, another time, another place.
Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
Ah, I didn't say seven <u>P</u>.M., now did I?
Are you okay?
Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
Ciao.
Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
Julian, you're fired.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
Only on a first name basis.
That's funny, you're cute.
I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
Hey, the poet...
Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.
It is to us!  It's computerised.
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
What?
Doyle.
What?
Mr. Doyle.
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
You don't use shit?
No. 
Cause if I do.
Everything is everything.
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
B.O.C.A.
Doesn't register.
Got a wife named Angie.
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
Where do you want it?
This side.
Takin' care o' business, honey.
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
You know I hadda meet some people tonight --
Yeah?
Fuck you, Santa Claus!
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
No... yeah...
Enchant.  Alain, j'ai rflchi  votre proposition et j'ai dcid d'accepter.
It is waiting for you in the garage.
I wasn't looking.
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
Who's this --
... Salvatore?...
Yes --
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
It's yours too!
Si tu veux.
Pour moi?
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Non!
I'm going to put them on the cat.
Il fallait le faire.
Il est en retard.
We must follow it.
But will they?
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
S'right.
Fake it.
He got off on six.
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
No, I figure he stays here.  Where's your registration?
Des Moines.
What's he do?
Marseilles.

Why not?
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
Yeah!
Where the hell is it?
When ya go back on?
Morning.  Sometime.
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
How'd I know he had a knife.
Never trust a nigger.
He coulda been white.
Not a chance.
Whip it out.
Policy man in Queens.
He probably sells insurance.  Owns a chicken farm in Hackensack.
The greaser with the blonde.
Toy wit' this will ya.
We're goin' now!  Goodbye.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
I can't.
Four.
Third time around.
Hiya, Jesus.
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
What was it?
It was a crematorium.
For garbage?
For dead bodies.
You remember Mary Finelli?
What are you saying?
No, I don't.
Well, I think you do.
They around?
Where's the collar, in the cells?
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
You're shitting me!
We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
The game, Graham.  The Series?
Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
I should'a been a fucking mailman.
I'm alright, Gibby.
Don't know what's behind it.
Elvis has left the building.
Well, why not a little of the King?
You alright?
The usual.
Did he?
He did.
Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long as you get there.
You give him his drops?
Probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work...
I love you more.
He ain't the only one.
Wish you weren't.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
I know.  He loves that thing.
Frank...
Luck, my ass.
Hello, Frank.
No, I don't.
Do you know where I found this?
No.  This isn't what you think.
Uh, huh.
Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
Next time lets put some money on it.
Get him home safe.
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
Glad to hear that.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
Daddy, I'm scared.
C'mon, Chief, show some guts.
I'll be up soon, Little Chief.
Wait...
I'm right here behind you...
WB2YKXB, who've I got?
Name's John.
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
Queens, New York.
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
What'd you just say?
Oh, that was my kid.
Uh huh...
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
29-years ago.
Nothing...I just spilled something.
You just burned the desk.
What's happening?
What if it's not...
Johnny...?
I don't know.
I'm thirty-five years old.
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
Yeah...I think so.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
Nah, I gave it up.
I think I'm losing you.
No wait, don't go!
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
I lost you.
What?
I never knew you, Dad.
Why?
Fire.
On the job?
It did, Pop.  It did.
October 12, 1969.
I don't understand.
Yeah, it's me.
Are you alright"?
Something happened, something...
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
It's Mom.
What?  What is it?
She's not here.
Whatta you mean she's not here?
She just died, your mother just died?
October 22, 1969.
I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
What are we like in...1998?
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
Yeah, you betcha.
I'm right here, Dad.
You all right?
Yeah, I think so...
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
In my pocket.
We got him!  Dad you got him!
Please, Dad, just do it.
Okay, okay...
Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder.  John...
What's wrong?
What the hell is that smell?
I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
I know pal.  I remember.  Twenty-nine years tomorrow.
Better.
What?
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago.
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
Whoa, I just...I just...
Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him, it was real.
Which means he probably knew her.
This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
What?
Yeah.  Sure.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
So how are things at the hospital?
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
You work too hard, John.
Look who's talking.
Are you a good cop, John?
I try to be.
Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
I'm sorry.  I didn't realize...  But she knew, John.  A mother knows what's in her son's heart.
Glad you did.  Come on in.  Buy you a cup of coffee?
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
I look familiar?
No.  What house you work?
A hot shot, huh?
Nah, just working the job.
I hear that.
Going?  How do you mean?
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
Where's Shelly?
I don't know...
I'll think of something.
I vote for the hammock.
Yes, man!
And Hell is hot, but I ain't goin' down there either.
This is all the exercise I need...
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
Don't do that to me!
Will you come with me?
Be a man, man.
Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?
I don't know.  I flunked Spanish.
You go ahead...
Your bed.
A hammock?
Why?
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
I don't know.
You're irresistible.  I lose control.
Nothing.
No.  I got here just before you did.
Somebody was in here.
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
Are you all right, Shelly?
No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
What do you mean?
You promised you'd never ask me.
Sure, just watch where you're going.
Sort of.
You're Shelly?
I'm sorry.
My whole world.
In that little thing?
Stick around and you'll see.
Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry.
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Everything's gonna be fine.
Excuse me, but I believe that's mine...
May be please have the wallet.
Yes.
Gulp!
Keep looking.
Maybe.
Just keep your eyes on the road.
Stop the car!  Now!!
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
I have to.
You don't "have to."
I just want you to like me.
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
I never said you were "nothing".
What?  Who pulled it out?!
No way...  ...I wanna rock!
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
Why?
We're gonna scare him?!
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
Just drive.  He'll get out of our way.
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
Better call an ambulance first.
I wish it was.
Happy Friday the 13th.
You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
I could swear I heard...
This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
Yeah, that's fat too.
Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
And make sure my daughter stays put...  ...She's grounded.
It's just beginning.
What's it to ya?
No.
Why?
'Cause it stinks.
Wait a minute. I just...
Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
Did you hear me?!
Yes.  And I said, hand me those padlocks.
I found it outside.
That's debatable.
Huh?
We'll scare 'em right back.
Boy scouting.
You gotta be kidding!
Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
Yeah, we're here.
I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
I think somebody's messin' around out there.
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
I've seen it.
Yeah...They should've paid their bill.
How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
Save your...
I'm here.
I'm scared.  I'm very scared.
I need to talk to you.
I'm kind of busy right now...
You food'll be right out.
Twenty.
Look --
Look, I don't want your money!
I know everything about you, Diana.
That's it, we're done.
It's going.
Legs giving you trouble?
Not so bad, today.
Do you have to ask?
Yeah, she's good, considering. That kid just takes everything in stride.
Okay, I'll call you later.
N...nothing.
June the 19th.
So's he and he knows it.
Good night, beautiful.
'Night, Josh.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
That's what I'd like to know.
Tell me.
Sorry.
Tell me!
Her name's Stephanie.
She's yours?
Hell, when Steven was a kid, he was like, having strippers delivered to church Bingos and shit.
Next, you dial a number.
Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
Have a good night.
Don't do anything stupid.
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
He was dead.  He had to be dead...
Until I hear the truth.
I've told you the truth.
You don't know shit!
I didn't kill her!
About Jessica.
-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a- bitch...
But she might be in trouble...
What are you going to do?
Improvise, of course.
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice.
Yeah.
But...wait a minute!
Ask me in about five minutes.
Nothing.
Hear what?
And you'll never do it again.
Rennie's not coming.
It's...dead.
What?? You sent her out there with a murderer running around loose??
The fire alarm...
Not another word, do you hear me??
Don't be ridiculous!
I packed it. Just for us.
But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
Don't be. They probably decided to explore each other rather than New York.
She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
Walking corpses are not real!
What are you talking about?
Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
A wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson.
I don't think that's such a safe idea
My niece's life hangs in the balance right now!! Every second counts.
Am I? Let's find out.
You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
She didn't push me into coming.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
But Sean said...
This isn't a request.
I...I can't...
You can and you will!!
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
Just felt a little chill.
Yeah...a lot.
I gathered that.
I...I don't know...
Hi, Sean.
I heard you weren't coming.
We changed our minds.
But I didn't get you one...
Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway.
I want to go home. I want off this ship.
Just radio for help, okay???
The window...
But Rennie...
I'm not!!
Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
Please, hurry...
Where you're going, mister?
I opened thousands of brains.
What did you find?
Big mess every time.
Crosstown.
Very bad today.
What do you mean, we must abandon?
Ruptured steam pipe.
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
Do not inhale.
That's where I peed.
Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
Alla puttanesca.
Quietly effective.
Press a button and they give us money.
Ride with me. We need a haircut.
Don't talk like that.
It's over, finished and done with.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
But didn't we know it would happen?
Asbestos lining.
We must abandon.
Do not inhale.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
You mean because What's-His-Name.
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
What happened eighteen months ago?
A year and a half later? You're still brooding?
I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me.
Do we care?
I think we Nought to wait.
I say we go.
You say we go?
Do not inhale.
I'm not ready.
Here we go.
Don't wait Efor me.
What about the haircut?
Then you should carry a gun.
No, we're not.
He'll hate it.
How do you Eknow.
Paisley Porter.
What do you mean?
She was very evasive.
Unbelievable.
Classic.
What are we talking about?
Yes. What are you implying?
You're not making sense. Make sense.
This could be it.
Let's work on it.
Let's work on it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
Does it feel comfortable?
Does what feel comfortable?
This could be it.
This could be it.
What about her?
She's dying.
She died.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
In and out of bed.
Because we're completely mismatched.
We don't even like each other, do we?
It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
They'll lose because they're my team.
I go to college. I thought you knew.
Do you want to get some coffee?
What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?
Why do you need a radio?
Is it?
And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
I just had breakfast with her. She didn't say a word about this.
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
I don't have a date. I don't want a date.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
Everything.
There's nothing left for me to lie about.
It's only our first date.
Brilliantly moving.
Packs an emotional wallop.
What else?
A flat-out hit.
This building is not secure.
Mystery. Deception.
You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?
It's your best play, Nicky.
See, Daddy.
Two-all after six.
All right. What's been going on?
Who the hell cares?
And you've been extremely patient.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
Alma Wetzel.
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
It violates so many trusts.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
They're always winning. Until they lose.
Life is good.
Washed away.
One more out.
A thousand things.
You're hurting my head.
This could be it!
Life is real.
I'm at the door.
Pop, will you let me in?
Where the hell are you?
Right here. At the door.
It's me. Nicky.
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
I could have grown up happy. A Yankee fan. A divorce lawyer.
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
Let's not start that again.
My back is killing me.
Where's your elastic brace?
I can't find it.
What do you want me to do?
Show him who we are.
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
How come you got the kid with you?
A grandmother. God bless you.
That's a simple subject.
What am I doing?
You're charming the boy.
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
It's a simple subject.
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
It may be work but it's not honest work. Faith is the real work.
Speak it like it's real. Matthew.
Matthew.
Because life is good.
Because faith is rewarded.
It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
This could be it!
Why does it matter?
They're my team.
appreciate that, Sidney. But our leading man can't remember his lines. And his understudy can't carry the play.
How come?
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
Eleventh inning. What else?
Sidney.
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
Yes.
Mine was cobalt blue.
I think I remember.
So does Elliot.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
Oh. You know him.
A little.
Engaging.
Say it again.
What?
You know what.
Alla puttanesca.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
So do I. Over and over.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
The fact is, I have to get going.
He wears a disguise.
I don't know.
He's a very sweet man.
Where are you going now?
Home.
Someone waiting for you?
No one's waiting.
I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
Never mind.
I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
I'm going home to my machine.
They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
Yes -- I can't talk like this.
It is the work of untouchables.
All the more reason.
There's no room! And the air is lovely.
Eleven.
"I will follow close behind you and help to serve the people."
"I will follow you in all our vows and duties."
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
One more.
Going nearer to God!
I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
What was he like?
He said he's in charge...
No, no -- just a moment, please.
We must end the campaign.
You will respect the law.
There are unjust laws -- as there are unjust men.
I hope not.
A great deal.
An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.  We must stop.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
It's split the Government.
Well, that's one victory.
Thank you. No.
I dined at the prison.
Ahh.
Oh!  Neither have I.  I'm awfully sorry.
There are a few million miles to go yet.
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
Who are you trying to convince?
Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.
It would be five thousand more.
No?  What's keeping you?
I guess I'm a slow learner.
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.
We don't have the manpower.
Where do we start?
Where did you get this?
What a relief.
This time I will supervise each test personally.
Hello, sweatheart.  Come on up.
It's about the Director.
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
You have more in common than you know.
He's too tall.
Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
You had to be a right-hander.
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent.
The Mission Director.
You wish.
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
So what?  You didn't kill him, did you?
Keep going!!  Keep going!!
How long do you stay up there before you go?
You know I'm scared of heights.
I'm proud of you, Vincent.
Any particular reason?
We can't stay here.
What are you talking about?
They think I offed the Director.
They found my eyelash.
Where?
In a corridor.
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
I'm sure I could have.
If you say so.  The stripe.
Good choice.
I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
She doesn't <i>have</i> to know.  She doesn't <i>want</i> to know.
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
Again?
Michael's.
You may as well invite her here.
I was never very good at it, remember?
Not bad, Jerome.
How the hell did you get here.
In case you get back before I do.
Where are you going?
I'm travelling too.
We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".
German, is that you?
Vincent, come down.  I've found him.
Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
There's a way.
You worried about the cost?
Not that.
I've found him too.
No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
Were <i>you</i> alone?
Yes.
Why would we do that?
We were just looking.
I know about you.
Friend?
They found an eyelash.
Where?
In the South Wing.
Does it have a name?
Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
You celebrate, Jerome?
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
You're angry--
You'll be next.
I guess somebody beat me to it.
Let's walk.
Who are they?
We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
We could go together one day.
Not so long--just once around the sun.
New policy.
There's a problem, Lamar.
I can't do this.
I'm not doing it.
Honey, you've made <i>one</i> mistake--
Antonio--
I heard about you. You work with Miller.
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
I'll take care of my end.
Stay clean.
Beynon.
News said two persons killed.
And you got him...
That's right.
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
Hi.
You okay?
My license expired, let's get out of here.
Yeah.
I want to take a walk.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
I've been there every day for the last four years.
Small town, small bank, big money.
I've been doing my homework.
Just like old times?
Better than old times.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Where did you get them developed?
Assumed name... Houston.
Good.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
What do you want for dinner?
Whisky and a peach.
Just the way I remembered.
Fatter... some things never change.
That's not all of it.
No. It's been a long time.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
I'm still here, Doc.
It's all right.
It's just been a while.
Sure.
Really.
Better than I remembered.
You were asleep.
Is he straight?
I couldn't have... much longer.
Yeah... I know.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
I didn't. I just waited.
Want to cry now?
Usually on the right side as you go in.
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
I mean it.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
I see it...
There are three men dead.
Do it my way.
Do it my way.
There wasn't any way to explain it.
You sent me to him.
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
If you don't start telling the truth... 
What do we do?
We keep going.
And switched keys.
He must have.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
Fifteen minutes.
I'll bet you can.
I mean it.
Why, there's nothing on the news?
I think you liked it with him.
When are you going to learn?
I did I killed a man.
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
El Paso.
Twenty eight hundred.
Not now.
No scars.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
Sure...
I don't want to hear it.
Whatever happens it's over.
You want to try with me?
Things can't get much worse can they?
I don't see how.
You and me.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
Whatever you say.
Who was it?
Just get your clothes on...
I don't know, airport I guess.
Pull over.
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
I guess we are.
We walk.
I really hope you have a nice trip.
Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
Gonna knock down a wall?
Might try that.
You were with him?
Yeah. I got out.
What about you?
Okay. How many bank exits?
Two.
What about the vault?
I'm good at that.
What do you have in mind?
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
Right.
Then you do it.
Can't leave the desk.
Suit yourself.
Just fine.
Where we go in1?
Don't you want to go to the airport?
Come on. How much?
Sure am.
And I keep my mouth shut?
That's what I want.
How about twenty thousand?
Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
Just... tell us what you want.
A Ford... We have a Ford.
How long have you been married?
Two years.
Can he trust you?
That's what matters, isn't it?
I'll tell you when.
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
Yes.
How?
When did you find out?
A couple of weeks back.
How?
Nothing. What could I do?
Yes. I told him.
What did he say?
'Good.'
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
What's it got to do with you?
This is my brother's car.
Oh ay?
Yeah.
Was the steering faulty?
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
How'd it happen, then?
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
Well?
What?
I made a mistake.
What about?
Never mind.
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
Christ, what...
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
Good evening.
Confidential, like.
Yes you can.
Who sent you, Thorpey?
Brumby!
He's got a new place at Burnham.
Doreen.
Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
I want to talk to you later.
Tomorrow morning, then?
He was all right to me.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Nicer than most.
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
Why'd you see him so regular?
Once a week?
I call that regular.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
What?
You know Sid Fletcher?
I work for him.
Do you?
Yes, I do.
Who?
Sid Fletcher.
Oh, do you?
Yes.
No, do you really?
Go on.
Yes, while he was here.
While he was here. You went about together?
He was here for four days.
Was he?
Could you do me a favour?
Could you please put my glass on the table?
So where are we going, Princess?
To the demon king's castle, of course.
Of course. Where else?
We're there now.
Is he coming here?
He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
What kind of entertaining?
Now you're asking.
Especially when I play the lead.
Not entirely. No.
You sure about that?
You've been watching the film.
Tell me about the girl.
What girl?
The young girl. Who pulled her?
I don't know.
Was it Albert?
Shouldn't think so.
Who set it up?  Eric?
Yeah.
Expect so.
Did my brother Frank find out?
Your brother? What you talking about?
Nice of you to come.
No. Frank was a good bloke.
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
No. It's all right.
Yeah.
They said he was drunk.
I left last year.
Oh, what you doing now?
Working at Woolworths.
That must be interesting.
Yes.
Yeah.
You coming to South America?
No.
At me friend's house.
Where's that?
Wilton Estate.
At the Half Moon.
That's what I was wondering.
Since when did he drink whisky?
Don't know.
Nobody seems to know.
Yes.
Where would I find him?
Today? At the races. He always goes.
Large Scotch.
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
That's what he was saying about you.
Good lad.
Where you off to?
Las Vegas.
Cliff Brumby. Ever been to Westsea?
How'd you find me?
I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
I'm staying with a friend.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
It's not like that, luv.
It never is.
Definitely.
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
My brother, Frank.
Is he staying the night?
Funny.  Can I phone London?
It'll cost you.
You don't look it.
No. Really, I am.
No, you won't.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it.
Ta-ra.
No.
Don't ask me.
You're lucky. They kill as well.
And what about you? Did you kill Brumby?
That little shit!
What about Keith?
What about Keith?
What you going to do?
Pension him off.
You're a bastard.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
What's that supposed to mean?
Think about it.
No.
Do you want breakfast?
Yes, thank you.
No. Are you tired?
No chance of that.
Not much.
They're friends of mine.
And that'll make me feel better?
I don't want to get rough, do I?
How could I stay away?
Jack Carter.
Eric. Eric Paice.
What you doing around here then?
Didn't you know this is my home town?
No, I didn't know that.
Funny, that.
No. I'm visiting relatives.
Oh, that's nice.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
That's all right, Eric.
Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Oh, you've been watching television.
That's not always a healthy way to be...
And you should know, if I remember rightly.
Still got a sense of humour?
Still got your sense of humour.
Nasty way to go.
Yes.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
He said it'd be doing him a big favour.
Shut up.
They do that up North.
What for? Protective purposes?
Knock it off, Gerald.
What? And get the clap?
You're bluffing, you bastard!
Your hundred, and another hundred.
Three hundred altogether, Harry.
Ha.
That's right.
You're not seeing me?
No.
Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
...Polacks...
Deadbeats all.
...they hold on to their money...
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
Where am I going to work?
You had to, yeah.  Why?
To get on the...
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
You ever get 'em?
Well, I think I had one once.
I...I don't know.
Well, they fucked it up.
They killed the goose.
They did.
And now...
We're stuck with this...
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
...this shit...
It is.
Eh?
It's too...
Some contest board...
I...
It's not right.
No.
Eh...?
That's right?
Eh?
He's doing very well.
Yes.
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
Starting up.
What hard part?
What act?
You...
You build it!
That's what I...
Men come work for you...
They have...
When they...
Somebody...
Yes...?
Should do something to them.
What?
Yes.
How?
Huh.
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
You haven't talked to him.
We're just "talking" about it.
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
Yes.
Talking about it as a...
No.
As a robbery.
As a "robbery"?!  No.
Well.  Well...
Hey.
Did you?
What did you say?
That's right.
Have I said that?
Did you talk to Graff?
Is that what I said?
What did he say?
What did he say?  He'd buy them.
What will he pay?
A buck a shot.
Is that what I said?
He'd give me a job.
He would take you on.  Yes.
What?  What?  The leads.
I'm sorry?
You.
Yes.
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
Why would they come to me?
They're going to come to everyone.
Why would I do it?
Are you sure?
Yes.  I'm sure.
...and rob the place...
...I thought that we were only talking...
Absolutely.
That's ridiculous.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?
In the abstract...
So I'm making it concrete.
Why?
Do you need five grand?
Is that what I just said?
You need money?  Is that the...
Yes.
Because you listened.
How ya doing?
Uh-huh.
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
Huh?
Yes.  They are old.
They're ancient.
Clear...
Clear Meadows.  That shit's dead.
It's a waste of time.
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
Everything I...you know...
They stole the...
Were the leads insured?
Yeah.
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
Yes.  The cops.  No.
They aren't?
No.
Why don't you think so?
Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
Where was I?
Yes.
Yes.
No.
You have nothing to hide.
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
Yeah.  You know who doesn't?
No, who?
Thieves.
Why?
They're inured to it.
You think so?
Yes.
Where did Moss...?  I...
Will you excuse us please?
You understand?
Did they catch...?
I'll be at the restaurant. </pre> </html>
You...
That's great.
Thank you, George.
We had a robbery. 
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
I didn't rob...
In school.
That's right.  You want to go out today...?
I want to work today, that's why I came...
The leads come in, I'll let...
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
Just go to lunch.
I don't want to go to lunch.
Go to lunch, George.
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
Excuse me, sir...
Did they get my contracts?
...did they...
Would you excuse us, please...?
You call them again.  Mr. Williamson...!
You're done, come down, and let's...
Would you come in here, please?
And let's put this together.  Okay? Shel?  Say okay.
What two?
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
...then...
...I only...
Under him?
Moss.
...you talk to Murray...
Yes.  I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.
...let me...are you listening to me...?
John.  John...
I'm out.
Yes.
The leads are assigned randomly...
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
Then put me on the board.
You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
And what if you don't close.
I will close.
And fifty bucks a lead.
I saw the board.  You've got four...
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
Good.  Now we're talking.
Now.  Yes...When?
Because I say so.
Somebody broke in.
Get 'em to me!
What are you trying to tell me?
What are you talking about?
No.  It hadn't.
You robbed the office.
Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
Who kept the other half?
That was easy, wasn't it?
Was it?
Abso...
Forget it.  Frame it.  It's worthless.
I'm sorry.
Why?
Because I don't like you.
John: John:...my daughter...
Fuck you.
Eighty-two thousand dollars.
Hey, I don't want to hear your fucking war stories...
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
"Bruce, Harriet...Fuck me, believe in yourself..."
And did they steal the contracts...?
Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
That's right.
Shelly...!
They took the phones...
Last night, this morning.
Mmm.
Guess who?
"I want to tell you something, Harriet..."
From the store.
Fuck her...
Kenilw...
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
My wife told me to look into...
Home...
Home cooking...
The monthly interview...?
Oh!  For the magazine...
Go ahead.
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...
Kenilworth...?
I'm sorry...?
Kenilworth.
Yeah.
I think I'd better stay here for a while.
Yes.
Yes.
Mmmm...
To...you know.
To change our minds.
But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...
Three business days.  They mean three business days.
I don't understand.
I'm not.
If we wait till Mon...
When did you write the check?
What was yesterday?
Tuesday.
I don't know.
It's not me, it's my wife.
What is?
I told you.
Tell me again.
Tell me again.  Your wife.
I told you.
You tell me again.
She wants her money back.
We're going to speak to her.
No.  She told me "right now."
We'll speak to her, Jim...
She won't listen.
No, Jim.
What does that mean?
That...
What...?
I...
What...?  Say the words.
I don't have the power.  I said it.
The power to negotiate.
To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?
What, "this"?
She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...
And the check is...
It's nothing.
What are the police doing here...?
Not to my knowledge, no...
Fuck the Machine.
Mountain View.  Eight units.
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
Eight units.  Mountain View.
You did that?
Guess who?
When...
Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
Why not?
They took 'em...
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
I'm going home.
Your farewell to the troops?
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
Have a good trip.
They--excuse me...
Did they...
They got, listen to me...
The...
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
Yes.
Yes.
With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
I have the stuff from last year's...
I'm giving you three leads.  You...
Three.
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your contract went out.  Nothing to...
Did you like your party?
No, where is it?
On your pillow.
I know.  How long will you be gone?
Just a few days.
Will you take me?
I can't.
Why do you have to go?
To do business.
I can help you.
Some day you will.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
At first, like everybody, I was a soldier.
Oh yes, the very best.
 What?  You read it in the papers?
 He's going to kill Fanucci.
How are the kids?
Bought at the airport.
Why do you come to me?  Why don't you go to a travel agent?
Then why do you come to me?
Because I need MONEY!
No.
The children can stay.
A hundred years...it's a toast.
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
These Eye-ties are really crazy when it comes to their wives.
I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns!
Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
No, Dad.
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
You would risk your life for strangers?
Not for strangers; for my country.
He is weak.
He will grow strong.
The child cannot harm you.
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
Let's go.
Forget it, just go take care of her.
Mio fratello.
We're making an investment in Havana.
I never met them.
That's what I'm here for.
Wait'll you see!
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
It was hard to have him killed.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
No.  I mean, are you sure?
You know otherwise, Freddie?
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
I know they get Pentangeli, that's all I know.
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
Beautiful.
I know.  That's why I brought you with me!
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
Chi?
Within the compound will be fine.
I'm going to see my parents.
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
Am I a prisoner?
That's not the way we look at it.
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
I can feel it in the way he talks to me.
She's gone, Tom.
Will you tell him?
I don't know.
Yeah, give me a minute.
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
If I'm wrong...
I took care of it.
What was it, so I'll know.
Wait... there's something else.
Alright.
Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
Mike, at three and a half...
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
And Kay...she's all right?
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
I want it met.
Twenty-five this time.
Mike wants it.
No questions.
How do I know you haven't gone into business for yourself?
Did my brother go back?
Yeah, but don't worry.
Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to dinner.  Just wanted to go home.
Tom, what do I do now?
Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.
Do you owe markers?
Maybe two, three thousand dollars.
Our mistake.  But what does it matter; it was our money.  We don't even expect thanks.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
Is he related to the witness?
He is, I believe, a brother.
This committee owes an apology!
The committee is adjourned until further notice.
Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.
Yes, Michael.
Sleeping inside me.
Does it feel like a boy?
Yes, Michael, it does.
Goodbye, Michael.
You haven't heard me.
Who's asking?
Where can we talk?
You said you were Klingman.
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
There are still things I have to do.
No, I meant lose his family.
Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
Of course you must keep control of your family.
It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
Except the President of the United States.
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
So, that occurred to me.
Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.
How is his health?
Not good.
When do we talk?
After dinner.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
Says who?
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
He did business...but he never trusted him.
Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
Trust me; do as I ask.
Good.
All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.
It's important.
No, she's here.
Sitting right behind you.
We worked it all out beforehand.
Are we going to eat or what?
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
Don't I look like I'm listening?
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
What if I say shove it?
We got no choice.
What about Michael Corleone?
He supports me.
Maybe, yes... maybe no.
Eh...  Five dollars more.
In fact, reduced, bu five dollars!
I won't keep you another minute...
Just thinking out loud.
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
Weird.
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
I didn't mean to...
Sure.  I loved it.
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
The Master is waiting for you.
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
I'm not married.
A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
Of course.  I am married still.
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
He is dead now, twenty years.
Then you're as single as I am.
Yes!  You know?
You did not know?
Well...no, not really --
Yes.  I trust you.
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
What do I do?
I put him to bed.  He's not there?
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
But I didn't do this!
Mornin'.
And your name is --?
Boone.  Clayton Boone.
The Marines.  Good for you.  You must have served in Korea.
No.  Iced tea's fine.
Splendid.
What?  Oh yes.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
Nothing serious.  A touch of stroke.
You mean, like posed for pictures?
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
What's to sketch?
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
Football in college.
You went to university?
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone.  I can assure you of that.
Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.
"Bride of Frankenstein."
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
But it's just my face you want to draw.
That's exactly what I intend to do.
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
Go ahead.
I liked it.  We all did.
Did anyone laugh?
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
I don't like to talk about that.
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
All righty.  I understand.
No.  At least not in the legal sense.
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
I never thought you were.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
What way might that be?
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
Of course.  I don't want to scare you off.  Not before I'm finished with you.
Why not?
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
Oh no.  I never swim.
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
Everybody has stories to tell.
Not me.
I told you.  I don't like to talk about that.
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
I was an officer.
Of course I remember.  Do you think I'm so senile --
Do I look okay?
Nothing would please me more.
I don't hear anything.
Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
David produced her last picture.
Neither of us really belongs here.
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
Monsters?  The only monsters...  ...are here.
Can't you see?  It's raining!
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.  I believe I promised you some clothes.
You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
Very sporting of you, Clayton.
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
But you said --
That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
James Whale.  This afternoon at the party.
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
Your friend?
You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.
What won't do?
What did you expect?  Bronze?
Don't move.
There are straps in back.
It's too tight.
Oh Clayton.
Did I hurt you?
Nothing I didn't deserve.
Need some help?
Pray you, undo this button.
All right.
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
Fuck off!
You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
I think I'll hang around.
Have a drink?
I just want to watch it, okay?
The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that?
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
You remember how a production eats up one's life.
I was, until last night.  Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for today's reception.
You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
No.  I never could.  You must regret having had the invitation sent.
Then who did?
Boris?  Do I look a fright?
Elsa?
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Don't be daft.  It's just a student from the university.
Yes?
Just go.  We can manage without you.
Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black.
She is beautiful.
I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
Good night.
Of course.  This afternoon.
A visitor.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
No.  But someone you can talk to.
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
Of course.  How is the old boy these days?
It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
I know.  People's movies aren't their lives.
Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
After you then.
Everything.  Start at the beginning.
Your father was a schoolmaster?
No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
Quite.
Then the rumors are true?
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Will you tell me everything you remember about making "Frankenstein"?
Righto.  Let me see.
I just need to -- lie down. Studio.  Daybed in studio.
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
Don't go away.
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
Splendid.  Now that I know you're around.
Is there someplace we can talk?
Six years ...
A boost. A big boost ...
A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
Who do you think?
The business has changed...
I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
No, but you dress like an asshole ...
Me, too. Every time I walk...
Yes ... Kip ...
I don't want him hurt...
Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
I knew you'd say that.
I'm just here about my brother.
I knew you'd say that, too --
Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
Look at this. A multi-generational gathering of scumbags ...
One more night --
Get out --
But I had to. It was the only way to get to you --
What do you mean -- ?
You know my back -
You want to come along quiet?
How's Atley -- ?
You'll leave -- ?
You know my back.
I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
You know my back.
What are you still doing here, Randall?
Your girl works in there ...
Not my girl anymore
What do you want from me?
You know my back.
I'll catch you later, Randall --
Double-meaning intended --
You betcha --
Cadillac.
Needs brightening ...
Double-meaning intended, right?
Right ...
The other day....
Not at all ...
Keys were in it ...
Well, that defies the point, don't it?
It's all microchips and shit ...
Yeah?
We're partners here --
Donny-nothin'!
Hey, Donny --
Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business
Peugot convertible ...
Gray.
Jonathan Quayle Higgins ...

It's arright ...
Yeah...

That's being obscurest ... Who else? Better known. Memphis?
That's a good one, Donny...
I think so too --
Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
No ... And they won't take my calls ...
What does that mean -- ?
Remember who my brother is?
Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a gimme ...
What are you doing back?
How's Kip?
No.
oh.
Atley Jackson. How is that one? How's the leg... ?
Of course ...
Tuesdays ...
Every day. I wonder about that every day...
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.
I know, sir ...
Yes, sir -
You guys are through...
What do you say, Toby?,
I'm cool -
Yeah... You want a ride...
Sure -
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
Don't go there, Toby --
I dunno ...
Just hold on... Hold on ...
Hello, Memphis --
Yeah ...
You all right -- ?
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
Yeah, man. Where is your beer?
Something like that -
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
Okay --
What do you got ... ?
About what?
"About what?"
He's gonna kill you -- !
I can handle it --
I can handle it --
You can handle it?
I can handle it --
You?
Me.
You?
Me...
Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
Otto called -
Shadow games ...
How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
De nada ...
The family that steals together, deals together...
Dad'd be proud --
What era was that -- ?
The era when crime didn't pay --
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
Price of doing business...
I'm cool.
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
That's a good attitude, Kip. For everything but stealing cars ...
What?
What?
Come here -
I know. I've missed you, too
I know ...
Toby...
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
Thought I'd go for a ride -
No problem -
What for -- ?
Now, we go -
Run it...
Hospital.
We can't do that, dude --
Hell, yeah. Ten larger man
Yeah. He's knows of one all right.
Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
We're going shopping -- !
For real?
Call 'em here -- ?
DO IT! NOW -- !
The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
Buy you a drink?
Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.
Mitch.
On account of me.
I left town. I didn't leave you.
A distinction worth noting ...
And here I am...
Six or seven...
What's wrong with her -- ?
That's what I want ...
Okay.
I always thought you'd follow me up.
No ...
Oh, yeah.
Her parole officer strongly recommended it ...
I take out my slim-jim...
You're going high-cheese, dude --
"Unlock my button" ... ?
The alarms go off ...
Woo-woo-wooooo!
They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
Cut 'em...
Of course you are. You're a professional...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
Hear you roar ...
What about The Club ... ?
No worries ...
How is he -- ?
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
Bench seats.
You remember Junie?
Are you considering a comeback tour?
Tell me...
Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh...
No we don't -
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
What happened to Sway?
She left...
Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
Yeah, I'm cool ...
Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
She soars -
No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
Not really -
Excuse me --
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --
Checkin' it out
Shit all looks the same here --
What? What happened?
No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
Billy, how are you?
Son of a bitch. Get over here.
What?
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
No. No. The guy from downtown.
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
Anybody!  You understand?
I understand.
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
You treated me like shit.
They don't feel like you're in construction.
What are you gonna do?
Get inside!
The bag with the envelopes.
How much?
What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.
What are you talking about?
Let her carry this shit inside.
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
Just get me out.
What are you talking about?
I flushed it down the toilet.
You what?
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
I got seared.
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
I got scared.
Yeah. What about the kids' school?
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
We only have to shove'em over the moat.
I gotta talk to you.
Have a drink first.
There are cops all over the place.
So what?  Where are they gonna go?
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
I better call again.
Done.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
Will you stop.
He heard.
I can't make any more deliveries.
My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.
They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
Keep him here. I'm going for a bag.
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.
So do I.
Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?
He's okay. They sobered him up.
Did he say what they're asking him about?
He's with his friends.
What kind of person doesn't call?
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
Look. He's got the whole house in an uproar.
We'll pick it up.
Please?
That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.
Suck my cock!
Oh, Morgan!
All right, then.
Oh great, tell her that! Now she really thinks we're problem drinkers!
Stop crowdin the plate!
We're not goin'.  I don't even like "Kelly's."
Jesus Christ. Not even close.
No, and we got four of 'em.
I don't know yet.
Next week.
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
You're fuckin' good.
No one. I didn't have the number.
I don't know.
What do I look like, Al Cowlins?  You want to take my car, drop her off?
Gone.
What?
Some shows are worth the price of admission, partner.
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
It's a way outta here.
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
No, I had to talk him down.
Why didn't you yoke him?
Ah, history I think.
Oh...
How you doin'?
Good.
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
This is your house, right?
Yeah, it is.
You could put a pool in that backyard.
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
How much money you got?
I told you, I just got change.
I think you should establish a good line of credit.
Shut up.
I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'.
Yah, that was different. Management was restructurin'--
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
I don't have a VCR at my house.
Shut the fuck up.
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
I have about seventy-three...
Will you take a check?
How'd you like that course?
Good, it was all right.
And what do you see?
Somethin's in my room.
It's touching me.
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
You don't have to be nervous, Will.
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
Yeah, can I help you?
Building two.
Well, he didn't show up for work today...
What're you doing?
I'm sorry.
Well... I'll be speaking to your supervisor.
Fuck do you want?
Yes. Under two conditions.
What're those?
It's an integer proof.
I happen to know so.
Half-red, half-black--
--that?--
--Half-red, half-black--
--That edge!
C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
I don't know what it's called.
It's right.  Take it home with you.
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
Yes.
Who proved the theorem.
Pleasure to meet you.
You've heard of Albert Einstein?
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
So who won the bet?
Good to see you.
I've been busy.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
I got your card.
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
My kind of background?
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
Just meet with the boy once a week.
Can we do it at my office?
That would be fine.
It's on the college.
Tom.
You too, Gerry.
Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
Not at all.
I live right around the corner.
You moved?
I been here a couple years.
I think so.
What don't I understand?
Now wait a minute, Gerry--
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
--Gerry--
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
Come in.
Sean...
Me too.
I don't know. India maybe.
Why there?
Never been.
You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
Sounds good.
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
What do you want to do?
There is somebody...
Who is he?
He was my roommate in college.
You guys are fuckin' sick.
Let's hit "Kelly's."
I don't got a crush on her.
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
Had one, now I'm fucked again.
I go places, I interact.
What places?
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
What did you think?
Yeah, it did take me a long time.
You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
Oh.
No.
Crayons?
Tell me what you really think.
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
--Well, maybe that means you.
Maybe what mea--
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
Watch your mouth.
Yeah, I went on a date last week.
Fine.
I don't know.
Haven't called her.
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
My wife's dead.
Hence, the word remarried.
My wife's dead.
Why not?
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?
You're kiddin' me.
Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
Gerry says the meeting went well.
I guess.
What did you think?
What did I think?
What?
Define that.
Not to me, they're not.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
Don't give me you line of shit.
I didn't want the job.
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
--No, have you had any experience with that?
It sure ain't good.
I used to go with the wrench.
The wrench, why?
Cause fuck him, that's why.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
Don't fuck with me.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not...
Yeah, I think so.
Good for you. Congratulations.
Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
We're done. You did your time. You're a free man.
You're Welcome, Will.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
Only if you grab my ass.
Good luck.
Here's my number.
What?
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
So you just want to use me and go?
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
Yes you were.
Then why don't we just get it out of the way.
Not far from here, South Boston.
How was that?
Pretty boring, I guess.
You know, nothing special.
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
I swear to God.
Your house must have been a zoo.
'Course I do, they're my brothers.
I'm sorry, I been real busy.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
How the hell did you do that?
I've never seen your place.
Exactly.
I think I can make it to South Boston.
Fine.
Just for fun?
I guess so.
Come one Will. I just want to know.
--When it came to stuff like that I could always just play.
No.
Come with me to California.
What?
How do you know that?
I know. I just do.
Yeah, but how do you know?
I don't know. I just feel it.
And you're sure about that?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
What about your twelve brothers?
No, you don't want to hear that.
Goodbye.
Well, I'm contracting the land.
I never knowed they was anything like her!
Let 'er go, Gallagher!
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
I'll get Rosasharn.
Don't hold me so tight.
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
You're *ticklin' me!*
Now I can't breathe.
Naw. They paroled me.
Oh.
People done it. If they could, we could.
Lots must a died, too.
Well, we ain't out a it yet.
Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.
Fan-belt's shot.
Gallon or two?
She got to make it.
Short fella. Pale face.
Okay. Go on.
What's it to you?
Them was nickel apiece candy.
Sure, but what is this?
That's not your affair. Name.
Joad.
Four.
Women?
Two.
Kids?
Two.
Can all of you work?
Why, I guess so.
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
Two and a half cents.
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
An' you say no cops?
No cop can come in here without a warrant.
Government.
*You* find out, I can't.
Yeah. On my way home now.
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
Why, you're the preacher!
I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
I been in the penitentiary for four years. 
Excuse me for asking.
Shore it is. It always is, this time a year.
Just around that next bend.
No. They wasn't people to write.
All right, you remember the *man* then.
What you figger to do?
Casy! What you doin' here?
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
Thought you was in jail.
But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
Lissen, I heard that before--

*Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
Can't you see that sticker?
Yeah.
Get to what?
I stay in my own yard.
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
I didn't mean nothing.
That's where I get off.
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
Sure. We made a buck since midday.
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
Didn' you have no breakfast?
Take her with you!
And can't nobody *make* me go, either! Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me! I'm a-stayin'.
California.
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
Got any plants?
No plants.
Sure. We aim to.
Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
But will it--hurt the baby?
This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.
No'm.
Stand by the door.
She'll be awright.
Sometimes they do.
Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son 
I'm ready.
That's right. And douse some in it.
Ya say we're acrost?
Look, Ma!
Didn' you get no sleep?
No.
Granma's dead.
When?
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
They know he got hit in the face.
Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
Good-by, Tommy.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
Go ahead--Bert says take it.
There, them stripy ones.
Well, give me two then, ma'am.
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
They gone.
That's what I asked you, ain't it?
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
It ain't nobody. It's a company.
Why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when I went up.
California, here we come!
We gonna stay, ain't we?
You're tootin' we're gonna stay. 
We gonna take whatever they got.
But what about this?
I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off.
Maybe he'll be back. We'll leave word for him. Jus' don't cry.

Morning.
You people looking for work?
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
Can you pick peaches?
We can pick anything.
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
You ain't to hurt them fellas.
Yes I do.
In the corporate offices.
Oh... really?
Yeah...
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
It's what I do.
You're so funny...
I'm Martin Blank.
Don't say that.
What?
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
Computer guy.
What?
Fine, Bob. How are you?
Never better.
Really?
What do you want to do?
I want to be an actor.
Then express yourself, Bob.
It's nice to see you again.
Not much else.
What's your business?
I'm a professional killer.
Professional killer. Do you get dental with that?
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
You see someone?
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
Yep.
Well, there's not much to tell.
You met people.
Bad people.
Watched television?
Bad television.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
Unbelievable.
Seven it is.
I'll think about it.
Yes.
As long as I get the laugh.
Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
What?
Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
Like love?
Not the other way around...?
No.
Is it something you've done?
It's something I do...
Get the fuck outta here.
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
You never could have kept this from me.
That's probably a good idea.
Will you come with me?
I'm staying here.
I'll hide.
Tell me about your vision of the reunion.
I just know.
Say more.
Mmm.
Morality.
Out Loud?
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
It's only natural....
Like a club. Work less, make more.
Thank you, no.
A little misunderstanding among my associates.
Excellent. Here they come.
Hello Martin. How have you been?
Not bad. You?
That sounds pretty interesting...
Those all seem kind of related...
Nope.
In Portugal, yes.
I don't think so.
It was the PLO.
Whatever.
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
One cannot love and kill.
I love. I kill.
Patch him through....
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
That's going to cost.
I'll pay.
I'm not happy.
They blame you for the compromise.
And they want me to make up for it.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.
Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one.
Never enough.
I'll do it tomorrow.
It's fine.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
I've looked at it.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
That's wonderful, Mom.
What's a revival tent?
It's a place where religious people--
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
Jim?
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
Nature made him then broke the mold.
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
I have a headache. You have a headache?
No, I don't have one.
You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
Yeah. I guess we did.
Of course you will.
I have always thought about her and missed her.
Paul?
You're leaving me hanging here...
You too.
No. You drove us here.
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
He sold me this bad boy.
Mein Dealer.
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
As long as you had a good time.
That's too bad.
See you in ten years.
How did you get this job?
How are you? How's business?
That's good.
I am very sorry, ma'am. Goodbye now.
You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
It is cocktail hour yet?
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
You lived in Chicago?
When I was first married.
You were married to a woman in Chicago?
Just who's been laughing at who here?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
You too.
Need a lift?
I can handle it!
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
Feel good?
Yeah.
Huh?
Tom.
Ssshhh...  Stand still, Annie. Takes what we've got, just for now. Can you do that?
Annie!
One more time.
How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
I brought it to you in the hospital.
What about him?
Yeah?
Whatever you want.
Fine!
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
I didn't know I had to.
You don't.
I don't care.
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
Then why do you want to leave?
Little.
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
You already did.
Did he mention it?
No. I just thought... forget it.
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
I'll take care of it.
Thanks, honey.
Did you go riding?
Well...  So you tried riding again?
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
I said... I started.
My period.
When? Tonight?
What?... Oh baby...
Why should they?
So do you.
How's everything?
Good.
Hi.
Go ahead...
Who's there?
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
Did you speak to Farlow?
Yes. We're suing.
All right. Speak to you then.
Hi.
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
Sure... What's Grace up to?
Riding with Judith.
Yeah. Bye.
Tch. What are you --
Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
No, let me go.
The funeral's on Friday.
Oh. Right. I'll call him.
How's my pregnant chick!
I love you.
Do you? Do you really?
Doing what?
No.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
She will if you think she should.
And you think it's best if I don't come.
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
I know. We miss you too.
Night.
Huh-huh. You?
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
Let's not talk about that now.
Yeah, what?
Take your time.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
You want to take a walk with me?
We have a business manager. The best around.
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
What choice!!?
Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah.
Yes, it does.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list.
You too, Diane.
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
- See, what you can do for him --...
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?
There's a kid at school says we should've imprint-trained him.
Weekend after next...
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
Because it fits my head. You want to try it on?
Have you talked to Tom about it?
Of course I have.
You know, you're a good kid.
Mmm. An editor.
You're catching on.
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
I don't have all day.
Well, there's only one way to find out.  Give it a little gas.
There's no hurry. Take you time.
Sure.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
You want to go to a movie tonight?
I thought your mom's coming up?
I just could never say it!
Why don't we just cut through the woods?
No, not yet.
How's Pilgrim doing?
OK, OK.
Maybe... look -- just...
I want to see Pilgrim.
I know. Amazing.
Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom?
YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
You just showing off for her!
You shut up, stupid!
How much longer do you think?
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
How long were you married?
Long enough.
You ever miss it?
Does a horse miss a saddle?
Where did you learn all this stuff?
Cool?
You think it's cool?
It's cool!
Don't move!
Hack the Planet!
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait!
Waste the dude.
Devil book. The Unix Bible.
Dragon book. Compiler design.
Shh!
Was that her top?
The sensitive type.
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Looks like a hacker wrote it.
Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!
Yo, brain dead, the manual!
...as they snoop onto us.
It was him, man!
Do you think he could hack a Gibson?
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Difficulty rating?
Yeah?
Go fix the phones.
Roger.
Curtis.
And what's he do?
Dead?
Yeah, mom?
What are you doing?
Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy birthday.
Up all night again, huh?
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!
Hmmm.
No. No one special.
Nah. I don't play well with others.
Thank you!
I told you, I don't play well with others.
Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a file.
Give it up! Just give it up.
This is the end, my friend.  Thank you for calling!
Razor and Blade.
I got photographic memory.  It's a curse!  Lisa!
What's this one eat?
It nibbles. You see this?
Joey's getting stupid busy.
We did it!
No, you're not in my class.
I'll give it a shot.
Pool on the roof must have a leak.
I said give me time.
He's not enrolled in this class.
I'm Crash Override.
It's cool, I'm just looking.
It's too much machine for you.
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Yeah. RISC is good.
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
Are you challenging me?
If I win, you become my slave.
Make it my first born.
Make it our first date.
And you have to smile.
Okay. I'll copy it.
Okay, thank you.
Uh, hold on...
I have to tell you something.
I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
I'll make it up to you!
I'll hack the Gibson.
It's my subway defense system.
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
They're elite! Let's get 'em.
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
Yeah.
Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
I'm trying to help you.
What?
Yeah.
Wanna go for a swim?
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
I think we've got something.
We caught 'em.
Good.
Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?
My name is the Plague.
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
Let's echo 23, see what's up.
Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!
Joey, Joey...
What? whatwhatwhat?
You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
Love, secret, and uh, sex.  But not in that order, necessarily, right?
Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
Hey, it's me.
Phreak?
Virus?
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
Sh, sh sh sh sh.
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me.
Nonono, thank YOU!
555-4202.
Just one moment.
Thank you.
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
I'll take you down there.
All right.
Okay sure. What about?
Its about tonight.
My parents baby-sitter canceled.
So?
When did you find this out?
This morning.
I'm not angry it's just
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
I don't know Brady.
Okay, I guess. I'll call you later.
You don't owe me anything.
No, you don't understand.
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
We've been better.
What's going on?
Michael Myers.
Who's that?
10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
Look.
She's not dead!
I don't know!
What does that mean?
We're trapped in this house.
Brady! Come with us.
Brady!
Get up there Rachel!
Get up there Rachel!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
Go!
Yes, sir.
Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
Its too late.
You guys always look great.
I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.
How do you know their not?
Because the lights are all out.
About what?
How many people in the bus?
Four plus Myers.
How many bodies did you find?
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
Has he been prepped?
Outside.
Yeah.  Well I guess your happy to see him go.
Drive Carefully.
Okay, out.
I can't sleep.
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
Jamie, sometimes it's...
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
In a second.
It was the nightmare man
Coming.
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
This is great Rachel. Come on.
Forget it kido. We're home by eight o'clock.
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
Oh Rachel!
No.
Come on.
Well try dammit!
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
Then we'll be safe?
Yeah.
Just do it.
Hi.
You knew. You just didn't care.
Hi Jamie.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
I don't want to look pushy.
You won't look pushy.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Its not over yet.
Where are you going?
You look sharp. You understand?
No problem, Sheriff.
This is 132, over.
Go get it.
What are we doing?
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
If you'd seen that police station you wouldn't even ask.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
He's here, Sheriff.
Why?
He's been here.
How do you know?
Least I'm not alone.
Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
Be here in a minute.
They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.
Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah
Car trouble?
Sort of.
What's going on?
Now you understand?
Uh huh.
Don't touch him Jamie!
Hi, Dad. What happened?
What?
What happened?
You blame everything on kids.
He shouts, too.
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
That's not true. Here I am.
We just talked.
Sure.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
Fun-ny. See you.
I forgot my chemistry book.
Look where?
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
Of course.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
Bye.
I wasn't spooked.
He was watching me.
That's probably all he can do.
You guys will make a fabulous couple.
I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
I want to stay here and watch this.
Come with me.
And I can't keep you interested?
Yeah.
Want a beer?
Yeah.
Is that all you say?
Yeah.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
Are you sure?
Michael's around someplace...
Will you call me tomorrow?
Yeah, sure.
Promise?
Yeah.
Lee Brackett.
I'll be here.
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
You all right?
I found the car! He's here!
I don't think so...
Have a good time.
Hi, Tommy.
Same time, same place.
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
Just watch.
Why are they under there?
Mom doesn't like me to have them.
After the movie.
What about the bogyman?
There is no such thing.
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
There was no one outside.
There WAS.
What did he look like?
The bogyman!
I promise.
Tommy, let me in!
What is it, Laurie?
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
It's the bogyman, isn't it?
HURRY!
Yes.
How?
I killed him...
But you can't kill the bogyman.
Will you get her for me?
She's washing her clothes.
Of course not.
I've given them his profile.
There's nothing else I can do.
I'm wasting time.
Thorazin.
That's the idea. Here we are.
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
Only minimum security.
I see.
What does that mean?
It means... I see.
Shouldn't we pick him up?
Move it!
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."
Come in, come in.
I can't believe it!
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's.  I do the, uh, crpes caviar.
Oh.
Are you really interested?
Yeah.
You want to see some?
Oh, yeah.
Well, let's do it.
Great.
Look at this.
A lot of works.
Uh --
And then, uh, April...huh?
Great.
I mean, I've looked everywhere.
No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
Oh, it's magnificent!
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
It's really terrible.
Okay.
Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
I mean, it's jammed.  If we went... um...
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
No, he called late last night.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
And you, you-you're going?
No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.
Hmm?
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
Is this your first job?
Really?  Is the food that bad?
Oh no.  Not at all.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
I'm an architect.
It's terrific!
And it ruins everything else.
It does.
Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
This time I really think I have something.
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
Let's take a look.
When did you first notice this?
It's nothing.  Will you trust me?
Yeah.  It's kind of a weird place, actually.  A lotta wall space. 
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Hi.
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
Ed Smythe, yes.
Could you--
...with the affiliates.
Yes, but you name names.
...cannot go on the air.
I don't know exactly.
Oh, Elliot!
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Oh, what, in this section of town?
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
You're out looking here?
How about you?
Oh.  Well, I live--
Where are you headed?
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
Yeah, you would.
Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
No?
Uh, yes!
Yes?
Everything's okay? 
I'm...all right.
How-how's Frederick?
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
Oh, that's nice.  I'd love to see her wind up settled.  She's a tense one. 
Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
What are you doing?!
Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
Why, you know the situation.
What do you expect me to say?
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
But not over me?
Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
I almost didn't.
Lee... uh...
I didn't sleep all night.
No, no-no-no, I'm sure.
I know it isn't.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
Is something wrong?
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
I care a great deal about him, yes.
Aren't they great?
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
I know!  I know!
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
I know.
That's where your talent lies.
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
I want one with you.
No!
Are you in love with someone else?
My God!  Wha-what is this?  The Gestapo?  No.
Get his wine away.
I am glad to see you.
Always.
Oh, honey!
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
So?
That thought doesn't terrify you?
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!
How do you know?
Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
No, thank you.
No, nothing.
Absolutely.
Hmm?
Me?
Yeah.
Based on what?  You never even see him.
They're in the basement.
I can't take this anymore.
Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!
Because I have to!
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
Oh, yes, you have!
No.
Stop accusing me!
I'm sorry.
So you met somebody else?
Yeah.
But who?  Where did you meet him?
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
You know... 
Yeah?
Like-- 
I can't keep my mind on the show.
But there's nothing wrong with you.
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything...
You've outdone yourself.
You look so beautiful.
Come on.
Doesn't she look pretty?
I bumped into your...
Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
Oh, me, I'm okay.
Do you miss Frederick?
No.
I'm okay.
Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
Oh, now-- 
Yeah.  I'll get some ice.
I know...I know.
Glad you could put in an appearance.
Very good.
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
Here, you guys.  Open them up.
Yeah?
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
...you know?  I, uh...
You know, he's been wanting a mitt.
Mh-hm.
Isn't that great?
Go right over there.
Is there no chance?
Well, then a third opinion.
Hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies?  Jesus!
What are you talking about?
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
Just think about it.  That's all I ask.
...from Mavis, also.
He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
No, no, we decided!
This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts.
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
I know.  H-how much do you need?
Uh-oh.
She really does, though.
When does Frederick ever come with her?
Oh, your kids are so adorable.
It's, uh, you never know--
He's such a loser!
He's not a loser at all!
Oh, he's such a loser!
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Here.  Be careful with those.
Oh!
Oooo.
Yeah, can you believe it?
Really?
No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
I know, no--  I know.
Easily.
I hope.
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
Tch, well, I sing!  For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!
So what's new?
You got it.
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
I'm real upset about what you wrote.
Oh, so loosely.
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy!  The room's alive with positive vibrations!
You want some?
No!
My--uh...
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
God!
Yes, you do recall, right?
I recall you.
Good.  How are you?
I'm fine.
You look wonderful.
Oh, no.
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
It was a terrible evening.
...in a really horrible way.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
Well, I hope you've changed.
I'm okay.
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
Well...
Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?
Yeah.
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
No, you can tell me.
Come on.
No, I am.  I am.
Really?
You've always hated my taste in the past.
You have.
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
Oh, well.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Hi.  How you doin'?
Okay.
When'd you get here?
Just a few minutes ago.
Oh.  You look so beautiful.
Mmm, what?
I'm pregnant.
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
Oh...
Dad!
...which I did not get.
Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
Uh-huh.
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?
...you don't have to think.
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
I'm going to tell you later....
A reward for what?
Some museum director disappeared.
And?
They're offering... 
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
I <u>swear</u> to you...
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
I hereby acknowledge that...
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?
It wasn't my day.
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
...how are things at the Hospital?
It's a growth business.
What have they got you doing?
Yes, I presumed it was about him.
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think he'd come after <u>you</u>...?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
That would adversely impact my income.
Say it in English.
...aren't you afraid of me...?
You want me to be?
I'd prefer it...  But it's just a vacant exercise.
Oh, Good.  The ornithological leitmotif...
Rich, comic book freaks.
And why is it a vacant exercise?
Who would that be.
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
All y'got to do is <u>ask</u>... 
I'm not.
That's what <u>you</u> think...
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
...the whole world's out to get you...
How crazy is that.
M'I gonna see you tonight?
That's right.
What's new onna street?
All Quiet Along the Potomac...
...these guy'll back you up.
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
What's up...?
Their family owns...
Impossible.
...what a world.
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
First things first.
You take this much time over everything?
That's why my wife adores me.
Not with any certainty we...
Why did he come back?
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
...Let's see the pigs, please.
Somewhere in Italy.
Have the child taken to bed.
OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
No.  And...
I like Popcorn...
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
You give me whatever I want...?
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
...they're from Baltimore....
I've never heard that he...
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
Exactly.
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
Try Barney Clark.
And how would you know that?
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
No, no, of course not.
Tell him to give it to an orphanage.
...here's to child abuse!
Mmm...
Yes, I did.
....what...? 
Let the girl go.
Why?
'fraid it's too late.
Shut up, Starling...
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
 He once made me an improper suggestion.
You seen John Brigham...?
A fellow with five fingers.
...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
What is that supposed to mean...?
I think its meaning is clear.
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
That could be.
I'm an orphan.
What'd you say, hon...?
I said sometime it gets so...
How's your <u>child</u>?
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
Waal...
'bout time you <u>learned</u>...
You know it?
I have had many excellent meals there.
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
...should love to correct your error. 
That, that was <u>business</u>...
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
I'll have them picked up.
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
My scar is a war-wound.
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
The commissioner is going round the Cafe...
Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?
...yes, yes, yes...
Yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. I won't be a minute...
Where do you live?
With Mama and Shirley and Stringbean.
Yes.... yes...
Sir, with all due respect....
Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
I realize, you're under a lot of....
Let's get her <u>out</u> of here....
<u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
What is that that smells so wonderful.
Indeed we were.
...and my need for The Institution...
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
And how did he do that?
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
...you have to <u>eat</u>...
...but will that satisfy you?
Why should <u>you</u> care?
<u>Yes</u>.
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
...which of us is free...?
No, that is code-word material, that's what <u>that</u> is....
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
Yeah, but who would marry friendless <u>me</u>...  Howabout you, Romeo...?
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
...what?
N'not <u>that</u> sad.
Every suicide kills two.
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
What would you guess, Ardelia?
You goin to shoot yourself? 
Don't shoot yourself.
Why?
...<u>what</u>...?
They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
...and that is what you need to expand.
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
Because it is exclusive... because <u>everyone</u> will be here...
Then we cannot go.
Because...?
....because we don't have any mmm...
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
...what did you want? 
I know where he is.
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
I know where he is.
And why should we believe you?
I want the money.
What shape is the scar?
The shape of a Three.
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
Hey, lost again.
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
Or clear your windshield with it.
...what a lovely perfume.
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
It would seem.
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
...I feel that...
"A liaison position with the Opera." 
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but... 
What does <u>that</u> mean?
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
...would you use a small word?
For approval.
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
...yes...?
You want some <u>advice</u>.
Yes.
That's when you went to the Orphanage...
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
I can be a good pig. Babe. Charlotte's Web. Good pig. Watch.
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
Did you wait until you were 18?
I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
I'm not really a--Does it count if...
Everything.
What are you gonna do about it?
Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.
Your Secret admirer?
Goodnight.
That wants to be a Yes.
Nothing.
Why do you even like me?
Uh-huh.
The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.
Clever observation. Go back to Wichita.  Oh that's right, you can't.
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
That's not what I was worried about.
Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
Yeah. I guess I do.
Talia's a rock. She'll be fine...
I think your condescension is even better.
You know, this reminds me of the time we were talking about something and then just started kissing...
It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
Talking while kissing.
Do you really think I care?
Something more interesting than that...How could you?  How could--!
Thank you, my love.                                         ]
Betty Finn. Gosh.....
Shoot.
Nice guys finish last. I should know.
Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
Hey, don't run away now.
Let's do it on the coats. It'll be excellent.
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
You did last night.
All right.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Oh yeah, that's it.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Oh yeah, that's it.
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
Uh-huh.
Don't think.
Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?
Come on you jerk. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
You goddamn bitch!
Did we? How the hell'd you get in here?
I made your favorite. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
Color me nauseous.
He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.
Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
Yeah, maybe.
Heather.
Jealous much?
Yeah, I just got back.
Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
Give it up girl!
Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
Uh-huh.
Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
If everyone jumped off a bridge, young lady, would you?
Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University.
I don't really like your friends either.
S'okay....
Killing her won't solve anything.
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.
Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
You're not funny.
No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own.
That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
That's good. Have you done this before?
Next channel, darling.
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.
French.
Of course.
Did to.
Did not.
Did to.
Did not.
I was just making it more special.
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
You kids are making too much damn noise.
Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you.
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
This knife is filthy.
No-o!
I thought I...you..
Let's kick his ass.
Cool off, we're seniors.
Goddamn Geek!
I think so, man.
Any contestants worth mentioning?
Superb.
But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
I work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.

Come on through.

Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.

I'm not hungry.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
But she'll have no one to look after her!
Can I go now?
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
What does old Stew want?
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
You have to let me go!

Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.
hurries over.
gives her a sympathetic look.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
Mummy!
Somebody's got to help us!
It doesn't matter.
Of course it matters! It's Mario!
Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
He . . .
Him . . .
This . . .
That . . .
It's so beautiful!
What???
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
What??
That idiot boarder?
Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
You mean travel by ourselves?
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
That was what we were led to believe . . .
Too right . . . but he doesn't have a show! Nobody gets into Mother's draws except Daddy!
Yes . . .
Mummy!
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
No wisdom, no insight, no plan.
I miss her. I miss my wife.
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
The way you just looked at me...
I'm stumped.
It's inside a moving car.
Bull...
Second most common?
Skin cancer.
Eighty third most common.
Pitbull attacks.
You just made that up.
I did more then that.
Well?
Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
What?
Getting paid for doing shit.
I have my connections
Really? Do tell.
Gwen.
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
I quit. Today's my last day.
Someone special.
Have we met?
I've been in here before.
Allison Dormere. Your intern.
I said she's been missing for-
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
Zero's a number right?
Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
What?
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
Eighty four.
But... I thought...
I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?
Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan 
I only married you for your body.
For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
No please make yourself at home.
Music to my ears.
Who the hell are you talking to?
Can you follow them?
Wow you are out of it.  
You should always listen to your subconscious. It's trying to tell you something about your waking life.
I surrender...
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-
What do you mean?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
You.
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
I know a guy who only has one leg.
In private.  They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones.
The bathroom!  For two days?
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
Lighten up, John.  You think <u>you</u> got problems for Chrissake?
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.
I got your bail continued.
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
How recently?
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
Yeah, like that.  Same thing.
THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
Were you in it?  In the war?
You never saw that picture, huh?
What picture?
Thanks.  Thanks, pal.
All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
Uh, actually... yes... I... should never have come forward and presented myself as --
No, I don't have the right.  You're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!
Goodnight, John.
Read it.  It'll be fine.
You do?
I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
This guy LaPlante won an award?
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
You're sitting on your ticket.
Apparently the guy who pulled you out wasn't a passenger...
A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?
A Silver Mike!  You're covering us in glory!
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
Said he's not an actor.
She can't quit.
What?
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
I... I saw him out the window.
Dad!
Hello, Mister Wallace.
Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
You didn't... get it on with him?
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.
I didn't ask him.
Okay.
They're really white.
Whoa, check it out.
Let's watch some TV.
Where are these toys of yours?
Any particular brand?
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.
-- institution.
Oh, good -- well, I hope you'll have more to tell me next time.
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
A sense of proportion.
I should.
Maybe I could take a look at it now.
Yeah, that was easy.
Do you do washing machines, too?
Just show me the way.
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
It's a living.
Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
I think we should talk first.
About us.
I'm thirsty.
Aw, okay.
A man scared me.
A man?  Was it a dream?
Uh huh.
Did Daddy tease you?
I've asked him what's wrong.
Here, take this out to the table.
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool.
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
Stop knowing me so well.
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
But it's what we want.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
It's a nice pool, isn't it?
And it's a shorter commute.
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
Good -- that's what I was trying to project.
What?
Honey, are you okay?
Huh?
Oh -- great.
<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
There's no card or anything.
All new houses have noises.
What next?!  -- A strange bra under my pillow!
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Philip!  The senior partner?
His secretary just confirmed.
Oh baby.
What?
There might be some extras in the garage.
Someone blew the whistle.  Someone hates me.
"Honey, I'm a zombie, I don't know whether I'm coming or going."
I'm having the floor fixed,
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
Look, I think we should work things out.
I think it's time I came home now.
That's not a decision for you to make on your own.
We'll talk in the morning.
Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
How large is your brood?
Two -- three if you count the husband.
Shut up.
What for, dickweed?
It's fun.
Grow up, Dreyer.
Put it out, man!
Do you have enough money?
Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!
What did the thermometer say?
The thermometer's broken.
Can we keep him?
Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
No.
Get on the other side of that.
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
Right over here.
It's a double.
Even better.
Promise.
Would you?
Uh huh.
Really.
Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
Not now.  I'm busy.
They appear to be authentic.
Yes.
Yeah -- how'd you know that?
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
This ties in with Nash.
I think it was England.
Why?
What?
Lieutenant.
Congratulations.
A few days ago.
I already told you.  I took a walk.
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
Central Park.
Where have you been for the last seven years?
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
Get outta here.
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
What?
Sing.
That's all?
Yes.
Leaving what?
And what do you think you will find in another land?
Then it's worth the journey.
For what?
As friends -- always as friends.
If it came down to it what would you do?
How long is the voyage?
Living.  Remember?
She's the King's cousin.
Then she should be an excellent dancer.
What worries you?
You.
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
The only thing you can do.  You must end it.
It's done.
No -- I will.
I stood up first.
That doesn't matter.
You always get to go first.
Can you really tell from doing that?
What do you think?
I think you just like to eat dirt.
She's a treasure she is.
She'll soon be of age.
Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
How?
I lied.
Sometimes.
Because it's the past -- and things that are in the past are best left there.
Why not?
I'm leaving in the morning.
I cannot explain.
Do you love me, Conner?
Aye.
Then take me with you.
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
Why are you doing this?
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
What do you want?
To talk to you.
A lucky guess.
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
You got me.
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
I'll be fine.
I don't know anymore.
You remind me of someone I used to know.
Who was that man last night?
I don't know.
Then how did he know your name?
New York is dangerous place.
Have you ever heard of the Calan?
You look like you have.
Why?
You're twenty minutes late.
Sorry.
I know.
I've lived all over the world.
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
I wanted to get to know you better.
Yes -- it is.
Why don't you tell me.
Why not?
--for three hundred years.
I've seen it.
And the other one -- he is like you?
It will end tonight.
Must you fight him?
He will not stop until it is over.
I don't know.
What's that next to him?
His head.  Someone cut it off.
It has to be.
And this?
I was working on the cataloging.
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?
Perhaps -- but it comes off none the less.
That's what the Kurgan said.
How can that be?
I don't know.
Me too.
Aye -- that I would, lass.
It's not for me to decide.
Yes.
Why won't you ever let anyone help you?
What will you do?
You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.
And now it's time to come out of the shadows.
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
I think he's dead!
Don't shout, Larry.  I'm three feet away.
The mother is in Florida visiting her sister.  The father works at home, so he's probably inside.
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
Get to work.
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
I'll make the call.
I guess not.
Am I talkin' raghead?!  I want your car! <u>Gimme the goddamned keys</u>!
You won't die if you let me help.
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
What if he's dead?  What if you killed him?
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
We should give up.  All we're doing is making it worse.
You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --
Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need anti-depressants.
That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
Not if they're looking at something else.
I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
Kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
I'm not going to die for this!
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
How about the cop?
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
I got these people!  You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
I'm here.
I gotta piss real bad.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
Let me come get him.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
My father.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
I'm getting a doctor!
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
You can't run with suitcases.
I got the gasoline --
We don't have time!
They'll cut the power.
I don't eat junk food.
You fucked up, Glen.
An hour, tops.  Might be sooner.
What do you mean?
You worry about your end.  I got my side covered.
Canyon Country.
I think you got no choice.
You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
Close.
We'll see you in a couple of hours.
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
But they're not here yet.  Tell me about <u>you</u>.
I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
That's okay.  I love you anyway.
Be quiet!  Listen!
That big asshole nailed my windows.
Mine, too.
Shh, they'll hear you!
I don't drink beer.
We can't make the microwave work.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.
Mars?  What are you doing?
Whatever.
He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
He said something about a girl --
Holster your guns!
What are we going to do about Mike?
Keep your head down.
Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.
What are you doing?!  Stop that!
He.  Can't.  Answer.
I need to talk to him.  Alone.
Another minute.  Please --
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
Go, Chief.
Go, Chief.
Tell her I'm almost home.
Go.
You have her cell number?
She didn't answer.
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
That's why you get the big bucks, Captain.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
Then I think we should wait.  Do you agree?
And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house.
I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
Goddamned small town bullshit.
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
Go, Mickey.
Are all of you named Jones?
Don't be funny, Chief.  You can't afford it.
What?
Not until the man calls.
Where's the office?
We're okay.
Where are you right now?
In my room.
What do you want me to do?
Look for names.  Does it say whose taxes they are?
Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
Charles G. Benza.  They're coming!
No!  They're right here --
They're still in the house.
Yes.
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
Smith will know.
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
You don't want another dead child on your conscience.
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
A delegation.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
I'll be back.
Let me see your identity card.
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
No. I work at the Mille Collines.
Let me explain.
There is nothing to it.
Name a price.
Ten thousand francs for each one.
I don't have that much.
Six.
And four children?
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Yes we have.
What was the response?
We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
Excuse me, Colonel.
They're only taking the whites.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
I can't, I don't have the men.
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
Watch everything? How? They are gone.
Satellites?
And what will they do with these satellites?
Well rewarded Those were his words.
You said you had no whiskey.
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
Get in.
Your police are at the gate?
After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
Today.
Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
Listen, you need me.
How so.
When the Europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists.
You think they will believe you?
You will tell them the truth.
I will do nothing unless you help me now.
Business is good at the hotel?
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
You have no whiskey?
Why not? We are half way there already.
What is it?
Fuck you.
Very soon.
Thank God.
Give me the phone.
Gregoire, what are you doing here?
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
For supplies, you drive.
The fog is too heavy, sir.
Just drive, Gregoire.
I saw the sign.
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
Promoted. House Manager.
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
This goes out live?
I know that, Paul. I'm sorry.
Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
Why sir?
Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
I will remember that name.  Let's go.
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
The commander is not here.
He will be here.
Show me your ID
What?
What cards?
You have our cards.
One thousand francs.
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
Of course.
The third floor are low class rooms.
Yes, with Fedens and the children.
He wants your wisdom.
Let's have dinner first.
We must do something.
You could have asked for a favor.
Murdered! By whom?
I sent them home. Go and call them.
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
Dawn. Then they go.
Where are you hurt, son?
Stay with the children.
Get in.
Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them.
It will do just fine.
How can we help him.
No. They are not dead. Stop this.
What about us?
What are you saying, Tatsi?
What for Paul.
So where is the lamb?
Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
Tell me what it was.
A car.
What sort of car?
A Volkswagen.
A Volkswagen!
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
Please, please try one more time.
No! Sit down now.
I will follow on the next plane. Go.
Paul! Then another voice.
We are almost out of everything.
What's wrong?
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
What's wrong?
Many times.
Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi.
How dead?
He has taken the presidential suite.
What! Paul storms off.
The lieutenant wants the register.
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
Many beers.
As the trucks go.
It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
The staff, the guests.
The staff and guests! How many?
No, I don't want you going on the street.
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
Who is this Simon?
Where?
On the street.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
What is his room number?
I don't know.
Go downstairs, I will help you.
If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
It's complicated. But don't worry --
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
Oh dear.
More to the point. Where's our host?
Ms. Marr!
Is she alright?
Excuse me?
I don't know!!
If this is someone's idea of a joke --
Yeah, me too.
And I think that's case --
You sure? You'll be alright by yourself?
You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
-- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then.
Nothing.
Yes.
The...Fourth of July.
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
Poor Mr. Price --
What?
It's not going to let us out!
Me? You've gotta be kidding.
Up here --
Over here!
Take the gun.
Prove it how?
I thought she was dead. For sure.
Don't push it.
You need to get out more.
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
Why not?
An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
-- that's the fact, bud --
-- where the hell were you?
-- listen to the man --
Let's try down here...
Better living through electricity.
What about that other guy?
It'll have to do.
He's dead...?
We're safe?
For chrissake give me a hand!
Run.
What --
Jesus!
So where's the party?
Oh, I think we're going to have several.
You're hurting me.
I know.
Really? Well, let it rip.
Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.
Stalking the wild poltergeist.
-- and who's next on your list?
-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
-- thank you! All the cards finally on the goddamn table!
-- what...are...you...going...to --
Steven??
Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
You didn't think to ask?
No, no, it's just --
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
And here's your goddamn severance!
Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.
I think it's something better experienced then described.
Maybe if I --
Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
I am.
Something with the power, I don't know!!
I think I'll do what I damn well please.
I never saw you --
Well, I can't, sweetheart.
-- no more --
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Please! I need your help.
Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
Rewind that.
No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
He must've beaten us all here!
I can't comment until I get paid.
What's going on?
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
Hasn't been a telephone in this House in over 60 years.
Why not?
Excuse me?
Oh, dear.
He must've unsealed the room!
How, he's supposed to be dead!
-- ten.
Over here.
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
Keep talking, I'll find you!
Something....happened --
-- something horrible...I don't understand --
You say you saw some activity here?
Colleen.
We don't have proof of that.
What will they tell you?
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
Why don't you pass me your plate?
No!
A few years older, perhaps.
How's your arm?
I'm sorry.
There's no need to be.
By freeing them.
I don't understand.
Well I bet you they're happy.
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
I didn't do anything, mommy.
Well then who did?!
Who...is Colleen?
No it won't - no it won't!
She talks to me.
I'm scared!
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
We're going to go someplace new.
What about all my other stuff?
We'll get it later.
Go to your room!  Now!
What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
Where is she?
Where is she now?
She's hiding.
Take me to her.
My God, I heard something!
Sure.  Did you see the others?
I want this one, daddy.
He's blessing the house.
Why?
For good luck honey.
That's great, honey.
Don't be afraid!
Daddy help!
Well, that all depends.
Good night daddy.
I just, I don't know...
Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
Whatever you say.
To our family.
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
Yeah, well I'll be joining you shortly.  I just want to...
Ok.
Were you fooling with the power?
It was in the cellar.  Weird.
So what are you saying?
I don't know what I'm saying.
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
Well what do you think it is?
Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
What about keeping an open mind?
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
Are you ok?
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
A friend?
I think everything's ready.
Good.  I'll start bringing things in.
She's gone!
Aubrey!
You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
Ok...
We're not going.
What's happening!
I'm ok.
I'm all right...
She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
Maura.
You'll have to settle for turkey.
White meat will be fine...
Yes, I am.
May I come in?
Did you know her very well?
Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
Come back to us honey!
Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
Perhaps I'll see you in church.
The amulet...
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
It will not take long...
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
Not someone.  Something. I've never felt a presence that strong before.
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
Not at all, if it can help.
What?
There's something through that wall!
Well what is it!
I know what I saw.
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
Your apartment.
What happened to him?
Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
Joey.  Yeah, who is this?
Why are you so interested?
Sorry.
Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
What?
I'm trying to quit.
It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
That's what I'm trying to tell you! ...
I'll do it!
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
Every day.
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
Sure.  Why?
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
What on earth were you doing down here?
Buying some drugs, alright?
Oh, Terri ...
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
You gonna buy?
I don't know.  Maybe.
Uh-huh.
A prize?  For what?
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
Don't do that!  Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it...
No.  Thank you.
Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
But how in God's name ...
It has already begun.
Not quite.
JP?
Yeah really.  I'm ...
Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
I laughed, I cried.
Gum.
Guards come exactly every three minutes....
My next word was gonna be "consciousness."  Swear to God... tubby.
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
Sure.  That's why his meatballs are made out of marinated Chuck Wagon.
Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.
Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it.
There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
You're not...LISTENING!
"He kicks up at anything he hears.
"Every day you meet quite a few."
Geez, Gates was killed.  Who do we send the thank you note to?
But I said I was sorry....
Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
Why not just go now?
Okay.
Don't worry, we'll get it...
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
Anna, I think you better stay....
You can be lookout!.....  Take Alex's gun.
You're a reed, man.  I gotta get Anna.  Hang in there...
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Get em....
Too-do-loo, babe.
Yes way.
It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
Last rites, sister?
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
You're supposed to be dead!
Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...
Oh, you read that.
I never break a date.  Scout's honor.
I was the Warden?
How long were you in?
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
Uh....old badminton injury.
Oh, I'm so sorry...
Wha.....
Actually he never told us what it was.
Baseball, why?
Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.
I don't care.
The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
Remember that shoe you lost...
For God's sake, chain this convict.
Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
Bastard!  If you were a true American.
Just shut up and hit me!
Employer?  The president?
I'm supposed to fall for that?
Shucks.  Guess not.
Tell me about it...
The Dancing Dingus!
The Jerky Circle!
Sharp.
Snappy.
With a little jazz.
The Shazzammeter!
The Hipster!
The Circle-o'-Gaiety!
The Hudswinger!
The Hoop-dee-doo!
The Hudsucker Hoop!
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
A sawbuck!
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
I know they're gonna buy that stock --
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
Why yes, do you know it?
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
...Why don't I just type this up...
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
...You do?
You know, on farm route 17.
Oh yes! In Muncie!
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
Norville!
Huh?!
As a three-dollar bill.
Sez who?
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
It's about a dimwitted editor who --
He grins wolfishly.
Ya know, entry level!
I got big ideas, though!
I'm sure you do.
Nooo, I don't guess you will be.
Forty-eight years...
I thought you served misfits here!
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
What the heck they doin'?
This I know, Benny.
This you're familia' with.
...Geez.
It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too --
Huh?! But, buddy --
An example must be made!
Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Nah, that's all forgotten.
Say, that was a swell idea!
And Sid says you stole it!
But Buzz --
Yes sir...
Yeah?
Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
I --
Well, I'm a college graduate --
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
Well, I made the dean's list.
No, sir.
Not even behind your back?
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
But, sir! --
Get your feet off that desk.
Get out of my sight.
Oh my God, sir!
Sir, my leg is on fire!
Oh my God, sir!
Yeah, tell me about it.
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
Ya get the special?
Fah from it...
There's one in every story.
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
She's looking for her mark.
She sits down.
She looks in her purse...
The mark notices.
Maybe he's wise.
He don't look wise.
Plan two: Here come the waterworks.
Old Faithful.
Hello, Niagara.
He notices.
...adenoids.
He don't look wise.
She is!
She's damn good, Lou.
Thank you for waking me.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
At the Houmfort.
That's nonsense, Alma.
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
If you say, miss.  If you say.
I'm afraid so.
Ti-Joseph?
Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
I've never heard of a cure.
Is this disease common in the tropics?
I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
Yes.
Where were you trained?
At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.
That's rather nice, isn't it?
My brother's wife.
I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.
I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
Did you hear what he sang?
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
Yes, thank you.
A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
Of course not!
I'm sorry...
Many people thought her beautiful.
And charming?
I've never given it much thought.
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
I often do.
I imagined this so differently...
Help me? How?
I hated her.
I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
Yes.
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
Betsy, tell them about the Houmfort.  Tell them what you saw there.
Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
Right o'.
Up the organization!  Bastard.
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
In Rhode Island with the folks. I'm a free agent tonight.
No thank you. We should be off.
I wasn't star--
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
Good night.
You want to go?
What do you think?
Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
So early?
Rough day. Good night.
I do. I'm -- are you...?
I... I think I am...
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
Stuffed and baking.
You go dry off now.
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
That one.
See for yourself.
No advice from the experts, huh?
You think I --
I have no idea.
What's on your mind? Don't --
Don't be dim.
I'm not surprised.
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
If you're going to insult me --
In the car.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
That this was going to be a key party?
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
Ben.
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
We'll talk in the morning.
Yeah. Well, we can just --
Ben, I don't think he wants us here.
All right.
Classes?
Good.
Fine.
Hnnn.
Thanks.
Stay out of trouble.
Libbets? What kind of name is Libbets?
Yeah?
Birth control.
Right. Gotcha.
What are you talking about?
What?
Good night kiddo.
Nothing.
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
That's besides the point.
But what?
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
Darn it, Dave.
It was lovely!
And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
Yeah. You?
Phone's out. I hope the pipe's --
Hi Wendy.
Who?
Nobody.
The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
It'll warm you up.
It's not a bother.
I insist.  Don't touch them.
Of course.
It's not like we're too busy.
How'd you know?
Educated guess.
No need to make excuses --
Forget what?
Forget how to ride a bike.
That's right.
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
Now you are being rude.
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
Where you going?
Do what?
What do you mean?
Am I right or am I right?
Moisture! Moisture!
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
One for you and one for me.
Major.
Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
You going to tell dad?
Would it matter?  And what's that?
Play with the whip.
The Idiot.
Hey, it's a sellable skill.
What is it?
Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
Who said so?
No one.
I don't have a girlfriend.
Yeah?
Geometry?
I'm not good at math. Just geometry.
It's freezing.
Sure.  Twinkie?
Tell Sandy? What?
Then why'd you come after me?
I dunno. I --
There's a TV in the basement.
Why did you -- with Sandy?
I don't know.
You like him? He worships you.
Wendy!
Huh?
4:30 movie. When Worlds Collide.
Yeah. Yours?
You get in trouble?
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Greetings, Charles.
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Her name's Libbets.
Charles, what time is it?
Is this Charles?
What time is it?
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
Hey Sandy.
Mikey was looking for you.
What are you doing?
Just thought I'd stop by.
Are you his girlfriend?
No.
He wouldn't blow up. He'd just get all mangled or twisted.
They left it in the jungle.
You never tasted the stuff?
One more shot?
Okay.
That's nice. Are you drunk?
I don't know. How do I know?
I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down.
That's all, for now.
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
What's that, then?
Four unwarranted shootings, witness intimidation, and cocaine theft.
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
I had him!
It's only gonna make you crazy.
Actually...
Don't worry about him...
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
Do it again.
But there wasn't any...
Yeah.  All over.
Twelve years younger.
Worth pursuing?
Byrd's dead.
Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
Where is he?
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
Anything.  It's important.
We'll get the other one, though.
Around twelve-thirty.
Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.
I told her to come.
First I need a copy of the key.
What?
That's right.
What happened at that signing?
That boyfriend.  Randy.
That's right.
Seven years.
You know what about.
To do nothing.
One word to I.A. and he walks.
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
What are we thinking?
You don't have to be involved, Will.
I'm always all business.
What did he look like?
What is it?
Huh?
You heard me that time.
But she was seeing someone else on the side.
Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
What kind of stuff?
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
The other guy?
I told you I don't remember.
After that she left the party to go to him.
Ran like hell to go to him...
Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your fucking cop questions...
She didn't tell me.
Good to see you, too, Randy.
You're not missing much.
Best friend?
Since grade school.
That's a long time.
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
Long as it's fun.
Thought you wanted something fun...
That's what I said.
You don't know.
She wouldn't tell me!
But you were such good <i>friends...</i>
My arm!
Who?
Brody...I don't know...  ...Something Brody!
The phone call.  The knapsack.
You're going to be brought in for questioning.
Yes down at the station.
But she was an attractive girl.
I suppose.
Did you have sex with her?
But you wanted to.
I was a mentor to her.
Yes.
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
He.  Well, he...
Told you I could write an ending.
There's nothing more to talk about.
But we work so well together...
Then so was mine...
Don't you pull that shit with me.
This an accident, Walter?
If you want it to be...
No back-up.
You're not following procedure.
Yes, and very beautiful.
Your lips, they didn't move.
But how did you come into existence?
If there were a leader, I would be the one.
Ah! You have questions?
What are we?
Who made us what we are?
Surely you know the one who made you...
You mean we are not children of Satan?
Perhaps...
Then God does not exist...
You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
Knew? You mean he is...
Listen to me.
No, my beloved, my child.
But why?
How he must have loved you.
Follow me - that way - through my cell -
I can't save her.
I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
You were their leader. They trusted you.
We are a pair, and that's what counts.
What night? What do you mean?
Is this my birthday?
But you're the fairest by far.
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
And if I cut my hair again?
It will grow back again!
DID YOU DO IT TO ME????
Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess.
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
No. Laudanum.
Louis, put me in my coffin...
I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
What have you done?
The way I learn everything. By watching you.
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
Why does he call you that?
Sit still. It's not finished -
Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
I can't. Go away from me.
It is! Take the back stairwell -
Not yet.
Still my beautiful child.
Claudia, you torture yourself.
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
Yes, and very beautiful.
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
Let him go, he said. Let him go.
You really believe that?
It's only mortal death.
Then my luck would have changed.
You want death? Is it death you want?
Why should I be?
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
I want it!
Call him.
I can't do it.
You've just done it -
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
But why do you want me?
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
You asked for death. I didn't promise it -
Yes...
Sure...
I want a woman.
The crucifix -
Forget the crucifix. Take him.
You have fed. You were made for this...
You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
Read her thoughts.
I can't.
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
Respect me a little then. I'm the only life you know.
I know. Let her alone.
THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!!
What are you saying?
You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine...
I didn't want to kill her.
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me ---
Are you mad????
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me?
It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
So shall we begin?  What do yo do?
Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
You can't look at them...
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
Can a vampire feel love?
How could I not? She had to know.
And did you lose her? Did she go?
But it has. There is no more to tell.
A child who can't die...
My daughter...
Checking in...Karla Wilson.
Is that bad?
Sorry. Emergencies only.
What the hell would you call this?
Who? Who is here?
Phones went down a few minutes ago.
Stupid. What were you thinkng?
That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
What are you doing in my closet?
Yet. Nothing yet.
No means yes.
But, he said he'd try.
No, I'm the King of the World.
Where is everyone? I'll ask --
I also promised Tyrell.
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
I miss Ray...I tried to call him.
Don't even think about it.
Okay, I won't.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
Not me...no way...
Just kidding.
What do we do?
No, you're not.
...Nancy?
You're okay. Thank god.
Is he?
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Ray, we're just friend.
Can't what?
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
It's gonna be great.
You know me to well.
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
Fine. Show me the body.
Ben Willis.
I told you.
Wait, it's Nancy --
I'm fine.
You sure?
I'm fine.
You don't seem fine.
Right. Now I remember.
Are you sure?
What?
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
You can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand.
It's...him.
He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
It's in my room!
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
Did you get help?
He's in it with Willis?
I guess so.
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
Rio, baby!
I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
We gotta get out of here. Now.
I said we start having fun. And that means now.
How's Julie?
He's probably the only one who can help us.
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
No. Yes?
How much?
How much?
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
Not anymore.
He leave you?
No. I shot him.
You stumbled into my hiding place.
Must have missed the sign.
Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
So why are you still here?
Crowded.
And do what with it?
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
What is up with that weirdo?
I'll go find him.
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
My friend -- what can one say --
I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
Maybe you're right. Help me get something to carry her downstairs.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
Sleep well.
I think not.
On my word! That's what they believe.
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
Closer and closer - until they bite into your throat!
I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.
Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
How old is she?
I was looking for you.
They shall not hurt you
Thea is an orphan.
What is it -- what are you talking about?
You have forgotten my last name?
My last name is Pherides.
The General  you don't even know him.
That should decide it or you --
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
Didn't you? But now -- what are you thinking now?
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
Theodosia.
Her family name?
She's not too well.
What is her illness?
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
Why -- no not before Thea came 
There's no one there - nothing but the caves and the dead.
I'll only go as far as the shore and wait for you.
Oh, now  now look here 
I can't understand that.
The rider on the pale horse is Pestilence. He follows the wars.
But the war, the army  they need you.
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
We still don't know that it's the plague 
Dr. Drossos will tell us. We will know what to do then.
If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
I had a notion you had become selfappointed chaperone lately  why?
Listen to what I say --
When you make sense I'll listen.
I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
Everything's so simple. I like you.
You see? Thea believes it, too!
I can't.
Why in the world can't you?
All I'm asking is thirty days more . . .
How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
All right  all right.
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
I'm hurrying.
Carter  bank examiner.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Suicide.
Well, who are you, then?
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
Angel, Second Class.
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
Made what?
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
You're nobody. You have no identity.
Zuzu's petals.
Yes, George?
Where's Mary?
Oh, well, I can't . . .
Where is she?
Well, keep your eyes open. See the town?
A boy?
George Bailey.
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
They went out of business years ago.
I know. I know.
I know that girl!
Hiya, George!
Hi, Bert.
Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
All right.
Of course it's the place.
Oh  Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
Yes, but he's got the faith of a child  simple. Joseph, send for Clarence.
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
Mother . . .
Mother? What do you want?
When'd you see him last?
Well, what happened to you?
I won a flower.
Want to give my flower a drink.
Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
Give the flower a drink.
I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.
Uh-huh.
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
Hee-haw!
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
A cattle boat?
All in . . .
The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick?
I'm all right.
Please don't go away  please!
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Came back three days ago.
Hmmmm . . .
Nice girl, Mary.
Hmmmm . . .
Oh, stop that grunting.
Hmmm . . .
Hmmm?
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
Well, she's not crazy about him.
Yes, sir.
Yes  charge.
Aw, get going!
Yes, sir.
Don't hurt my ear again!
Oh, it's wonderful.
Hope you enjoy it.
Where's my insurance policy?  Oh, here . . .
No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
Okay.  What's yours?
Maybe you were born older, George.
How's that?
No, I'll settle for half that in cash.
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
Very funny. Very funny.
Come on, George, let's hurry.
Say, where's Mother?
Harry . . . Harry . . .
Do me a favor, will you, George?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
She was here first.
Hello, Violet.
Hello, what am I bid?
Hello, Vi.
Nothing.
Where are you going?
Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
I know, but . . .
Yeah  yeah . . . sure I will.
Now, let's hear from you . . .
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
It's important.
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
How do you do.
Hello?
Yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now.
We'll save them for seed. A toast!
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
They're not my children.
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
Have you notified the police?
Well, what about all your other friends?
I'll take chocolate.
I don't like coconuts.
Uh-huh.
Neither am I.
Okay  what can we lose?
Ummmmm . . .
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
Uh-huh.
Come on, tell me.
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
Have you made up your mind?
About what?
Tuesday.
Where'd you get that dress?
Do you like it?
No, I don't want to be rude.
Well, then, sit down.
Don't you like her?
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
Mary . . .
That does it  come here.
Please, let's not stop, George.
I'll be back in a minute, Mary.
Thanks for dropping around.
Hi.
You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
Yeah, just started.
Where's your coat and hat?
Left them at the office.
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
Just a teensie one  ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
Going up to see Zuzu.
George, darling! Where have you been?
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
You have no idea what happened . . .
You forgot something.
What?
Sure, sure I am.
Hmm? Well, I . . .
With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
What?
You going to the lighthouse?
Well, I don't know....
What the hell.  For you....
With butter, if they got any....
How fast is enough?
I want to go faster!
So's mine.
Soon, dark eyes, soon.
But of course.
I'm supposed to.
No problem, no problem.
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
I can't help it  it sticks in my mind.
Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
I think we're changing course a little.
Stop paddling!
Back down!
Swim for it!
Is she responsible for the punch?
Good.  It's terrible.
I hope that's the cousin.
They're moving pretty fast.
Yee-hah!
We better go back in.
It's not going to be easy.
I was counting on hours.
Mostly old garbage.  Today we found a '48 Hudson.
Lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.
Too hot in the lighthouse?
We're hung up on something.
Oh, out a ways.  Maybe the lighthouse.
The Shark.
We'll take your supercargo.
Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
You're betting what you already got.
Sean!  Catch it!
Gangway, Turkies!
Let's just go sailing, okay?
Want to talk about it?
Want to swim home?
You bet.  Hang on....
Anyone got another set of sails?
Over here!
The rope!  The rope!
Can you get us a line?
Oh, yeah.  Sure.
It's okay, it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey ---
What is it?  What's there?
I need a hand here....
Aren't you off-duty?
Happy to do it.
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
In here.
What camera?
Not the drugstore!
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
You can't stop me.
Please.  It's my job.
Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.
Hey -- you can't do that.
No place special.  Just hanging out.
What else is there to do?
I'll be careful.  I'll see y'later.
Oh, c'mon.
You heard me.
Not till next year.
Yeah?
I kind of had plans....
Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
It's okay.  What happened?
At least you're safe.  What about the others?
What?
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
Okay, okay -- stand over there....
Sorry, I'm all booked up...  Come, m'dear.
Too late, it's written.
First things first.
The Shark's mouth.
What shark?
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
That's it.
Okay, so that's it.
Is there one in these waters?
What makes you think there might be?
Sound?
Late.
My boss and your boss.  Sure.
Because they're playing our song.
And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
I did, I did.
Fooling around?
Right.
Home it is.
MMMmmmorning....
Door's locked.
Good.
Mrs. Silvera.
As far as the office.
So's a donut.
What're you guys doing today?
In the den.
For me?
Careful.  What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing, huh?
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
Terrific.
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
Are you going to be able to sleep?
Yeah.   I think so.  Mike!  Keep it down, for chrissake!
That's great too.  Gorgeous.
What'd I say?
That you were fired.
Going out.
Mike's out there.
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
Perfect.  Look at this ---
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
Brody?  This is Patrol Base.
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
Yeah?  Then what?
That's what he said.
When?
Shouldn't he be at home?
What's daddy doing?
You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?
Hiya yourself.
Dad!  Dad!
Sure they did....
That's you.
I've never been supercargo.
Now I really want to see it.
Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
Shh.  Shhh....
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
I'm not crazy about blind dates.
I want you to meet my cousin.
I will, I will.
Maybe.
Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
Help!  Help!
Okay, okay, coming....
Nope.
Me neither.
Who'd you ask?
Tina Wilcox.
You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
I can't stop thinking!
What's that mean?
Nope.
Give me back my hat!
Double nope!
What about sailing?
It'll take us to Budapest if you're not careful.
What're we going to do in the mean time?
And second?
Mmmmmm.
Anything.  Anything.
What Kids?  Who went out?
Anything?
Until we find something.
What the hell is it?
Oh, great.
Now you're talking.  Let's get out of here before we do find something.
Is there something I don't know about?
I'll be right there.  Wait up.
It'll be fun, come on!
No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
You do everything your parents tell you?
I can go out if I want to.
I love it.
Coming about....
Might as well.
You going with Patrick?
Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
Coming about, then.
You always go with Andy.
How was dive class?
Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
Eat Cheerios.
Yeah.
Maybe.
Take me.
No.
Quiet!  Shhh!
Michael....
Okay, okay.  Close your door.
I'm not in the way.  Andy, am I in the way?
Would you take him?
Oh, shit.
Maybe nobody will notice.  Let's get them back in the bus.
What the hell is he doing?
Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over.  We have to deal with the consequences.
Forget it, he won't listen.
No, I'm fine, thanks.
With those camera lights and...
He's going with you, Doctor.
Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
You buying?
Sure am.
Coming with us?  Overman's buying.
Shit.
No.
She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
Never know down there.  Helps to have a friend, sometimes.
What is it, 97 days?
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Hope I make it through both.
You will.  I'll see to it.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
Pre-opening jitters.
I guess.
Don't forget you have your brother.
See you later.
Honey, I gotta go.
Okay, bye.
And what else is bothering you?
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
Yeah, you really don't like him.
I don't like what he does.
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
Get out of here!
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
I don't have a choice.
Take a deep breath and hold it.
Just put your mask on.
No.
Are you scared?
Yes.
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
They just wanted to say hello.
... Friggin' fish.
That's a lot of ground to cover.
Oh, yeah.  Very.
Let's not talk about that now, okay?
Nothing.
Up.
And leave me down here???
Make up your mind.
Yes.
After what happened to us?
I know I can capture it.
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
What's that?
Yes?
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Why?  'Cause they're hungrier?
No.
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
How's your patient?
Recovering nicely.
Me, too.
You don't.
... Mean through the tubes?
Yes.  It's faster.
No,  I'm not going through there.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
... He ought to put him in here.
It's too soon to move him.
So tell Calvin.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
Well, that's why you got it.
Hydrophobia...
Michael, take deep breaths.
I have to get out of here.
I can't take water, Kathryn.
What do you mean, we don't?
You wanted to know about a cave?
It's all controlled from the Control Room.
You two go!  I'll call Calvin!
Who's going to do it?
Me.
I am.  You're not.
I want that shark, Kathryn.
You don't have to prove anything.
Only to myself.
I'm  fine.
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
Fine.  Have them do some.
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
Make this quick!
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
No, no.  That won't do.
I told you, something's upset them.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
So do I, love.
What in hell is that?
Let's hope he knows that.
Afraid I can't do that.
Should be coming out of it soon.
Just watch it when he does.
Not at all.
So do I.  But for different reasons.
And I like you.
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
Some miss all their shots.
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
And here I thought I was charming you.
Get ready to go.
Believe me, I am.
Brian, he's coming around!
Thanks to you.
How'd it get in here?!
The water ski show!  We have to get them out!
He.  She.  Let's blow the bitch up!
They still seem nervous.
I know.
And big for his age.
Ten minutes ago.
I should have never listened to Calvin.
Sure.
'Preciate it.
He's missing.
Thanks.
Someone's looking for you.
How you doing, Kelly?
Better than catching Sean's herpes.
Yeah, from Boston.
'Course they're also so rich.
... Massachussettans aren't.
I don't know, it depends.
You like Florida?
Well, wait till you see the rest.
Depends on big brother.
I'm a water-skier.
Are you really?
Sure am.
Come on!  Check this out!
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
Why you sonuvabitch...
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
Yes, it's great!
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
No, think of something else.
I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?
Can hardly wait to do it again.
Now what's this do?
Goes up.
What, hon?
It's okay, Sean.
Take it up.
He's diving!
SEAN!
Hold still, damn it!
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
I thought I was your boyfriend.
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
I am serious.
Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
Now what?
Gotta sneeze.
Don't you dare.
Can't help it... ahh...
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
What?
Yes, there is goes.
It's disappeared.
Calvin said it was all right.
Yeah, well I didn't!
Aww, can't I keep it?
What the hell's there?
Polar bears.
Polar bears in Georgia???
South Georgia, Antarctica.
Oh...
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
Five hundred yards.
No way.
That's impossible.
Okay, okay... We'll get someone on it.
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
Look great, don't I?
Got a job for me?
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
So was Dad.
He needs a haircut.
Yeah, right.
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
That's Dad...
Gee, it's good to see you!
I want to see Kathryn.
Something wrong?
You know Overman?
We're in love.
Sure.
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
That bugger moves fast.
She is a lovely bit of crumpet at that.
Absolutely.  The audience will stain their drawers.  I did.
That's what grandmas are for.
But you always let me....
Not today.  Come on, Thea....
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
I don't want to.  I want to swing....
Was Uncle Sean ever bad?  Did you ever spank him?
My tea set.  I got my tea set.  Thank you....
Yes, you can make sandwiches....
It's time for tea, Grandma.
Nowhere....
Chicken....
It sure is....
We need milk....
I'll be right there.
Tell Matt he should be here....
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
Because....
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
I don't know...You...I don't know.
Then don't come any closer.
Turn it off....
No....
Off....
I have work....
They're at the beach....
What's wrong?  What happened?
Thea was attacked by a shark....
But it went away...We would have known....
It went away....
I don't know....
I like it.  Really....
You caught me....
You're not interfering, Ellen....
I'd be afraid of losing....
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
You make sure they come?
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
We're going down.  All of us....
We'll divert it...We'll do something....
He knows what he has to do....
Stop what?
That....
Can't help myself....
I'm hungry, Mom....
Adds flavor....
You check it....
I'm on the phone....
Good.
I won't....
What's going on?
I'd like that.  I need to be away from here.
It's too dangerous....
Thank you....
Mommy lets me....
Who's coming?
The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
I didn't.
I'll miss you....
You guys must be starving....
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
You're damn right I'm serious....
I'm just getting started....
I don't want you in the water anymore....
Dad died from a heart attack....
Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....
I'm fine....
Okay.
Good.  So will I....
Mom, please don't start that again....
You could teach...You could....
I'm not going to quit now....
I am.
He's not chasing and I'm not running. And that's ridiculous....
You're not a pain in the ass....
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
Trying to write our report....
You look tired....
I'm fine....
I have to get this finished.
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
There's nothing to worry about....
I'm your mother.  It's my job....
No.
Why'd you take the boat?
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
Promise me....
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
I always listen to my feelings....
It was no accident....
Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
I can't....
Sure you can....
I don't know how....
No one does till they learn....
Where do I pull off...?
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
It's wonderful....
Nothing....
I'm terrific... Come on....
A big one....
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
Good.  I have two left....
I have my own little island.
You're always taking time off....
I like to travel....
There are...I'm tired of one-way conversations....
There's nothing to be sorry about.
The whole idea is preposterous....
My vision is perfect....
Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....
Yes you can....
I have coffee in the thermos.
I'm too young for coffee.  Can I drive the plane?
The wind does that.  Ever been to the Bahamas before?
I'm the artist.  Like my mother.
Just like that?
We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
She said it was coming....
Hell, no.  What kind of pilot do you think I am...?
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
Will you get the bloody hell out of here....
Aye, aye, Captain....
I fly elephants for smugglers....
It needs more time to charge.
Tell Thea I'm sorry....
You don't have to say anything, Matt ...I know how you feel....
Still chasing fish?
Still tagging conch?
We'll be done pretty soon....
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
How's Ellen?
I wish there was something I could do....
She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....
Will you leave me alone...?
You tagging them...?
We'll pass around cigars....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
I stuck them on, man....
You didn't stick them on right....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
They won't fight with me....
Put me down, damnit....
Where the hell's the beer...?
I didn't do it on purpose....
Money is money....
You're afraid of the competition out there....
You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
Stop busting my hump....
I've struck the mother-lode.  I'm counting... spade work....
Spade's a garden tool....
Down here....
Gave them the day off....
As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
When we got the grant....
When I got the grant.....
When I signed on....
When I invited you...
We got it together, Jake....
Okay...we got it together....
You don't know shit about anything. Time you learned....
Lots of times....
So far..
What she's got.  Nine knots....
Shit....
What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
As long as he's been here....
How long has he been here...?
Hoagie.
What do you know about him?
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
I am...You must know something about him....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
Maybe the gear crapped out....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
Maybe it's gone....
Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
What about Carla's gig?
I'm going down, Jake....
She's not going to like it....
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Funny, Jake...Funny.
Just trying to be helpful....
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
'Snuck up on me....'
You don't like my voice...?
I don't like the song.
Screw you, Jake....
I've got to get to her....
You jump, you'll kill yourself....
It'll work....
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
My equipment doesn't crap out....
No way....
It's my fault...I have to....
Who grows more beautiful....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
More beautiful with each passing minute...
I told you....
Happy birthday, darling. ...
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
I'm training to....
Anything to do before I go home?
Deputy Brody will take care of it personally.
Yes.
The van?
Is it your vehicle?
How about any guys on your staff?
We only got one .. He doesn't drive.
I hope I'm not intruding?
Be my guest. What you got?
I think you're here all day.
O.K.
What does that mean?
Not too good in daylight ..
Because, don't get into it ...
There's nothing in the files?
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
Because it's a ritual you gotta go through with. I'm down to 10.
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
Someone bet me a dollar ..
A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..
Because I dislike her too much ..
Thank Christ we got a witness.
So am I. But where's my money?
I haven't got it.
Then give me that Zippo.
Why?
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
To throw out of the window.
I was wrong.
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
You looked like you did?
Car accident.
You don't really believe this?
No .. You didn't know that ..
I'm asking it.
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
I'm going up to the institute.
Hey ..
I guess by the bed.
It's twenty of three.
What d'you mean, "bits."
We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
You ain't going in alone?
Yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body?
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
I'm talking, outside the girl?
Once.
No.
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
No .. But we have a theory ..
Kid told me he didn't take it?
Maybe he's lying to you?
Vehicle references.
Wrong cabinet.
I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
No, it has a mind of its own.
My hands?
Yes.
What color was it?
I don't know.
No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
Hamlet. Have you read it?
No.
You should. It's wonderful.
No.
You just asked me to ask you questions.
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
No, Wordsworth .. Do you like poetry?
Pray?
I was married to her sister ..
How d'you know what I'm like?
Really? What did he say?
He said that? What else did he say?
Which is what?
Fifty-seven .. I don't mind ..
No I'm not.
It's not possible right now.
Why?
No .. not now ..
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
<u>Then explain it to me</u>. I got enough darkness, don't I?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
He don't know that. I didn't.
I know about alcohol, John.
You do?
I'm blind because my father drank.
I don't want them to arrest you.
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
Yes, Sir.
Who sought the warrant?
The man from the F.B.I.
Yeah, I guess I do.
Two or three years ago.
What was she like?
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
Don't mix very well with beer.
I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
Even better.
She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
Well, that's who she is. Cept she can't run away.
I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
Got a handshake like a partially excited penis.
I'm already walking. Where is it?
No, Sir.
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
I think I've found a hand.
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been better. Never BETTER!!
I know about the bachelor party.
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
You are not a loser.
Let's go.  I'll drive you. _ 45.
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
Jerry!  Do something --
I have to finish my job --
Look, I don't want a --
No.
It's over --
There is something missing here.
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Listen to me, it's over.
I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense.
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
Still going.
I see what you're saying.
Wait.  What do you mean?
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.
Bill, Rod, wait --
Oh, tell the story.
Now what did you lose?
My son... my mind...
Well, take care.
And have fun at your bachelor party.
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
Oh tsht. Yes.
Same to you.
Hello?
Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
It's all going to work.
I just got goosebumps.
Happy for us.
Call me later, hon.
Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
I'm glad you're home.  That "alone" thing is... not my specialty...
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
Yeah, thanks.
Good idea.  Thank you.
We will be fine!
-- especially one like this.
And I am...
Sure.
What you wrote inspired me. _ 79.
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
Yeah, I did.
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
Good evening.
Actually he said "glad." _ 85.
Plus, you could use that commission.
Yeah, what happened there.
Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
Bye you guys. _ 88.
Good night.
Easy, easy --
And I appreciate that impulse.
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
So I'll see you this weekend.
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
Why do you love me?
What --
Tell me -- let me help --
You want...
I don't know --
...my soul or something. _ 117.
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
So this break... is a break-up.
Come on, Jerry.  You know this isn't easy for me.  _ 118.
Of course, medical! _ 42.
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
He's in the living room asleep.
At eleven at night? _ 70.
You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go.
It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
I'll give it everything.
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
Let's do it again.
I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."
I might call you later!
Very much.
That's your word?
No, I air-dry.
No, I'm saying to be --
Forget it.  Forget it.
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
It's a risk.
Good deal, man.
What do you know about dating a single mother?
Then you gotta have The Talk.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
What's that supposed to mean?
You don't want to go home, do you?
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
I'm asking you a question --
No, you're --
Beautiful.
Only 'cause my wife likes your wife!
Go.  Flee.
I missed ya.  What can I say?
What --
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
But wait...
Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
Not a chance.
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
What DO you stand for???
Don't be silly.
I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
I'm fine.  What's up?
I came here to let you go. _ 27.
Came here to fire you, Jerry.
I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
Dick.
You wanted smaller.
Thanks.  May I offer you both a ride?
They do, my brother.
I'm not your brother!
Hi Ray.
Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
Funny.
Right up ahead, buddy --
It's in a cage.  Do not be scared of...
Quiet!
This is how you play God.
One way to find out.
What is it?
A bird cage.
What's a bad idea?
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
People change.
So do you.
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
What?
Nothing.
What did you say!
Just drop it Paul!
Eric...
I filmed this the morning they left.
Eric!
When did you have it last?
I don't remember
Think.
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
You mean it?
He's not a kill, he's still alive.
Where is it?
DAD!
I didn't know, there were two islands.
I thought you were an expert.
Dr. Grant was.
It won't hold!
Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.
They're here.
What?
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
I don't think so.
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
They never got that big.
Baryonyx?
I don't remember that on InGen's list.
Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
KEEP GOING!
NO!
Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
Really?  What do you do there?
Raptors, mostly.
My favorite.
To a degree we never imagined.
Goodbye, Alan.
Alan don't be afraid to evolve.
In Costa Rica?
On the island.
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
Yeah.
What did you think?
Are you sure?
Why?
No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
Something must've scared them.
You're right.
No we're not.
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
Sure you have. You wrote that book...
But you never came across just one.
Back out! Move!
Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
Just a little bit too much, I think.
It certainly does.
Minimal.
Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
-- my --
-humidity, I know.  Highest lead density on the market.
Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
Everyone, keep your voices down!
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
Kelly!  What are you doing here?
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
My vacation is over in a week.
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
Which one?
That was about a year ago.
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
Where does it say that?
On the side of that one truck.
Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
Come on!
What?  Why?
Good lad.
To collect my fee.
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
Isn't it obvious?
The velociraptors.
Piss.
Operations building.  Far end of the street.
Why?
You version of it.
It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
Piss.
Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
Oh, God.
She's nuts.
Oh, my God.
You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
Our chance to do what?
No!  Get in the car before they hear us!
What do you think they want?!
What are they?
I don't know.
Where's Kelly?
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
I have to find Kelly!
I think she's with Sarah!
DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
Look!  Sarah!
What's that?
Why did you come here?
So that others would know about this place?
Because it exists.
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
Four, counting the one in the chamber.
Funded by whom?
John Hammond.
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
What?!
What?
These formations.  They're dried --
Birdshit?
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
You think this is all a joke?
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
Oh, no!
I'm trying!
JUMP!
Where's Ian?
Can the kid walk?
It's not worth taking the chance, John.
So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
The monitors are failing.
Where did the vehicles stop?
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
Uh - - about two million.
Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
'Bout thirty seconds.
Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
These are dilated.  Take a look.
They are?  I'll be damned.
That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
Oh my God.
Could I have a tissue please?
Oh my God.
Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
They smell.
They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
The Cretaceous.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
What kind of park is it?
The - - agility.  You're right!
We're out of a job.
Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!
Dilophosaurus.
Not just every six weeks.
Yeah, I know.
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
- - totally incidental  unrelated to the feeding pattern - -
- - and swallows fresh ones.
Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
You can't hold it by yourself!
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
The other car!
Alan!
I don't know.
They're not here.
Okay.
Stick to my heels.
Why not?
Like hell it is!
I know, it's very exciting.
And scary.
Anti-nature.
Yeah.
Please - - chance it.
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. 
Hola, bienvenido
Dilophosaurus.
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
People were gettin' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - -
In a box under my seat.
Are they heavy?
Yeah.
Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
I've never been a rich man.  I hear it's nice.  Is it nice?
Oh, yeah - - great.
Tim.
I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
Tim, I'll come back for you.  I'll get Lex out first.
That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
Yes it is.
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
Maybe -- it's hard to say.
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?
But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
Tim, I'm right here.  Easy catch.  Easy catch.  Count to Three..
Try to!
You have no idea.
Yeah, they hate me.
I know.
Fine.
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
Relatively.
We gotta do something.
What?  What can we do?
There's gotta be something - -
For today, I guarantee it.
John Hammond.  And I am delighted to finally meet you in person Dr Grant.
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
For a further three years.
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
It's safe.
It's safe.
No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.
All night?
All night.
You're a beautiful big animal.
Please!
Okay.  Keep low.  Follow me.
Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick!
Timmy!  Do as he says!  Timmy!  Do as Dr. Grant says, quick!
Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
I certainly have!  Very clearly!  Because of the behavior of the system in phase space!
Don't do that!
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
Thanks for the presents.
We love the presents.
Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!
Why did you do this?
What if we fall?  I hate trees.
They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.
That means they only eat vegetables.  But for you, I think they'd make an exception.
That was great!
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
Ken, we've been through this...
Yeah?
I think we're lost.
You have a map.
You learn something new every day. Let's go.
I want to look at the rest of the house.
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
What about that other guy?
Other guy?
He... he's here...
Who's there?
Jas... Jason Voorhees... he's here...
What?
His camera... it's still recording.
_Krueger_...
Who?
Compared to this guy... amateur.
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
He's fucking nuts.
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
How do we prove it?
That's open to debate.
He's my client, and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
Me too. I'm drunk.
Yeah, what is it?
_It's a second REM pattern_.
Add it to the list.
So what do we do?
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
Then we're all in a lot of trouble.
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
About ten minutes.
Ten minutes...
Up there.
Yes -- that's us.
Yes -- we do.
Have you worked here long?
No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.
What was the matter with it?
You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society.
You were his friend.  One link is all they need.
Perhaps Eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced.
I don't know what you could have read.
-- In magazines nobody reads.
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
A man must eat --  And drink.
The <u>Castle</u> cemetery.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
Yes.
It's my last and final one.
Then its authority is in doubt.
A true friend would do it.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
No, I left it in his office.
Did you see him?
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
It's what I'm paid to do.
And you're late!
Sit down, Kafka.
In a small way.
Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
Why would you suppose so?
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
One of you must be mistaken.
I've never seen you here before.
Have you looked?
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
When I have no reason to doubt.
Tonight?
Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
Eduard wanted to marry me.
And you ...?
You won't have any trouble finding it.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
Why were you given notice?
I wouldn't put it past him.
He's jealous, yes, but <u>that</u> jealous?  He's too cautious.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
Eight -- and seven months.
Was he depressed?
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
What makes you think so?
... Just a perception.
She's missing.  I went to her house and she hadn't returned there.
What did she say?
You mean you've actually begun some?
It's a farce.
-- Oh, yes, it's mad.
He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
Oskar.
We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
And we're upset too.
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
Ludwig?
They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
What's to become of us now?
Amerika!
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
Now Ann ...
Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
Do they have him on display at the weekends?
No!
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
I can't imagine you crying.
Leave it, Ann.
We're leaving.
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
Jack!...  Jack!
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
Oh my God ... Ann?
That's your monkey, Denham.
Kong ...
How about Ann? Is she going with you?
Yeah.
Why?
Coz of something I lost.
What's that?
Compassion.
What's compassion, mister.
Can't you see I'm strung out?  Please, we're waiting for it -- he's got to have it!
Did he come around often?
She was with you after she left Frank.
Please --
Guess!
Do you always have to repeat?
Look -- could I use your phone?
Yes indeed.
Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
I guess he figured it was better.
What was better? I made better bait?
No, that's not --
-- We can talk --
-- Yes.
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
Will you let me go then?
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
I said yes, I see.
Oh no, I don't think --
My name's John Klute.
You said that.
Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?
What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
I can't say he was anybody!
How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
OK.
-- OK?
What do you think?
Can't you get him?
He never told me.
Well, let's go down and ask him.
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
I don't see anything, do you?
What're you gonna do next?
Try some other ways. 
You said it was!
No, I said what did you think.
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
Not much point to this, is there?
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
-- Then you don't need me.
But if it's someone else I do.
The same as Jane McKenna.
I don't get you.
Ligourin: How could you do it?
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
We did this before.
What am I supposed to say?
You and I -- a relationship.
I was wondering what that was.
Hell there's nothing so mysterious about the square life.
Don't touch anything.
Go down in my room.
With Trina.
I called Trina.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
How do you know how bad it was?
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
You're going back?
Mm.
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. 
I believed her, Pete.
I better keep looking.
Where, how?
You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
Just send me a money order.
No, I'd -- like to be in on it.
Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
I wanted to give it to you first.
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
Goodbye, Pete.
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
Town Police.
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
Yeah.
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
What else do you know?
No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
Yes?
He's in his room, playing.
Good.  I'll see him in there.
Not particularly.
What does?
The prospect of losing my child.
I see you have people there. What are their names?
Oh, sure.  Here, this can be mommy.
Do you like to be with your mommy?
Lunch in a restaurant.
What do you like best about your daddy?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
Welcome to the... 
Greatest...
Show...
On earth.
Soon.  Very soon.
Right.  One O.J. coming up.
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
Will she pick me up after school?
Yeah?
I guess...
Uh huh...
We use the green and yellow.
C'mon, Billy.  I'm trying to work for God's sake...
That's okay.
I hate it.
I'm allergic to onions.
You are not allergic of onions.
Oh, for God's sake...Here.
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
Then eat around it.
No.
Tough shit.  You're stuck with me.
Yeah?
Uh huh?
Are you...gonna go...away?
You mean for good?
Oh...
Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
See you in the morning light.
I love you...
See you in the morning light...
Sure.
Sure.  Lots of times.
Right.
You like it?
Yep.
Is that really your chair?
No, she never did.
Are you going to get remarried?
I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
Boy, I bet you if mommy ever saw this she'd remarried you.
Uh, huh?
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Uh, uh...We didn't have television then.
Yeah, there was apple juice.
What don't you understand, pal?
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
Your mom.
Overruled.
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
Did you wish to?
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
And what is your present salary?
I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.
Yes.  Very much.
And yet you chose to leave him?
Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child?
Objection!
And did you have a close personal relationship?
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
I understand and I'm absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up....  ...after the first of the year.
A heavy drinker?
No.
Was he unfaithful?
No.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
I don't recall.
Do you have a lover now?
I...I don't know...
How long was that?
Yes.
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
I'm not taking him with me.
I don't know...
So do you.
Fine.
You have?
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
Joanna, go fuck yourself!
Ted, do you love him?
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Ted, do you love him?
Only can I still see him?
No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
Jim, I've got to go.  I'm already late--
Yes, what?
Yes, I'll have dinner with you.
Kramer...
Murray.
I'm going to take it.
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
Do you want the kid or don't you?
I lost him?  I lost him?
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.
I'll take my chances.
It's going to cost.
Don't worry.  I'll get the money.
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
It's beautiful.  It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.
Yeah.
Any prospects?
How the hell are you going to do that?
Ten.
Mr. Kramer, there's--
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
Ted, don't be so hostile.
I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
You're on your own, understand?
I understand.
You're sure?
I'm sure.
Uh, huh...Yeah...
What d'you tell her?
I told her you're doing a
What?
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
Any day.
Uh, huh...
Please, Thel...
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
A moment.
Yes. I am ready.
Yes, Holiness.
Where are you from?
Kham, Holiness.
Again?
Tell me.
It is alright, Father.
Can I do anything I want?
But, I am in charge.
And you have horses? You love horses.
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
Will you buy the sheep for me?
Where will you keep them?
Here. We'll collect them.
I will buy them for you.
Can I free the prisoners?
Hmmm.
No!
We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
General Chiang.
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
Thank you. Please sit.
I have a copy for you.
The Sera monks have surrendered?
It is calm.
We did not.
The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.
I am afraid.
Time to study.
Yes.
Far, far away.
I miss him too.
Two.
Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.
We do not know.
Do I have money?
Do you have money?
Not until you are eighteen.
Roughly five thousand men.
Is that big?
No. This war is almost over.
It is an island. American territory.
Where is Alsace?
I do not know, Holiness.
He warned about the future of Tibet.
When it is time.
What is the danger from the Chinese, now?
Britain chooses not to.
And, America?
America, we shall see.
In the Americas.
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
I had relinquished doubt.
The people will not allow it.
Good day.
Please, come in, so cold.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
You will always!
Is that a true story, or pretend?
What do you think?
True.
Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
I have smarter men.
It is a story, you decide.
As you say.
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
The Chinese.
Yes.
Ahh.
Where is Poland?
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
No, Holiness.
Am I running away?
You have grown up very good.
Eliminate you.
It may not be your decision to make.
You are unharmed?
Completely.
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
Too young?
Much too young.
I see that.
Oh, yes.
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
You're all fuckers.  Vicious little fuckers.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
It happens when I land.
Why are we landing?
<u>So</u> <u>why</u> <u>are</u> <u>we</u> <u>landing</u>?  <u>Hector</u>.
I need to see his habitat.
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
I do <u>not</u> like you.
What the hell are you doing?!!
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
You're crawling around like a--
I'm laying a spring trap!
A spring trap!
This could end up saving your life,--
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
No crocodile has ever--
Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
Yup.
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
It came from across the lake.
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
Then do it!!
I don't know!
Bastard bit my chopper.
That's actually the easy part.
You ready on shore?
We're ready.
You do?
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
You talk to Bickerman?
Just those two.
As if.  Will you miss me?
Are you sure?
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
Excuse me?
No.
Eh.  Fuck it.
Yes.  You may.  But maybe... I don't know...
Could we have intercourse?
Guess I finally got bit.
Yeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix it.
Yeah.  Thanks to you.
Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
Are we all museum bigots in Maine?
Never been to Maine before?
I <u>told</u> you.
I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks.
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
I'd be able to see something.
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
It's too dangerous for--
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
You flew up here because your boss--
Good.
'Night.
Good luck.
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
Um... y'know...  Yeah.
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
You <u>did</u>, you--
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
It's okay.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
Thank you.
Night.
What?
I heard something.
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
I'm not mushing it.
You're mushing it a little around the--
<u>I'm</u> <u>not</u> <u>mushing</u> <u>it</u>.
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
Really--
You calm down!
<u>Calm</u> <u>down</u>.
Look.
We might as well pack.
Good idea.
Well...
He's floating.  Take it home.
Hector.
You wouldn't?
Take him.
I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
He heeds a tourniquet.
But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
Likewise.
Let's go.
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
I'll call the coroner.
White perch.
Are they feeding?
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
They look like they're jumping.
Obviously I was wrong!
<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
Where is he?!
I'll take it!
Hector.  <u>Do</u> <u>not</u> <u>move</u>.
You too.
Did he say anything?
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
Yes.
I'm fine, thank you.
This is a little different.
I can look at dead things.
Not yet.
I got nothing against--
Ever even been <u>in</u> one?
It's just that--
Sheriff.
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
I thought I saw...
It looks like a branch.
You threw it at me!!
I just let go of it.
I asked you to be nice to him.
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
You think Jack's handsome?
What is this?
Yes.
He said he knew Karate!
Look.
I don't know.  Back the truck--
Wait.
Kevin, hey.
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
Yes, well...  famished.
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
Kelly--
I'm not even a field person.
Well on this one I'd like you to be.
Liar?
Myra.
Shitbutt?
Never cock. Just squeeze.
I love it when you talk dirty.
Thanks, Ardelia.
Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
Why does she keep repeating the name?
Why not?
He's here, Ardelia.
But why? He didn't weight the others.
Hot damn, Clarice.
He knew her...!
You're all right! Where is he?
Get me out!
Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.
But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company.
Okay, Mr. Yow...
That wasn't me.
Oh.
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
Not yet! - just wait for me.  Maybe in about two seconds.
I think we may be, yes.
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
Murdered...? How?
Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
You do until six p.m.
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
May I see your credentials?
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
Maybe they'll catch up.
I have no doubt of it.
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
Memory, Officer Starling, is what I have instead of view.
How many women has he used, our Bill?
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
Reasonably so. Yes.
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Why? Do you know something about him?
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
Ahhh... Why?
Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
Big through the hips. Roomy.
They all were.
Mmm. And what else...?
A moth... How did you predict that?
I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
Two months.
Why so briefly?
I - ran away...
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
Did he try to?
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
No! That's incidental.
What was it?
Yes...! They were screaming.
So you ran away...
Thank you, Clarice.
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
Dr. Chilton... I believe you know each other?
Did you breast-feed her?
Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.
No fair! You lured him with produce.
Officer Starling. Welcome back.
Yes, miss.
Can we rest soon?
Absolutely.
Well that is to be expected. My father...
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
Miss.  May I?
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
What would you have me do?
Do not.  Promise me.
Maybe...
Alice?
I have nothing to go back for.
My letter...
There was none!
What?
There was no letter.
I sent three men to Webb!
Aversion?  No... "Hatred"... "Loathing"...
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
Yes. Yes, I will.
It can be dangerous...
He delivered no such message.
I am sorry, Duncan...
What the bloody hell plan is this?
What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
...Fort William Henry.
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
Dark haired...
No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
Fort Edward, then?
No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?
Do not let gratitude get in the way...
Ottawa!
Excuse me...
That is the truth!
We don't.
I don't understand!
: Only one or two loads.
I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
We'll see in the morning...
You're not coming with us?
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
Yes, sir.
The decision is final.
Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
Fire!!!
Sir!
Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
Wampum?
Yes.
For Munro children?
Yes.
The King? The King has mountains of gold!
Heart. Give Magua new heart.
Granted.
My colors?
Allow me to consult with my officers.
Le mot d'ordre?
La victoire.
Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
Intelligence may not be the right word...
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
What has?
Can you fix it?
No way...
No!
That's an order!
I got hung up!  Try this!
Just get in yours!
Huh?  I...uh...uh...
What?
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
Still...you did the right thing.
Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
You screw around like that again and--
Good...It's going good.
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
The escape bubbles?
Seeing how my stock's doing...
How much time does that give us?
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
Where's Jones?
I can't see them!
He's not at his station.
...I'd really have to show it to you.
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
It bit me!
What's your air reading?
Twenty minutes...
Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
Ahhhh!
Okay.
No...she killed herself.
Unfortunately.  We can't.
But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
Not yet.
How's TransOcean doing?
I signed-up for the stock option.
Timex...
Hook's on 24...
...and a Russian grandmother...
Itches like hell.
What music?  There ain't no music.
Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
I'm going to kill it!
Twelve hours!
Two hundred meters.
We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
What are you going to do to him?
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
It's had a meal.
Like a leech.
Let's hope it holds.
Sixpack...
I ought to smack your face!
DeJesus...It's got him.
Oh man, that's just great...
The good doctor signed our death warrant.
The air's stopped.
Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...?
Answer them and quit kicking me!
I'm not touching you!
Don't worry, darlin, I'm...
Seven hundred for the pair.
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
A traffic warden. Look, what's this?
The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
Well what?
I thought this was a pub.
You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.
Like antiques.
You get the guns?
I don't know what you mean.
There were two old guns there; where are they?
I am not fucking interested.
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
Where did he get a hundred grand?
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
Fucking Northern monkeys.
Can I help?
Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
They were going to pay, then?
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
I am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John.
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
Is he on his own?
Just carrying a bag.
Let's have a look, shall we?
Try that one.
Well, put your seatbelt on then.
Is that you, Dean?
Sure is.
What can I do for you?
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
Jesus, I have heard about him.
The stupid bastards! Count it!
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
I didn't touch him, he just passed out.
Just give me the keys.
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
How about you? All right?
There is only three of us here.
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Out the back.
And the weed?
Out the back.
Invitations?
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
What do you mean?
I mean it's fucking empty.
He means they're thieving dogs.
Why, what's up?
Right as rain.
What do you mean, me?
. . . What?
I'll only be a minute.
A hundred grand.
Never mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that.
Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
You will what?
I will loan you the money.
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
For half a million?
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
It's pay day, ain't it?
I like your bar.
Yes?
I want your bar.
And?
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
Lives and learns doesn't one.
Of course you are. All right, Ed.
You know how much it is, Nick.
And that does include the amp?
You know it doesn't include the amp.
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
You've already been fifteen.
At what, exactly?
My van is half full.
So?
You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
You would take a pain n the arse full stop.
Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.
Er, well, twelve.
Er, fertilizer.
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
Leave your sister out of it.
--you're going to be on your own.
Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
I-I can do the job, sir.
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
I am, sir.
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
Who's "they"?
The--the officers.
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
I mean, follow orders, sir.
Because it's a job?
Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
Yes, sir.
You're dismissed, Private.
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
You're dismissed.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
And you and Private Graves--
We were just dancing--
Sergeant?
I'm feeling okay--
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
Yeah, this is Skinny.
Skinny?
That badge--
Everybody on the border knows that story.
A .45--
He swore by it.  What?
Just wondering.
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
You're fired. You're outta the department.
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
Best part of the job.
What?
Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam.
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
Come on in--
If it's too late--
Come on in.
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
Uncle Al--
He never asked her.
Go out through the back.
Same as they done in Mexico.
But they were Indians themselves.
They were in the Army. Like your father.
You know who I am?
I got a pretty good guess.
That guy who got shot--
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
Didn't have a father?
He's still pissed off about it.
"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"
No.
Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
Yeah. He lives here, right?
He does.
Fifteen years in El Paso.
Made some money, came back here--
Something like that.
Lead mine.
It's a lead mine.
Right.
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
You going to get married?
Maybe.
Yeah?
What's it doing on a rifle range?
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
We should just do it.
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
Man's gonna retire in two years and he offer to quit. Big goddamn deal.
Masons been around a long while.
If the next guy's a redneck.
Yeah. I bet he would.
That's where he fell.
You get much of that in here?
Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
Because I'm your father.
No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
Bandidos, Injuns--
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]
Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
Buenas noches, Senora Cruz. Enrique walks in the opposite direction--
Quien es? [Who is it?]
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
I have some friends who have had a accident--
You have somebody else out there?
We was crossin' the river--
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
I thought you were married!
We have a daughter.
Tipico.
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
Don't worry about it. He owes me some favors.
Hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
That Buddy was a cool breeze.
Seems like we have another one every week.
Jorge and his Chamber of Commerce boys got to keep things hummin'--
Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--
That's a matter of interpretation--
We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd.
Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
I haven't been out here for a while.
You go by your old house?
We found a body out by the Army base yesterday. Been there for a long time.
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
We have a murder?
Charley Wade.
Do you?
Hey, Sam.
Open late.
Buddy Deeds was a murderer.
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
Steve?
Your mother's family is Spanish?
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
The Sheriff.
You told me one time it was true love.
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
Right. When he was killed.
A little older than Paloma is now.
How come you never got married again?
Nobody's too busy.
I don't mean Fernando.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
I never said that. It was just that boy--
"That boy"--Mami, say his name for chrissakes!
That's me.
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
I've seen 'em.
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
You had to deal with him in running the club.
Okay? He's not here?
No. Is he sick?
He's going to wish he was dead.
And that was the last time you saw him?
Could of been. That was white people's business.
And when my father was Sheriff?
What about it?
What was your deal with him?
Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
What?
You gonna stay out here?
What do you think?
It's Saturday.
You got in late last night.
Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
I only went for my last two years.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
Time marches on.
How much you got left?
Three months.
I got a bad stomach. It helps me digest.
Different charge. I had a still. Made my own mescal.
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
They've got my Amado.
Got him here?
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
I'll see what's going on.
Yeah. I'll go check on your boy.
Are you okay?
Want to take a walk?
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
So she tells me three times a week.
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
Most people did, yeah.
Weird what you remember.
Amado.
Nice-looking kid.
He hates me.
No--
Pilar--
Yeah.
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
So what are we gonna do about this?
Two years.
Yeah?
What was your father's name?
Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.
Couple months before I was born--
Yeah--
Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
Yeah.
I been working on a few things.
Gotta be in person.
Oh.
You'd do a good job.
Don't know if I'll still want it.
I didn't want to be going around your back.
I appreciate you telling me.
Well, it's a complicated issue--
You don't need to cuff me.
No, Sheriff, I'm just--
And people better clear out of here! Now!
What's up?
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
You sell much out here?
But you don't see much competition, do you?
Me neither.
Name's Otis.
Otis what?
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
Uh-huh.
Why you think that was?
Been away. Up to Houston.
You going to tell him?
He doesn't need to know all my business.
He's gonna find out.
So? What's he gonna do, arrest us?
Yeah.  It's French.
Thirty-five bucks.
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
You bet.
Nix.
Nix?
Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
Who is he?
You heard right.
You ever been married?
I love weird.
doorway) And who's that?
A Nix specialty?
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
Right.
Isn't that French for something?
That's so cool.
Why would I do that?
Beats me.
I told you --
I know him.  I saw him.
Death.
What about death?
It's an illusion.
I could scoop them out.
Don't.
I don't know.
You'll do more.than that.
Not yet.
It's him... it's him.
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
Be ready.
He's with us... He's with us...
And are you afraid?
Yes.
Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
And you don't ask questions?
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
Harry.
I'm no bodyguard.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
They won't tell you anything.
I can be very persuasive.
Why?  Because he had you?
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
You didn't marry him for love.
That's my business. Harry.
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
He was the real thing, right?
Some or it.
What then?
I'm here, aren't I?
Nothing you don't want.
Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
Are you sure?
I'm sure.  He's dead.
I know.  I'm the one who shot him.
Yes.
Quaid and Jennifer--
It's okay.
Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
Hang on!
You can't.
Harry...
I'm here, Harry.
...yes?
Yes.
I... have... to.
I'm okay.  I'm okay.
I think so.
Harry-?
Out!  Out!
Good.  There.  Yes?
You saw this?
No word from D'Amour?
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
Sure.
Somebody killed him.
Oh God.
I just saw him.
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
He got up and walked.
--vanished.
Another fucking magician. Jesus.
I heard he was the best.
If he was so good why's he so dead?
I'd like to hear them.
He was a freak.  Everything he did was tainted.
Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
Mr. D'Amour?
Go away.
It's one in the afternoon.
What are you, my mother?
Then what do you want?
I'm here to offer you a job.
I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
Mine.
Maybe I just bought it.
Somebody's been smoking in here for months.
You know of him?
I saw him in Vegas once.
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
Probably.
I don't think the dead much care.
Are you sure?
Are you a believer, then?
Swann's wife.
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
Why'd you come here?
A ticket home,
Yes.  It's regrettable
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
What for?  You need to stay busy?
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
I'm afraid she's not in.
When will she be in?
Yeah, I know.
You want more money, is that it?
Shut up!
No.
Was that Swann's idea?
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
Shit...
Help me.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
What about?
A Mister Quaid?
She has no real grip on reality.
What?
Yeah.  You could say that.
Yes...
Who is he?
What?
That.
Harry D'Amour.
Sure.  Vivovich.
For an introduction.
Well... nobody.
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
How the fuck do you do that?
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
He deserved it.
Oh yeah?
It's me betrayed him.
Will that do?  No?
Didn't know you read minds.
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
Yes.
Jesus!
Looks that way.
He's better off this way.
Nobody's better off this wav!
You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
In my time, and nobody else's.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
You didn't try hard enough.
Can you do it?
I don't know.
Call me tomorrow.
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
A couple of weeks.
One question.
What?
Who is she?
No.
What about Philip Swann?
I knew Swann.  He's a fucking liar.
Who's not?
Is he the Puritan?
Yes! Yes!
And he's dead?
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
Binding you.
Why would I want to?
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
Liar!
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
Bob, it's me.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Yeah, I'll stay.
Two years.
Try twenty-five.
What do you do?
What did you study?
Philosophy.
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
No, how about you?
Not really. How long are you here for?
I'm here for the week.
See you later.
I know. I don't either.
Charlotte, who?
I see them every morning.
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
Yeah, you don't remember?
No, you smiled.
I don't remember.
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
No, I was looking at you.
I know.
No, yes, it does...
Yeah? But look at you.
That's ok.
And marriage, does that get easier?
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
We established that we have no communication.
No one ever tells you that...
John thinks I'm so snotty.
You are.
How old is she?
Four.
Oh, she'll love it.
Fuck off.
We should get you to the doctor.
You think so?
Working.
Do you ever see him?
Yes, but no, I can't right now.
A coke.
Around.
That lunch was the worst, huh.
Tomorrow.
I'm going to miss you.
That's what you said the other night.
Well, I mean it more now.
Hi, Bob.
That'd be great.
Yes.
Thanks.
Ok, bye.
I'll miss you.
Yes?
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Oh?
Can I enter?
Yes?
Do you like massage?
I don't think so.
Mr. Kazuzo send Premium Fantasy.
Yes?
Take them.
Hello, darling.
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
Bob?
Hi, Lydia.
Uh, no.
It's just carpet.
That's not what I'm talking about.
What are you talking about?
Is there anything I can do?
You know, eat healthier.
Alright?
Not all that pasta.
Fine.
Like Japanese food.
Hello, Bob, it's me.
Hello?
It's Lydia, your wife.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
Fine. Is it going ok?
It's ok.
Do you want to- 
What?
When are you coming home?
Tomorrow.
Thank you, Mr. Harris.
Hospital?
One moment, please.
Hello, can I have room 5601.
One moment.
What?
Why do you have to defend her?
Good...I'm tired.
You wanna come?
Sure.
Ok.
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
What?
I got some hair stuff.
I gotta go to work.
Bye.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
I gotta go... and I don't really like champagne.
Are you sure you have to go?
It'll just be a few days.
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
Promoting that action movie I did...
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
No!  Hi! So great to meet you!
She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
It's probably trivial.
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Uh...sure...I...what?
Sushi.
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
Now that you're on TV, you're a magnet for all the wackos out there.
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
What happened?
When did they find her?
I can't believe Will killed him.
Thank God he did.
I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
I'm just temporarily off my game.
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
I believe in you.
I don't know.  What are they?
I found them in your file box.
Must be a spare set.
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
Peter, are you okay?
Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
Yes.  It's exactly...
Eight.  That okay?
Quiet.  Real quiet...
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
You heard voices, you know you did.
I hope so.
Something he said, just before...
He spoke to you?
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
Just open the door, please.
What do you mean "don't worry?"
Yes.  We won, that's right.
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.
Well I know he's come here before.
Peter...Peter Kelson.
You just call?
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
Yes... and you are?
Thank you.  Do you work in the building? You coming from the party?
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
And also that...
Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
What if I told you I was a malignant narcissist?
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
I think you gave me the wrong one.
You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
Peter, please...
The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
I'm going to look around.
What's the...OH SHIT!
When's your birthday?
What?
That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
What's the bible for?
Comfort.
We're going to do this.
You have to say that.
That's true.
I was desperate.  I knew you wrote about murders.  I needed a way in.
Maybe that's my problem.
What are these?
And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
Not a lot.
Whish the circumstances were different.
I know who he is.
Maya?  What do you mean?
I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
A lot of good that'll do.
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
I'm not waiting until it's too late.
You are the younger of two...
Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
Goodbye.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
He can see you Thursday.
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
It's Detective Smythe.
We millionaires yet?
Of course.
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
Yeah, yeah.  I've heard it before.  Just be sure you spell my name right.  Nine o'clock?
He's looking right at me.
I'll quit, maybe you should start.
How're you doin' today?
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
You got the right attitude, anyway, look, we gotta talk.
She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13.
Yeah, murder-suicide.
What happened?
She told me she killed them.
Nothing.
Oh, all that work.
I can't eat before a game.
Child, take a bite.
Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.
Nothing.  So good luck.
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised to see you.
He's still at the bank.
I can manage.
Engaged.
To that stewardess?
Yeah, you met her?
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
There you go.
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
The blue.
You sure?
Thanks, sweetheart.
Okay.
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
This time get your feet set.
You want the job or not?
You're cold?
Careful.
Huh?
That was two words.
Then I'll get you some punch.
Uh-huh.
Shh.  It's okay.
Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.
You could make a career by telling me where.
Gotta wait til the press conference.
I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
Yes, we appreciate that.
What?
I don't wanna see that.
Get used to it, babe.
Four days.
Why not?
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
I don't know sometimes.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
Just try and chill a little bit, alright.
I found you someone.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
I know...
Mom tell you to do this?
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
He's in college?
And he's fine, girl.
How'd you get him to say yes?
I told him you looked like me.
You do.
Yeah, right.
Too many times.
They ever love you back?
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
I was just showing emotion.
Chances are there's still a chance.
Dad.  What are you doing here?
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
I'll take that as a compliment.
She hates all freshmen.
You were trying to make me look bad.
Didn't have to try very hard.
Just wanted to say good game.
What's up, Sidra.
How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian?
You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
I wouldn't know.
Lucky.
Uh huh.
I just can.
He works at a bank.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
Oh.
For how long?
Five seconds.
Man, forget you then, stupid.
I know this.  What do you want?
A ride home.
Your legs don't look broke.
Guess "please" would be a stretch.
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
I don't.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
Your hot-ass temper.
Would you watch the damn road?
Didn't know you cared so much.
I don't.
Yeah.
You don't look half-bad.
Hey.
You having fun?
Guess not.
Figures.
What?
You had four offensive rebounds.
I know, right?
What'd it say?
I can't be nice to a fan?
Quit.
What are we playing for?
Clothes.
What?
My court, I go first.
Plan to.
I wanted you to.
Why not?
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
What's up?
It happens, right...
Nobody.
Who's nobody?
You want to go talk?
Not really.
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
Nah.  I have curfew.
Hey, what's up.
You weren't at my game.
Woman...
What the hell's going on?
We're going to get some food.
Are you out of your mind?
Talk to your new girlfriend.
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
Least she had time for me.
So you fucked around to prove a point!
Least you got your priorities straight.
I never asked you to choose.
Never had to.
Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me?  Go fuck Dick Vitale.
You're what?
Few days ago.
So that's it, just forget about us?
Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
What are the doctors saying?
I forgot, "Q-man."
We won the championship.
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
Oh yeah?
What do you mean?
Who's this guy I always see her around?
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
So...how's the knee?
Getting there.
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
Maybe go back to school.
Wow.
Why do you keep asking me that?
Cause I don't get it.
Something was just missing.
What?
From basketball.
Wrong.
What?
One game.  One-on-one.
For what?
So you're gonna bitch up?
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
Hey.
There's so many I just can't keep track.
Well, can you give him this for me?
I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.
Business folks.
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
Keep your voice down.
What's that, not great?
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
He tore his ACL.
Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
We still have to go?
Yeah.
You hearing me?
I've been hearing you.
Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
Yup.
Said he'd be home later.
Sorry.  You okay?
I'm fine.
This is just about money, you know that.
"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
You don't wanna hurt your back.
You know, people.
I just told you.
I mean, it's not true, is it?
Your door was unlocked.
Still is, so let yourself out.
We need to talk.
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
Came by to check on you.
After five years.
Good.
And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
Oral surgery.  Corrective teeth surgery.
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
You ok?
ooohhhhhh no.
In my sleep, Burt.
What's wrong?
Hello, Phil.
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
Well can you connect me to someone else?
Well what's the situation?
Does this sound weird?
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
Brain and Lung.
My mother had breast cancer.
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
It was scary though.
It's a helluva disease.
Sure is.  So why call me?
It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
GET OUT.
LAPD. Open the door.
I'm coming!
Yeah, but I don't know --
You don't have a boyfriend?
No.
Who was it?
You just move in here?
About two years ago.
Bit messy.
Yeah.
I don't have a boyfriend.
Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
That's great, thank you.
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
You take cream or sugar?
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
I don't have a boyfriend.
The gentleman who came to the door --
-- is not my boyfriend.
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
yeah, good, ok.
Bye, bye, Claudia.
Good bye.
What is it?  Did you forget something?
No.
Yeah.
It's my favorite place --
Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.
Bye.
Well I don't go out very much.
What?
You really use strong language.
-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.
I'm sorry.
ok.
Can I tell you something?
Yeah, of course.
What?
I've got troubles.
Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
Say what you want and you'll see --
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
Yes I do.
Just say no.
I won't say, no, wait, Claudia --
just let me walk out, ok?
Yes.
You alone in there?
Yes.
What's your name?
Claudia.
Claudia What?
-- can I get you?
Diet Coke.
It doesn't matter.
Where's Richard and Julia?
Have you ever been there?
Sure, why?
Cynthia?
What?
Not enough, what do you want?
I should maybe go to the bathroom.
Can you hold it?
I don't know.
Just hold it, you'll be fine.
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
I don't know, Richard, they need to talk it over --
Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --
We're not gonna do that now.  We're not gonna do that now and that's over.
BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT, DAD WE NEED TO GET HIS MONEY AND GO.
Son, don't --
GIVE US YOUR MONEY.
Put the gun down, please, boy.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
Son, please, now....
That idea is over now. We're not gonna do that now.
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
That's confidential information, little man.
No.
I'm a rapper.
I ain't fuckin with you --
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
Finish it up without the lip.
I was listening --
What's up?
He's doing the interview with the lady --
Fine.  Phil, you still there?
I'm about to get off the elevator --
Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
Do you have love in your heart?
Well --
No.  I mean, I'm telling you: I'm telling you that I have love.
You're a friend of the family I presume?
What?  What does that mean?
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
That's right.
Picky, picky.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
Mmm.Hmm.
You see?
Stay that way.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
Gently, son --
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
Don't Donnie. Don't do it.
Braces.
Braces?
Yes.
You don't need braces.
Yes I do.
Your teeth are fine.
It's...doesn't matter....
Don't do this, Don.
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
I've been a good worker, Solomon. A hard and loyal --
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!
GIMME YOUR FUCKIN' KEYS.
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
Do you wanna sit down?
I need to sit down.
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
Fuckin' bullshit is right, in'it?
Where is he?
I'm trying.
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
When was the last time you talked to your son?
....I dunn...o....maybe ten...five, fuck, fuck....that's another thing that goes --
I've seen it before.
Other fuckin' assholes like me.
There's no asshole like you.

Go fuck myself?
You got it.
Who are you gonna call?
Jack.
Is Jack your son?

Hi.  Is Frank there?
I think you have the wrong number.
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
No.
Is this 509-9027?
Yep.
Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
-- let's talk more about your background --
Is that still lingering?
-- just to clarify --
So boring, so useless --
Yes.
-- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
Not really.
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
She does.  From when you were a boy.
She lived in Tarzana.
What am I doing?
I'm quietly judging you.
Around here.
the valley?
And what did your parents do?
Does you mother still work?
Are you close?
She's my mother.
"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
And your father?
He passed away.
I'm sorry.
people die.
I wouldn'tve asked --
Not a problem.
And you ended up at UC Berkely --
Right.
Do you have your masters?
...this close...
In five years?
What name?  My name?
It's not your given name, right?
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
"Frank" was my mother's father.
...are you Phil...?
I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
Uh-huh.  What's going on?
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
I'm really sorry.
He's in here --?
Yeah.
It's interesting.
Mmm.
...just wait...Dad...you want something...can you say...
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
You can't just come in here.
The door was open, I got a call --
You're just come in --
Calm down.
I am calm.
Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
Are you lyin' to me?
I live alone.
Ok. What's your name?
Marcie.
I'm not askin', Marcie.
You on any medication?
No.
It's ten o'clock in the morning --
I don't have to do a god damn thing.
THAT'S NOT MINE.
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
...you know...
Did your wife find out?
No.
Then what?
Yeah. Yes.
Will you say my name?
I got in trouble at school.
Fuck no.
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
Are you alright?
It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.
I'm drinking.
Slowly or quickly?
Come home soon after the show.
She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
Did you tell her?
Love you too..
Bye.
It'll take the pain away.
It's not really pain.
No.  No.
Yeah.
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
Was there anyone that I know?
Who?
Rose, I don't --
hey.
Paula.  Ellen.
How long with Ellen?
Just once.
How long with Paula?
Two years...three years...
What about now?
Is it over 'cause you're sick?
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
Well maybe.
I don't.
I love you so much.
Maybe...I don't...
Do you know the answer to this?
...No....
I don't know.
I really don't know.
But you can't say....
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
I don't know what I've done.
Yes you do.
Hello.  Is Claudia here?
She's asleep.
Are you her boyfriend?
You're Jimmy Gator, right?
Yes.  What's your name?
I'm Bob.
You're her boyfriend?
Yeah.  She's sleeping now, I mean --
I'II go....is it...back here?
It's alright.
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.
No they don't --
I don't wanna do it.  Why can't one of you do it --
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
I'm trying to help, Linda --
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
You need to sober up.
I have to go.
Shut the fuck up.
What are you doing?
No, Linda, you don't understan --
PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.
...I don't....
818-753-0088.
Partridge?
Yeah.
What would you like?
Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
mmm.hmm.
Bottled Water?
Do you have that?
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
That's it.
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
Thank you.
What do you do?
Shut up -- shut up --
-- the fuck are you talking about?
I need this one.
Should be one-thirty.
You're late, not me.
You coulda been in front --
-- I didn't see you from the window.
Sure.
See you.
Why didn't you answer those questions?
I didn't know the answer --
Stand up.
I said I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
Why did you do this?
Hi.
..sorry...
..sorry...
It's ok.
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
I hate it.
No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
It's raining frogs from the sky.
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
This happens....this is something that happens.
God smiled upon us.
And you were not hurt?
That is good.
No, stay back!  Stay back!
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
D'Artagnan.
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
I am preparing for a ball!
I wish to discuss your brother.
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
He is your brother!
He is nothing now.
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
Shut up, knave!
I am with you!
Making the key to the throne.
Come, we have a boat waiting.
A body.
His plight is obvious, isn't it?
Tomorrow.
You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.
I have it all worked out.
And people close to him, who --
Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
Three days??!!
But -- what is Porthos doing?
But -- what is he doing?
About to hang himself, I should think.
All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal.
Hold your goblet with two fingers.
Perhaps he serves a different king.
To the Bastille.  And death.
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
You -- You cannot ask me to betray my king!  I have sworn to him!
You can't do it.
Pull them back!
Everyone back.
Forgiveness?
Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
It is also a place of burial.
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
What use am I?
We go someplace dangerous.
Why didn't you say so?
So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
Did she have tits like that?
We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
Raoul --
Athos, my friend!
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
I know.
Oh my friend.
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
Athos, I beg you --
To kill the king.
I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.
What is its antidote?
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either.
Porthos told me.
Your mother's.
She will be at the ball.
How did you --
Just... water.
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
Silence!  I order you!
Thank you, your Majesty.
It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
... tired.  Must... lie down.
Yes, your Majesty.
... You knew you had a double?
He is my brother.
My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
There.
I must insist, Sire.
I am unhurt --
No, Keeper.
Thank you, Keeper.
... Two-thirty-seven.
You may go, Lieutenant.
Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
Out directing the search for the traitors.
Shoot them!  Shoot them!
Enough of this, our dinner waits.
It's lovely.  It's just...
My dear, I've already done it.
Yeah?
Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
What do you need?
You mean shut your ass down!
Where are you?
We're by Ozone...
You set to go -
What do you think?
Alright, stay on the phone.
Did you report it stolen?
Great. Well that changes a lot...
We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -
I didn't hit shit!
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
Right behind you.
Fine -
Did you start out area six?
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
Well don't you think that's odd?
Gotta come from somewhere...
Where do you come from, Marvosa?
That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
And who are you?
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
Yeah, it was opened -  with a goddamn screwdriver!!!
I'll live...
And what did he do to the girl?
He said he was following up some lead.
Well let's get his ass to the garage!  Some lead...
Yeah?
Up north.
Where up north?
Seattle.
You got any family?
You're the mysterious type, right?
Only on dates?
You'll find out - soon enough.
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
What did you do then?
So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
No...I'm in some trouble...
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
Please...
Yeah, c'mon in...you scared the hell out of me!
I killed them.
Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
OK...where do you want to start?
Let's see what we got...
And look at the balances...these aren't police salaries...
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
Shit, we just started.  But I better log out of this.
Tubbs, these people mean business.
I'm going to need a way to get there.
Mind if I come along for the ride?
Hop in.
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
Screw him!
Not with this...
Then what did you do, play canasta?
County jail - get in.
Where is he?
It was you who did the asking.
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
I wouldn't presume to try.
I don't recommend it.
Christ!
Twenty minutes max.
At the end is the tail of what could be an 'r.
Library of Congress.
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
I'll try to keep him as far away from it as I can...
I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
Why not?
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
Last two like this we had, you caught.
I am all right.
As long as they're dead...
These are all dead, Will.
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
You said the guy down here is good.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
What do you want to do?
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
See? You do know something about him.
...I'm going to see Lecktor.
The mark? Yes.
Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
You.
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
We will feel sick for a very long time.
Wait, Will...
Get me a plane!
I'll pick you up in...
I won't be here.
When are you coming back?
When I'm done.
What?
Something Lecktor said.
What's that?
Don't talk to me!!
Have him peel the top label back.
See if there's another label underneath.
What?
Three minutes.
Stay in the trees.
Wait for the back-up! Will?
It's happening again, Jack...
He went to the men's room.
For Christ's sake get him!
Let's get to the physical.
They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
The activities of nocturnal animals.
When do you need it?
In eight days.
Dandridge is a condescending prick. Ride with me. It would be because I want you to.
In the kitchen.
Yes, are you okay...?!
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
I'll get my purse.
Francis? Where are you?
The developing room.  I need to... see you.
I'll see you later. All right?
You'll come by?
Yes.
It's me.
Who?
Me.
Francis...?
Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
Was I in an accident?
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
I don't want to know.
I'm very scared.
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
No. I don't want to see you.
Yes.
Yes.
Do you see?
Please, no.
'No' what?
Not me.
Are you a man?
Yes.
No.
You will tell the truth?
Absolutely,
Dr. Chilton.
Yes?
Yeah. It's right here.
As long as it's on soft paper.  You may...  Find this curious.
Uh... sure...
Hi, Linda. ..
Linda doesn't come in nights.
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
Thank you very much.
No. I can help you.
I don't understand.
Why do you think I called?
Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
He's right-handed.
Most people are.
He's misunderstood.
Cut the general crap.
That's true.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
What happened to them?
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
I call him a monster.
I understand he cut you pretty good...
What about the dog?
He asked how you are.
And you said?
I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
Huh?  Will? Is that you?
Hey, baby! Where are you?
At the store. You doin' some good?
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
Me, too. And very erotic...
Tell me about yourself.
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
I have to see somebody.
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
Blue is cold.
Do you remember what you said?
Yes. I said this is too good to live...
You haven't smoked in two years.
I'd like one of your cigarettes, please.
Then why?
No.
And... where are things?
I have to go back to Birmingham.
Is Crawford going with you?
Will? Are you okay?
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Will?  You could come up here.
You got a deal...
Yes. Is Molly there?
Tell her I called.
Go on to the house.
Lt. Fisk said...
Go on to the house...
Are you George Sherman?
Yes. Who are you?
My name's Will Graham. I...
Oh, Jesus... Come in.  Honey...!
Yeah...
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
I figured I'd ask you...
Are you gonna kill him?
No.
She got all right?
...after a while.
And Hobbs died?
...yes.
I got it. Thank you.
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
Yes.
Why should I tell you?
Then how did you catch me, Will?
You had disadvantages.
What disadvantage?
You're insane.
You're very tan, Will.
Yes.
Do you dream much, Will?
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
Yes. I'd considered it.
I don't have one right now.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
I haven't decided yet.
I hope you have a second chance...
Tank you veddy much.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
No.  Caspiar.
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
"No"?  "No" to which part??
I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.
I refuse.
Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.
Hi George!
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
That's alright.  Where...?
What's up?
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
Oh, you know the Bay Area!  Always foggy!
Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
You've got good days and bad days.
Yeah...
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
Oh!
Twenty!
Ten.
Deal.
Okay, great!  So let's reset!
Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
Hi... am I late?
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
No thanks.
Hi... am I late?
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
No thanks.
I'm here, ain't I?
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
If you want...
No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
It's me.
Oh, it's open.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
You don't know the real me.
Andy... there is no real you.
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
Have you told your family?
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
Okay.  You're probably right.
Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  "Maui?  "Wowie!"
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
DON'T TOUCH ME!
Then your father's a wimp.
Then your father's a wimp.
And you're just poor white trash!
What?!?
Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
So?  What do they know?
No!  Andy, don't do it --
They're asking for it.
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!
No!  NO NO NO!  None of that!  I want this show to be positive!
Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
Yes, your Holiness?
Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
Positive.
It's probably just a strained muscle.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
Er, yes.  Speaking.
"Speaking"!  Reeking, seeking, creaking... Freaking!
Kaufman's a lying bastard!  If you sign him, I'll RUIN YOU!
So your name's not Gorsky.
Don't believe everything you hear.
Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
I used to think you were original.
What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it!
Where?
There!
He said he's coming back!
Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga.
They're gonna lynch him!
Why isn't he MOVING??
What's your name?
Bob.
"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
Yes.
SHUT UP!  I hate them Polish jokes!
He'll be contacting us again.
Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
Their next target.  The name is Neo.
It's already begun.
Know what?
Hurry!
They won't make it.
And you are?
You all look the same to me.
Oh shit.
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
No way.  Not possible.
What?
Should Tank I.D. it?
Oh, God.
I know.  It's her fault.
Two grand.
I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
I know but I felt like taking a shift.
You don't, do you?
Yeah, 'course I'm sure.
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
Cypher?  Where's Tank?
He had an accident.
An accident?!
No!
He's going to pop!
No, it's all right.
What are you doing?
Midnight watch.
The Matrix?  Yeah.
... Yeah.
Five.  Since I've been here.
What happened to them?
Dead.  All dead.
How?
Any time.
I need an exit!  Fast!
Just get me outta here.
Yes.
Goddamnit!
Go.
Shit!  Apoc?
They'll be able to track it.
We have no choice.
He's beginning to believe.
Five minutes.  Maybe six.
I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.
Stand up and see for yourself.
Right now?
Yes.  Now.
Yes.
Go!  Now!
How do you know all this?
Please.  Come.  Sit.
Why not?
Be what?  Be real?
Far from it.
Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
You've never used them before.
More important than what is when?
Your training.
You -- you're too fast.
Because... I didn't think I would?
Your mind makes it real.
I think I do.
Look again.
What's going on?
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
Of the Resistance.
And she knows what?  Everything?
She would say she knows enough.
How does she know?
Yes.
What did she tell you?
That I would find the One.
Yes I do.
Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
I need the main wet-wall.
We need an exit.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
We're on our way --
Yes, sir.
Do it!
Shit, I'm sorry.
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
How do you know that name?
My name is Trinity.
Gee-zus.
What?
Most guys do.
They're watching you, Neo.
Who is?
From what?
From you.
We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
It's going into replication.
Easy, Neo.  Easy.
What?
That's different.
Is it?
Are you worried?
Should I be?
Yes.
What did she tell you?
... right as rain.
Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
What happened?  What did you see?
We can't leave him!
We have to!
Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?
I'm going in after him.
I have to.
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
Because...
I'm coming with you.
No, you're not.
Do what?
Not yet.
No.
The Oracle.
They're hacking his mind.
How?
Because I believe in something.
Duck!
Kick it in!  Kick it in!
You're not far from Cypher.
Cypher, I thought --
I'll be all right.
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
Trinity, we don't have any other choice.
What the hell just happened?
An Agent!  You have to send me back!
I don't know.  I lost him.
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Know where he is?
Follow me.
Nothing's private...
Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
That means it's good.
You got sparklers?
Well the guy over there said...
Yeah, yeah, never mind.  You gotta be careful.
All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...
Ok.  For another $5.00 a special on the packs.
Ok.  Wait here.
I gotta get the stuff.
Can't we come with you?
Uh...can we give you a check?
A check?  What the...hey, where you kids from?
Anybody wanna have a game?
'And with your spirit.'
Salute!!!
I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
Jewish...
How do you know?
She don't look Jewish.
Kennedy.
It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
Yeah.
You flew before?
I'll say that I'm travelling.
Panther!  Same thing...
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
Yeah, I'm gonna worry about you, too.
Not quite...but keep trying.
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
Giovanino!  Where have you been?
I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
Should I slap him?
What do you mean?
Didn't show up.
I could have told you that.
Cut it out stupid.  It's me.
Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
Me?  I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie...
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
I'll be here.  Don't worry.
He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Nope...
OK, get in.
Get him in.
Ok...that's it.
C'mon Johnny.
You getting out too?
Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
$20.
Charlie, this is business.
Yeah, where's the rest?
Fine.
I know.
Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
Ok.
Oh...around...why?
You heard what happened to GROPPI, eh?
Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...
Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
What was it?
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
"Francis Macomber."
Wha?
Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
Do you have enough?
Well...
I don't mind.
It's all right.
Maybe, who knows.
Charlie...?
Nobody knows anything, believe me.
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
What is it now?
Don't ask.
No.
Take your time.  I don't care.
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
You're intolerable today.
Watch your language.
Well you can't blame them in a way.
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
The girls like it loud.
Girls?  You call those skanks girls?!
I feel fine--nothing wrong with me.
Count it.
Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
 Shut up.
Sal!... fourteen street.
Come on.
This is some boat.  Your father's?
Yeah...just had it delivered...
Yeah, I think so.
I know...I know.
Well...no.
You mean it's heisted.
You could say that.
This is a heisted car!
Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
Friends of yours Michael.
Shut up.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Can you spare it?
Sure.
Thanks.
You think so?
Yeah, speak for yourself.
He's coming.
His wife?
Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
Love that name.
He's cute.
Very.
Hi, Allison --
Have you got a minute?
But it's your birthday.
And you could care less --
We've got some things to discuss.
I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
Annie made them.
It's for the party, Dad --
Oh, the goddam party --
'Goddam party'!
They respect you.  Isn't that a kind of love?
That you've been to Susan?
I wasn't going to say --
But what?
What will I tell Annie?
Red or white?
Both.
Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.
You mean this, sir?
Right away.
Hi.
What 'business'?
You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
Yeah.  Goodnight.
So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?
Am I not obligated to?
Hello, Quince.
Here...
'Here'?
Why yes, thank you.
And a glass.
"Death and Taxes"?
What an odd pairing.
Of whom?
It doesn't matter.
Then why did you bring it up?
Yes.
I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
-- And now you're going to pee some more.
What'd it say?
'Yes' to the deal?
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
No no, not you.
Do you think I need a haircut?
Bill, after this deal, you'll be able to afford one.
Me, too.
You have a way with words.
Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh -- this is --
Yes.
What do you mean?
Uh -- he's from out of town --
Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
Glad I could be of some help.
'Just kidding'?
Sit down, Drew.
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
How nice for you both.
I thought this was practically a done deal --
Please, Drew.
Yours.
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
Don't you want to hear the details?
No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
You get not to go to jail.
'It's up to Joe', huh?
Yeah, that's what he said.
Well, that's very interesting.
-- But he was concerned about the timing?
The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
That's what he said.
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
But I didn't mean to do it!
He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
Obeah evil.  I not evil.
I from dat nex' place.
Make it go 'way.
Make it time.
No, I come to see Doctor.
Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
Mine, too.
You loved back?
I am.
She knows you real self?
She knows how she feel.
Rass!
Don' need you okayin'.
Hi, Jennifer.
Nothing?
Good morning, Jennifer.
The Board is waiting.
What?
As long as it takes.
Hey, this is fun.
And you're a nice man, Quince.
You're welcome.
Confused, huh?  About what?
Love.
You love Allison, don't you?
Oh yes, I do.
How did you meet?
I'm lost.
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
I'm sorry.
Do you love Drew?
Come again?
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
I don't have any.
I can see why.
Yes?
Goodnight to you, Susan.
Then why are you here, Joe?
I came to see you.
Watch me do what?
Whatever you do.
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
And I'll be a visitor.
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
I don't mind --
Not now.
Be sorry for nothing.
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
Excuse me?
I mean I appreciate that.
And I appreciate you, too.
Has her pain abated?
Girlfriend?
No.
Gay?
No.
To bed.
'To bed'?
Yes.  I'm tired.
I said get out.
-- I guess you haven't.
I am.
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
Yes, he's tired.  I believe so.
I loved it.
More than you love peanut butter?
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
For how long?
Oh, I hope a long, long time.
I love you in an evening gown.
It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
But there's so much to tell you --
Don't.  That will come later.
Will it?
'Love will find out the way'.
'Love will find out the way'?
It's a saying.
I believe that, don't you?
Yes, that's why I said it.
I love you now, I'll love you always --
-- Yes?
Thank you for loving me.
Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
How long have I got?
You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
Not at all.
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Good night to you, Bill.
Good morning, Bill.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
It is a deal?
A 'deal'?
Yes?
Yes, Bill.
There's one to every rule.
That's what everybody says.
I understand.
What do you mean?
What's it like where I'm going?
Can you keep a secret?
Yes.
So can I.
Oh.  Okay.
No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
It's all yours.
Why didn't you stop me?
Well...I don't know.
This part I'm interested in.
Absolutely.
I don't know.
You were just curious?
What way would you put it?
You tell me, Bill.
Goodnight.
That's okay.
What's okay?
Just a manner of speaking.
Then I can't help you.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm her father!
I told you, 'watch it'.
Good.  Tomorrow, after the party.
I was just asking, Bill.
I think you heard me, Bill.
Well, they're mine now.
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
I don't expect you to.
Are you threatening me?
Get him in here.
It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's going to step aside --
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
He is --
-- An IRS man.
An offense --
Thank you.
I guess you have your reasons.
I am not a dream.
'...Yes --'
That's me.
You fill the bill, Bill.
I do?  How long will you be staying?
You should hope quite a while.
And then --?
Of course.
It just occurred to me --
I didn't ask any question.
I believe you did.
I don't!
What you were talking about.
I'm sorry, I --
It's enough now.
Please.  Talk to me --
I think you know --
Know what?  Know what, goddammit!
I'm here.
Time.
I'm sorry --
Yes, Bill.  The question.
Good morning, Quince.
How're you doing--?
I'm doing great.  You ready?
I am, this is it.  B Day.
How's that, Quince?
Yeah.  Or the week after.
Yeah, I give a shit.
See.  There.  What'd I tell you?
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
Sir, I'll deliver the package.
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
I'm going to stick it out here.  We still have a shot.
Hi, honey.
Drew told me.
Does Drew tell you everything?
I hope so.
You like him, don't you?
Yeah.  I guess so.
...Then don't.
You're only six-five once.
I am.  With you.
I know it's none of my business --
You mean like you loved Mom?
Uh oh --
What were you going to say?
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
Nothing.  I'm sorry.
Nothing.
Yer damn right.
What?!
Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
Will it?...
Yeah, it's good to get together.
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
It's something.
Joe?
I don't know.
I don't know, I can't say --
I'm having a helluva time.
Yes, but --
That's why it's okay.
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
The fireworks are about to start.
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
You and 'Honey'?
Nothing lasts.
I agree --
Why?
'Her'.
I've got patients coming in --
Did I say something wrong?
No, it was so right it scares me.
No --
Y'didn't?
But we've got time.
That's it.
I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
What can I do for you, Leonard?
I'm sorry... um... ?
Burt.
I have no memory.
Amnesia?
What's it like?
That must suck. All... backwards.				 *
Couple days.
So you're holding my calls?
As requested.
Seen you together, that's all.
What?
No, let's go.
Then why is this my handwriting?
When was I in here?
You're still paying for it. It's still Your room.
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
That's right I did, didn't I?
Who did this to you?
Don't be too hard on yourself.
Thanks.
Where'd you get it?
Interested in buying one?
Do you remember me?
Yeah, I remember you.
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
Take the money and walk away!
Is that what your little note says?
Why?
It's isolated.
I wasn't helping you for money.
Don't remember.
Yeah. You?
What?
What happened?
Who did he go to meet?
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
What are you gonna do?
I'll go see him.
And? 
My wife used to call me Lenny.
Yeah, I hated it.
This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.
I told him about your car.
Somebody's come. Already.
What does he want?
No!
What's this all about?
Don't protect him.
I'm not.
Help me.
How?
Kill him. I'll pay you.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
About your whore of a wife?
Why not?
Thanks.
Sweet.
Dying.
What?
I remember my wife dying.
What do you want?
A BEER, please.
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
Well, that's me.
Oh. But haven't we met before?
How do you know about me?
My boyfriend told me about you.
Who's your boyfriend?
Jimmy Grantz. Know him?
My name's Leonard.							 *
Did Teddy send you?
I don't know.
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
Then why are you here?
It's good.
You've read it a hundred times.
I enjoy it.
Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please.
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
That's who you were, you don't know who you are.
I guess I've told you about my condition.
You're in a playful mood.
Mr Gammell?
Lenny, is that you?
John Gammell?
You said you were leaving town.
Guess I've told you about my condition.
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
No! Should I?
I might have fallen asleep before I did.
No. No, just let me think for a minute.
Why?
I'll ride with him. You follow.
Give me your keys.
What's wrong with this one?
I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
Teddy. Your buddy.
Prove it.
Why not?  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
Why are you following me?
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
Wouldn't be appropriate.						*
That, and your thing.						   *
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
You exposed him for what he was: a fraud.
Are you sure?
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
Yes, I will.
Somehow, I'll know!
You won't remember!
I thought so too! I was sure you'd				* remember. But you didn't.					    *
Why would I do that?						    *
You can't just take it!
Lemon or lime?
You in Miami workin' on your complexion...?
Doing...?
What's your twenty?
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
We know these people...!
Grieve elsewhere.
And...?
"And" what?
Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...
It's a rip and a hit.
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
We're not certain!
I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
Yes you do...
I got to talk to my ADO...
I got the item.
Two main players plus three.
My end?
25% discount on the load.
Make it 40%.
Make it 35.
Deal.
When?
Okay.
Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."
I'm a fiend for mojitas.
It goes very fast.
Show me...?
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
Havana.
Later!  Do you dance?
I dance...
No.
I insist.
To mothers.  And all that we owe them...
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
...and therafore there is no consequence?
Cost less.  That's the point.
Is it December?
What do you mean?
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Zero risk.
'Cause you don't lose loads?
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
Hola, viejo.
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
What's the best fortune you ever got?
In Kowloon, once, I got one that said, "Live now because life is dust."
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe sooner.
Of course.
Where would I go?
A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
I'll be on board by noon.
Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites.
I know.  And now?
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
Hello, Miss Ukraine...
Stevens?
Something's wrong.
Transpo?  How they bringing the loads in...?
What happened to the last transporter you <u>had</u>?
Nothing.
Port-Au-Prince.
Five minutes...
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
Good.  So let's go...
Nothing.
On my way back...
Verdado.
Verdado where?
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
Havana, Cuba...?
We're makin' moves on each other.
So we want to change-up the mission statement.
Chill out Sonny.
As in...?
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
I am asking.  You to me.
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
Twenty on my man...
You're giving away your money, fool...
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
This is Agent James Fujima.
Detective Crockett.
What's your Miami PD badge number?
Okay.  What's up?
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
We don't know.
To recruit you.
Sonny...?
Yeah.
Where's Riccardo?
On the phone.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...
Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
They had me from the gate.
I don't understand...
Goodbye.
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
White supremacist types.
They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
Yeah.
You sure?
Yes.  What's up?
...and thanks for the flowers.
What flowers?
What's it say?
"Salutations from the south..."
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
Not French registry?
You set this up!
Do we need this...?
I had to lay eyes on you.
It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
Alonzo...
What...?
The Statue of Liberty.
Beg pardon, ma'am?
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
You sure you heard what I said?
Funny thing, you mentioning money. I was just about to ask your for some...
Lotta rich women back there...
Yeah?
Men, they mostly faggots.
Must be some mess back there.
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
Sure you're all right?
I know. Scribbage!
Y -- what in hell starts with Y?
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
Same all around! For my friend, too!
For money.
For money for what?
I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?
Oh hell, forget it.
Okay, right, right, okay. Another subject. Where you living? Still at the hotel?
What's that supposed to mean?
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
Oh. Guess I got the wrong impression.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?  And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
Who'd you ever do a favor for? You just let some poor bastard freeze to death, wouldn't you?
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
Can he smell the difference, eh?
Don't need a comb.
Few dozen cooties won't kill me, don't guess.
Twenty bucks...
I'm scared.
What of?
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
They gotta be.
How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
Shee-it. You believe all you read?
You're what?
Hell, don't cry about it!
Get outta my way.
You're wasting your time. There's nothing in there.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
Ready for hard work, son?
Ready for anything.
Instant V-goddam-D.
You got it.
No. You got it.
... and taxi fare for me.
Get lost.
Getchmis...?
History, man, history. How much?
Two kilos.
Where?
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
KNOCK IT OFF!
What?
You want to split your hernia again?
How's your hernia?
Don't make me laugh.
Nah, just covered with batshit!
Ziat!
Billy?
Everything.
Don't worry about it.  Right now money doesn't count. Okay?
Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.
The Hilton.
How do you like it?  Istanbul?
Sure.
How far?
About ten kilometers.
Sixty Lira?
Sixty?
How much?
Yes.  I think so.
Just what?
Something like that. Cigarette?
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
How much did you figure to make?
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
What's your father do?
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
Be tough on 'em.
Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
About as good as it looks.
What did he do?
Twelve years.
A hundred grams.
It's not fair!
Aslan, there... 
Hello.
Get the... midnight... express.
I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
Yeah.
Jimmy?
Two thirty.
What?  You gotta be joking.
After we're outside the kogus?
Oh we... we...
Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire...
Cut his fucking throat.
Whose?
I want to cut his throat.
It's already been cut.
What?
Max - where?
You can't take anything seriously.
You're right.
My passport!
No!
Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
You're ayip!
Work, work, work, that's all do
I don't hear you bitch about the money.
Mr. Yesil.
Who?
The lawyer?
Who got the Frenchman out?
What's your name?
Jeremy...
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
Tell them to send flowers to the usual address.
Yeah...?
There's some weird shit here.
Weird shit...?
And a right.
Right.
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
No, you talkin' at me.
20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-
You got a better way up?
Oh, man, there you go again.
Just do it!
Oh, Jesus!!
"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
The kid's with them!!
What do you-?
Hurry, the woman needs help!
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
What?
Across both tracks!!
This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?
You did!
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
You know what I mean...
Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
Don't you get it? It's more than that.
Maybe they lied to you.
So?
No, there's...
Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!
No such thing, baby.
I was just late.
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
Toss the flare down!
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's not like them!
What-
Just do it!!
It worked before...
The scent won't last...
Jump in.
Your arm, you can't...
I can.  We can do this...
Ah...
Talk to me.
Peter...
We can do it!
You the bug lady, right?
Gross. What is it?
No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
She used a baster.
No shit.
Fuck! It broke the skin...
What?
I know.  Help me get a sample.
Anything you can tell me might help.
It's right this way.
I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way...
How long...?
What are they...?
They're called Novril--they're for your pain. 
If you wouldn't mind.
I don't have a title yet.
What's it about?
Nothing.
No, what is it?
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
The profanity bothers you?
It has no nobility.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
My pleasure.
I know how that can be.
Done?
Yeah, thanks.
No problem.
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
Then who did?
Yes.
No big deal.
So you've indicated. Do it.
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
It'll only take a second.
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
I can't write this anymore.
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
What?
Nothing.
Not even a hint?
Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.
It looks wonderful. And so do you.
Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
You really think so?
The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
No, I haven't.
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
Three more chapters to go.
Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
Paul, this will be our legacy.
It will.
You don't know?
I'm almost done.
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
Four or five days ago. Why?
Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff.
What? What is it?
They're hauling Misery into court.
That's nice.
Oh, I like that tone.
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
It's good you found it.
There's that spice again.
He's your client, huh?
Yes, he is.
G'bye, Ms. Sindell.
Buster.
Answer me a couple things?
If I can.
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
No, the typing kind.
Oh. That kind. Nothing odd about that.
Yeah. They're in the semis.
Here it is.  Very first copy.
I am. Well, maybe not completely--
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
On what.
How do you that.
Magic...
Ahh..
Mmmm.
And my room?
Oh, I am.  Later..
I suppose I did.
What else?
Well, that's good, isn't?
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again.
An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i>
Where?
And you're happy about that?
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
In other words, you're calling her a flake.
In any case we don't want your cash.
Then we got'em!
..in the building...
I hope there's a place to land.
We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
And the check's in the mall.
He's heading down the stairs, now..
How much longer before you can reach him?
Five and a half minutes.  He's breached the hot zone..
No.  Should I?
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh?
I see.  You're not just another pretty face..
Oh, either way works for me.
Far right.
- torque wrench.
- this is very disconerting..
Do what?
Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
Your help?  What are you talking about?
Ethan Hunt.
Care to wait a decent interval?
Who wants to be decent?..
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
They've got a book for this?
They've got a book for everything.
That they're lying.
Damn, you're beautiful.
That's because I'm on my back.
There's nearly 2 million in London.
And six billion in the world.
I'd like a little more conviction..
So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
Can you think of a better one?
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
Just like old times.
Just like old times?
Just about..
Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
Oh Ethan!..
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
Like?
Then you do think it was Ambrose.
Excuse me?
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
No.  I can't afford to be curious.  And neither can you, Hunt..
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
..not in time to save him.
You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.
I'm fine..
Why not?
Yep.
Roger that.
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
I told her to get outta there.
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
Copy.  She's only got twenty-eight minutes left.  Track ahead and pick her up.
Good job.  And thanks.
What's happening here?  You're dead!
Do I?
They'll kill me.
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev...
Yes, Anatoly, yes.
S.O.P..
Hes putting on a show, Barnes.
What kind of show.
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
All ten million.
Fold it.  Fold it tight.
Always.
May take a little time.
We got it.  On your feet.
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
I'm walking.
Talking's good, walking's better.
No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
There was nobody on the bridge.
What happened to Jim?
Take off your coat.
What?
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Who is they, who is they?
I'm going to answer it.
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
Sure...
I didn't say that.
You didn't have to.........
I just need you to be safe.
What about you?
I'm going to try and get some sleep.
Bastard!
Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
This stuff is so sticky.
Claire.
Go secure.
Theyre dead.
Whos dead?
Dont <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
One hour.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
Who else is left?
Why was there another team?
I don't quite follow you.
Certainly Ethan.
Information.
What kind?
Profitable.
You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- <u>with</u> the artificial intelligence Risk chip --
Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
Now I want you to hold onto it.
What makes you trust me?
About what?
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
Why don't you come back with me?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
I need one hundred thousand dollars.
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
On what?
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
Why, may I ask?
That's the question I want to ask Job.
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
Do you <u>want</u> to blow the fire through the whole building?
IMF mainframe.
Where exactly is it?
In Langley.
We'll see.
Time up.
We're not outta here yet.
My contact is extremely shy.
What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
Jack.
Always.
Just don't chew it.
I didn't touch it.
Give me a break, Pops.
Stairway, youre wrapped, go to transport.
Higher.
Right, right.  Good.
What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
Jim.  Jim.  Hes in the open.
Jim we cant.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
No, were going to recover the disk, understand?!  Now move!
You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
Then what am I doing here?
Very well.
I'd say you've got about two minutes.
Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
Why not?
He's our guy.
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
Can you lose him?
No.  Abort.
<u>Negative</u>, Golitsyns on the move.
About two hundred yards from the bridge.
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
I remember..
How did Kittridge do it?..
Whats going to make him do that?
What he didnt get in Prague.  The NOC list.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
I usually am.
And get a doctor.
Good luck.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Why don't you take a look?
Jack...that's spying.
That's what we do isn't it?
Jack you're so wicked.
I think I might just take that look.
And a lonely ass.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
This wasnt what we discussed.
Connection denied.
Its not working.
Run it through from the top.
Phew!  Weve got five minutes...
No, I'm going.
The Shawfish?
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
We will both have the Salad Ticino.
And I'll have the special fish.
I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
Again? Johnny Cammareri.
You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo.
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
Rita. Pass the wine.
Why you drinking so much?
What?
You're welcome.
I'm going to bed now.
His brother.
And go to confession.
No. You were there.
Hello, Mr. Castorini.
You're not sleepy?
Ti amo.
You look tired.
What's your news?
I'm getting married.
Again?
Yeah.
What killed him?
He got hit by a bus.
I won't come.
Yeah.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
Let's go tell your Mother.
I got it done.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Who is this man? You're engaged!
You're married.
Alright. I didn't see you here.
I don't know whether I saw you or not.
I like your dress.  It's very bright.
I don't know. I got a feeling.
I'm wearing your bracelet.
Good morning, Lucy.
You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.
He's in Palermo.
What's wrong can never be made right. 
Let me come and talk to you.
Why?
You are going to marry my brother?
Yes. Do you want...
I have no life.
Excuse me.
Maybe I should come back another time.
But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
I'm making you a steak.
I know that. I do what I want.
I like it well done.
You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
Loretta.
Where'd Johnny find you?
He knew my husband who died.
How'd he die?
Bus hit him.
Fast.
Instantaneous.
When you get engaged?
Yesterday.
Why what?
I don't know.
Stupid.
How many men since then?
Just Johnny.
Stupid yourself.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
You think so?
Yes.
I'm telling you your life!
Stop it!
No!
Because I have no Luck!
A wolf without a foot!
Where are you taking me?
To the bed.
Me neither.
I was dead.
Get all of me. Take everything.
What about Johnny?
That light.
I've never seen a moon like that.
What?
Take it easy.
I'm marrying your brother!
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
You don't get along with anybody!
What did you do?
What did I do?
You ruined my life.
Why not?
I'm in love with you!
I can't!
I'm telling you you can't.
But he wants me to come!
But that's cause he don't know!
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
Alright. Where's the Met?
Hi.
You look beautiful. Your hair...
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
Kinda gaudy.
For what?
Come on.
It's the best thing there is.
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
Yeah.
I think that's it.
I wanna go home.
Yeah. It smells like snow.
How can you ask me that?
You're making me feel guilty again.
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
I know what I know.
I'm here!
We're here.
That's right.
This is where we're going!
Yeah.
I'm really afraid.
Why?
I was.
And you're not now?
No.
Let me go home.
No.
I'm freezing to death.
Is Johnny here?
No. I'm gonna wait.
I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me!
What!
Will you marry me.
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Yeah, I'll be in.
Hi.
No?
Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too.
She was too young for him.
Never is a long time.
I shouldn't.
Will you marry me?
What?
Will you marry me?
Bobo, take the cart away.
This is a good suit.
Seven-thirty.
A week. Two weeks. No more.
Then let's set the date.
A month from today?
Yeah.
You've made me very happy, Johnny.
He's my younger brother.
You have a brother?
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
WHAT?
I must ask for that back.
Where's the ring?
No.
Why not?
Pop don't like Johnny.
I got married before, you didn't sell.
And we'll sell the house.
Where you been?
I don't wanna talk about it.
Cosmo's cheating on me.
What! How do you know?
Well. I don't really know where to start.
Everything's different.
Are you drunk?
No. Are you drunk?
No. But I have a hangover.
Where's pop?
No more he's not.
He's with his dying mother!
She recovered.
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Oh God, that's too bad.
What's the matter with him?
Did you see it?
No.
Oh.
That's a pretty big sin.
You should think about this.
I know.
I don't know.
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
I came right from the airport.
Come on in.
Where is she?
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
My mother's recovered.
You're kidding?
Yes.
I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
I don't know.
No idea.
Johnny...
Of course I want to.
It was a miracle!
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
And you are a son who doesn't love his mother!
Do you have a girlfriend?
It's nothing!
I'm not disturbed. By you.
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
She was just too young for you.
Will you join me for dinner?
Are you sure?
That woman was a student of yours?
I'll remember that. What do you do?
I'm a housewife.
Then why are you eating alone?
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
Why do men chase women?
Nerves.
Yes.
Yes.
People home.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
Good night.
You mean the whole house?
Yes.
My God, it's a mansion!
It's a house.
Well. That explains it.
What? What?
Look.
Oh.
It's Cosmo's moon.
Cosmo.
I don't know.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
I don't know! That moon! That crazy moon Cosmo sent over!
You see that moon last night?
I knew she had it.
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
Bring her forward.
Did you dress her up like this?
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
Does wood sink in water?
Bread?  No, no, no.  Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...
Yes!
You're using coconuts!
...What?
Through ... We found them.
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
Well, this is a temperate zone.
Not at all.  They could be carried.
What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
I'm not interested.
He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
The Britons.
Who are the Britons?
All of us are ... we are all Britons.
Well, who is your lord?
We don't have a lord.
What?
Well, I didn't vote for you.
You don't vote for kings.
Well, how did you become king, then?
Who are they?
Oh!
NI!   NI!
Oh!
We want ... a shrubbery!
A what?
Ni!  Ni!  Ni ... Peng ... Nee ... Wum!
You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
Of course.
And not too expensive.
Now - go!
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
What, "is"?
No, no ... not "is"!
What?
None shall pass.
So be it!
'Tis but a scratch.
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
No, it isn't.
I've had worse.
You're a liar.
Come on you pansy!
What?
Look!
What!  Just a flesh wound. 
Stop that.
Had enough ... ?
I'll have your leg.
You'll what ... ?
Come Here.
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
Well, what are you then?
My liege ... forgive me ...
Bedevere, my Liege.
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
That's it.  Ni!  Ni!
No.  No.  No!
Just keep me covered.
What does it say?
Yes, my liege.  Stand by for attack!!
Oh, just some friends!
There are some who call me Tim?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
Greetings King Arthur.
You know my name?
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
A G...g...g...
A Grail?
Yes, I can help you with your guest.
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
What?
There he is!
There.
It is the rabbit.
... You silly sod.
What?
I warned you!
Who did we lose?
Man!
What?
:Well - I can't just say:  "Hey, Man!'
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
You didn't bother to find out, did you?
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
Yes, I see.
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.
Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
Course it's a good idea.
The nose?
Why do you think she is a witch?
I'm not dead!
I'm getting better!
Do me a favour.
My name is Sir Launcelot.
What is your quest?
To find the Holy Grail.
Blue.
Right.  Off you go.
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
What is your quest?
To seek the Grail!
What is the capital of Assyria?
I don't know that!
Here's one!
Ninepence.
Yes he is.
I can't take him.
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
Thursday.
That's all right.  See you on Thursday.
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
And another!
Good Concorde ... stay here and rest awhile.
Farewell, Concorde!
Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
They cost fifty pounds each!
Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
Father, lad.
I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
Listen, Alice ...
I'm ... your son ...
Not you.
I was saved at the last minute.
Well ... I'll tell you ...
Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
Leaving the room ... yes.
Got it?
Yes?
If we ... er ... 
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
Until you, or anyone else ...
No, not anyone else - just me.
Just you ...
And make sure he doesn't leave.
Make sure he doesn't leave.
The Prince ... ?
We're coming with you.
What is your name, handsome knight?
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.
Camelot ...
Oh ... hello ...
Quick!
Why?
You are in great peril.
We'll cover your escape!
Look - I'm fine!
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
... I Bet you're gay.
No, I'm not.
Ector.
We must examine you.
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
Please ... we are doctors.
Back to your bed!  At once!
I'm sorry, I must go.
Well ... yes ...
You've come to rescue me?
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
He's come to rescue me, father.
Well, let's not jump to conclusions ...
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
Look.  I'm warning you.
What's he do?  Nibble your bum?
Shut up.
Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
I didn't.
No, no, no.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
I speak as I find, Archie.
Not down south you don't.
I think he nearly ruptured his truss.
Seventy a year.
Not bad, not bad.
How about yourself?
Sixty.
It's only grief makes her like she is.
Three years, John.  Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
Come on, man.  There's love and there's ...
You know what I mean.
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
The good-looking one.
Aye, but will they?
John, it's not your problem what she eats.
I'm getting dressed.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
I've got my duties to attend to.
She'll get over it.
I can't let her down now, Archie.
She means it.
It's a diary.
Be careful who sees it.
What do you take me for?
I can't move to tidy.
It's what the maids are for.
I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
Mary Taylor, sir.
I hope to go up next year.
Louder, girl!
Checked and locked, sir.
Kitchen and lower house.
Mr Brown, sir --
Are you all right, Barney?
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
I beg your pardon?  Mama...?
She's busy.
Convey her a message.
Do you know who you address, sir?
Whom you address.
The future King!
Out of my way!
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
It's so infernally cold in here.
Cold is good--  Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
It is quite late enough.
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
My own.
Back and upper corridors.
I'm sorry?
You'll be sent a message.
Who'll bring it to me?
Her Highness' Equerry.
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
In matters concerning the Household, I act on her behalf.
Yes.  I do.
I beg your pardon?
Is that the Queen's request?
That can wait till the weekend.
There are important papers from --
It can wait.  Anything else?
Don't think I can't persuade her.
I am a blank sheet.
Do you hunt?
Occasionally.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
If you hunt, you kill.
You're injured.
It's nothing.
Oh.
Surely --
Was there never ambition?
Maybe, once.
Then I envy yo.
Why?
For Her Majesty.
Aye.
I said.  I serve the Queen.
No other aspiration?
Why do you think I keep her here?
She trusts you, John.
They aren't as watchful as you.
Too busy looking after themselves.
The greasy pole.
No loyalty.
No love.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
In time, she will.
She'll think I betrayed her.
Ma'am.
You are here safely.
Aye, ma'am.
You are well?
I am.
And the pony?
She's well, too.
I'm glad of it.
Yes, ma'am.
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
He thought so, yes.
Yes.
What?
Those, over there, there.
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
I am told so.
Who by?
What does he know about the Highlands?
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
That doesn't make him an expert.
Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
Of course I shall say what I have to say.  I always do.
To keep out the cold.
Aye.
I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
Yes, ma'am?
Has someone seen to those bruises?
Yes, ma'am.
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
Because I have to! 
Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
I came as quickly as I could.
Oh, several things.
Is that not enough?
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
Well, both.
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
I hope he got his mother's permission.
To know when he'll be king.
You can't know that for sure.
Mrs Brown.
What's her excuse this time?
Excellent!
Not too protracted, I hope.
Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
Cold is good!
Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
Yes, ma'am.
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
Has he been hurt?
A few days, ma'am.
Why was I not told earlier?
I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
Of course, at once.
Again?
Read it!
I have no idea.
Why not?
What is it?
I have a letter, ma'am.
From whom?
My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
Why is he not here?
Then why are you not with him?
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.
Yeah, who isn't.
Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
He?
And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
How'd you know it was us?
You don't like it?
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
Why don't we take this into my office.
What the hell does that mean?
Did you play ARCADE last night?
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
Hey, kid.
We are talking...
I'm coming over.
I'm in the middle of it...
Turn if off!
Laurie's.
Let's go around back.
What?!
We can't...
My house.  I want to try something.
What?
...but then it hits the relay stations...
Right.  And then communication satellites, and then anywhere.
The Police, then...
And beat it at it's own game.
Drives 'em crazy every time.
I can't believe you made it!
Everything.
Yeah.  The Inferno.
You didn't hear me?
Yes I am...
I know.  It sucks.
We're actually inside, aren't we?
One.  In case...
Don't even say it.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
You've got the schematics, check.
Check your read-out.
What?!  There's nothing here!
Look around...
Screamer.
We don't have a choice!
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
I don't want to talk about it.
There never is.
So tell me you're okay, then.
Sure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever.
Well, it's a long story...
Thought so.
Then we'll go home.
That way.
In this world, wrong is right!
Oh God...oh god...
Is that your question?
Wait!  No!  That's not it!
You have no time.
Of course I am.
The game will guide you.
Sign me up.
Fucked up.  That's what they said I was.
I am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take you?
Give her a chance, will you?
What's going on, Cynthia?
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
What did you say?
They fired everyone.
Who fired everyone?
I know.  Where are you Adam?
What do you mean "you know"?
You're broke!
But I'm not broke.
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
It's been a very strange day.
Will you meet with him?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
Git along little dowgie and call me back.
There is no problem.
I'll speak to someone.
Howdy to you.
Yeah.
What did I say?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
You're an understandin' fella.
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
I told ya.
Wow!
I was afraid of that.
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
Good luck, honey!
Are you okay?
Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
Yes.
Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
Can you tell me what happened?
No. I can't.
Was anyone hurt?
May I have your name please?
Diane?
Number 17.
But it said #12.
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
Oh...
But, this could be serious.
No...I need to sleep.
If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
I don't know who I am.
What do you mean? You're Rita.
You don't remember anything else?
Mulholland Drive?
Not that I can see.
We'll take our check.
Maybe it's not me.
I'm not sure about this.
"Then they'd put you in jail."
Those men in front, in the car.
No... but...
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
And who are we auditioning for today?
My next delivery is up that way, so I'll be getting down to it real soon.
Okay. Why this Denny's?
Go ahead.
You see what I mean...
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
Yeah.
That's what I'm thinkin'.
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
Hardly.
Not a coke or anything?
Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
No...
Great ! You couldn't be a fan of Dolphins or some other less threatening animal.
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
Jesus, my legs are asleep. I'll never be able to win this shit.
I have an embezzler and his accomplice.
Please don't be alarmed, Ma'am.
No time. Get him up.
Leave him, he's dead.
No !
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
I don't know.
We wait. This is an elevator.
We have to climb up that.
Give me a fucking.....
I'm working on it.
It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
Why would he ? His parents are rich.
We drown.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
Excuse me ?
Is this really the time ?
Do you have something better to talk about ?
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
Fine...
You don't. It's random, there no trick.
The Brooklyn Bridge.
Girder, watch your head.
I work here, remember ?
That was eleven years ago.
Yeah a real shame.
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
Just shut the fuck up.
I don't help criminals.
Not quite....
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
A dragon.
Are you hunting wabbits ?
You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
Look pipsqueak, I'm having a real bad day here and we're just starting.
Look...
What the fuck are you talking about.
Ow...
Thanks...
Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
What ?
Don't eat at the console.
What ? Are you my mother ?
But, he's...
Got it.
When will that be ?
When you are ready.
He probably has a history of this shit.
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
I'm sick of playing. I've got a better idea.
For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
Excuse me, sir ?
I am thirty two.
And how much do we pay you annually ?
Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
Sir ?
Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
No. I am not a homosexual.
Then what do you want ?
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
Bruce has just awaken.
What ?????
I don't know.....
We can't afford too many surprises.
Yes. I think he's feeling sick or something.
I can see that but where ?
What happened ?
How can this happen ?
Yeah, right. He's stuck all the way over here
I meant him.
Really ? On a date ?
Yes.
Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
Hi. I brought some wine.
Thank you.
Wake up, we're in trouble.
I just need to sit and think for a second.
Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
We just having our first date when you showed up.
Nothing.
Zach from work ?
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
Where are we ?
Who was that guy anyway ?
Hey buddy. You okay ?
I'm going to go ahead and go now.
Good morning.
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
Are you writing a poem?
Oh, just put it over there.
Ohhhhh.
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
Your Uncle Phil told me.
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
This is California, anything is possible.
Don't mention it.
I don't even know your name.
I would do it again in a minute.
What about living in the real world pal?
Could you hold on for a second? 
Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch.
Okay thanks, atta girl.
Well you know what I mean.
So, what's on your mind?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you Vada.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
Seriously.
Great.
It's just a question, it's not about anybody.
Her favorite poet.
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
What??
Thanks, I needed that.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Have fun.
Hi Dad.
Hi honey.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
Totally groovy huh?
Totally.
I love you too sweetie, bye.
Give my love to Shelly.
She just had a baby that's all.
We have a baby?
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Well you should at least try a little bit.
Then I'll throw up a little bit.
How about a nice glass of milk?
And some taco chips so I can dunk.
You're being narrow-minded.
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
I really think we're going overboard for just a simple school assignment.
I was pushing as fast as I could.
Maybe he's hungry.
Oh.  Ohhh?
What're you saying?
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
Maggie...Maggie's little girl.
You mean, you knew about me?
I'd like to, thanks.
You are?
Yeah, come on, let's talk.
More than anything in the world.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
Come on in!
That's okay.
It's just a corpse.
I know that.
Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
See you? He can smell you from there.
Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
He likes you.
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
Well if it isn't Vada, the grasshopper girl.
No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
Hi.
Then I have come to the right place.
I guess you have.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
Rose.
It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
Happy hunting.
You're Alfred Beidermeyer aren't you?
Your mother?
I never met my mother.
Give it back Nicholas!
But we made a business deal.
What ever happened to a good old-fashioned favor huh?
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
There's water in your bathroom.
I want juice!
Don't wake up Vada.
I won't.
You're over reacting!
No THANKS!
Yeah, RIGHT.
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
WHAT??
Get married?
Why do you argue with everything I say?
Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
You would.
May I use the phone please.
He is one of the great poets.
At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
Does it work?
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
I want it back now. I never should have taken it off, I want it back.
Give it to me!
Come and get it.
Just give it to me!!
Just come and get it...right here!
DON'T, come on!!!
DON'T!!!
Uh oh...
In the tar??
Owh...
Leave me alone!!
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
Here's Judy Garland!
Really?
And you'd be my cousin?
Yeah I guess...sort of.
But we wouldn't really be related right?
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
Part adventure...part miracle.

No?
Good-bye, look in your backpack.
Ten bucks.
What's it for?
For the mini-bike fund.
Wow!
Was Rose.
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?
Rose this not the place to be having this...
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.
This is it I guess.
I should do this myself.
Sounds like you're very organized.
Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
Phil for God sake.
You know where the fire extinguisher is.
No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
You know how I feel about you.
Yeah...right, it's pointless to worry.
Bye Niece, Vada.
Nothing, nothing at all.
I mean...with your car.
I was commenting on your hair.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Well maybe for you.
Something wrong?
Well, even without anesthesia I always tell my patients to...eh... to relax.
Well I'm sort of involved.
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
I bet your mom sang to you.
Is there milk in them already?
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
Oh Vada she's so beautiful.
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
What do you mean?
It would be fantastic.
But Dad'll never go for it.
You leave your father to me.
Hey! Oh look.
He's so tiny.
You have no idea.
He's a great poet.
He is?
Do you know him?
Vada!!
Good for you baby.
Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
All right, here.
WHAT?
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
You told everybody where you were going, I'm here for the motor home.
What?
I'm impressed.
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
No.
It's there.
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
The bee stings! I can't breathe!
I think it's still available.
Yes they are.
Stiffs??
I need the job.
Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
Well the other night at dinner...
Oh that, she just likes to play.
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
It's no big deal.
No. Just, more activity.
Oh, how do you mean?
I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
It's nice.
Are you mad at me?
No, why?
This is where we are.
Is there enough room?
In ages, I know, me neither.
Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.
Kiss me.
Good.
It's only eight o'clock.
Goodnight Shelly.
Goodnight.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
Okay.
Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
Is it really your camper?
Did you ahh, love him?
I would never marry anybody I didn't love.
Ya, that rack holds six ties.
Is it for a child?
Then who's it for?
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
I love this guy! 
Dad??
The money?
Ahh, maybe next summer.
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
You never cared before.
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
She likes to play bingo.
Can I go too?
No, sweetie, not yet.
Soon honey, soon.
Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!
Hi.
What are you doing.
Feeding my fish.
I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
Why not?
He's okay isn't he?
There were just too many of 'em.
Get away, get away!!
What??
What was my mama like?
I'm very nervous.
Why?
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
Hi, is Vada home?
Thank you. Bye.
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about you Thomas J?
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
This is one big house for one single person.
Well, you never can tell...  I might get a pet. 
Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
Thirty five dollars.
What do you get for that?
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
For this class?
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
I wrote a poem too.
Please.
Oh, Vada...
Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
Do you think she is?
No.
Does he love her?
Probably.
Do you like her?
Yes it is.
That's really cool.
Oh.
I am.
Chocolate?
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
My ball, I lost my ball.
Come on sweetie.
Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.
Thomas?
Uh huh.
What are they about?
Mostly love, and romance.
No, I'm divorced.
Can I use your bathroom first?
No.
A girl's always gotta look her best.
I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
No.
Come here, sit down.
Uh huh, why?
Oh great!!
Yes!!
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
Where's Daddy?
Well he just left, what's wrong?
I'm hemorrhaging.
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I don't want, I don't need your help....
I'm eleven and a half.
Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
Okay, get in to bed.
I'm allergic to it.
To chocolate?
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
They're just fun to read.
I can't, I have to go home.
Oh wow, a real evil canieval.
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
She only wants to do it because her sweetie pie's the teacher.
Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!
Hurry!
I'm trying.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Naah, I don't wanna.
You could pick that scab on your arm.
It's a mosquito bite.
It'll bleed.
Okay, OW!
No.
What's wrong with your eyes?
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
Come on, it's fun.
What?
You have no personality.
Hey, where does it say that?
Never mind.
Yes.
Who's that with your Dad?
It's my mother.
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
What do you think it's like?
Heaven.
Don't DO that!!
Sorry.
I told you i'll get in trouble.
I am not.
Bed wetter!
I stopped that!
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
Go???
You're right, let's knock it down.
What do you want it for anyway?
For their meat.
I am running faster!!
Hurry!!!
But I have my clothes on!
Do it!
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
Sure.
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
Bye Ma.
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
I do, she's real funny.
He likes her better than me.
Then go home, baby.
You can come to my house for dinner?
Okay, seeya.
I dunno..
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Like they do on TV?
Uh huh.
No.
Here, practice on your arm like this.
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
Close your eyes.
Okay, okay.
Okay on the count of three.
Umm, Ummmmm
Just, hurry.
Well, let's spit on it.
Okay.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
What?
Would you think of me?
For what?
Well, then, I'll take it up with her.
You should look like you dressed yourself.
I honestly wish I could...
Part of being a New Yorker.
If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.
Plus some guys whose food I don't like.
... I don't send you men, anymore. You don't know what to do with them.
Desperate.  To talk.
Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
We're about to find out.
I have a suggestion...
I can see why.
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
When I'm talking to children.
Go figure you.
You've been working on this, huh?
Sure.
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
Let's not get carried away.
I wish.
Try less appropriate.
Ben Gay.
That was Thursday.
I can't even say it.
It's too late to start over.
Major.  Dish.
Manicure...
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
To belong to someone.
Oh, you're more than okay.
Can you watch the road?
See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.
... you want a menage on your wedding night.
Uh.  How about promoting a bridesmaid?  Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
... you hate weddings, you never go.
... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?
A trademark move, don't touch it.
But he sure can kiss.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
Let me rephrase that...
I was gonna predict that.
You win.
... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
I just think you're wrong, is all.
Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
... whatever is manly and independent.
Exactly.
Exactly what?
Only.  If he wants to.
He won't get mad, huh?
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
What with the psychosis and all, yeah.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
Have you ever heard of. Irony?
... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey.  Prob'ly with Michael, doin' the nasty.
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
It doesn't say th...
Nobody has.  So far.
You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!
Well, somet...
I need you.
W...
Mirrors.
Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
She's too genuine.
Hate that.
My very point.  Here's another one...
Quite the little eccentric.
Waiter! Check, please!
She finds him "personable."
First girl I ever knew.  Who lets me give her a bath.
Firenze.
Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
That would be a girl.  I don't even know.
I never eat when I'm serene.
You never eat when you're despondent.
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
You keep saying that.
Well, you've got the rest of your lives.
No.  I've got you.
If you like.
You've been the man in mine.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
The night we met.
We danced to it.  Just like this.
Well.
Yes.
That's my point!!
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
It means a lot.
"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
It's over.
I just want to be alone.  Is that okay?
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento...
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
And your point?
Well.  How come she didn't...
She admits it's her fault.
Oh, yeah.
... yeah, that.
Shhh.
DON'T SPEAK!
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
Lower.
I came here, looking for her.
This is where I proposed.
It's two weeks.
Almost three.
That is so romantic.
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
The most important thing. Is being together.
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
... and you knew about this.
... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
You're much more his type.
Well, it better not happen again.
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
Grand Old Opera --
I hate that music.
I know that, Star.
Hi! Star.
Come on.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
No.
What's wrong honey.
Don't feel that way, honey.
Then why are you listening to her -
What?
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
You're so good.
How did you come in here?
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
You remember what I said about the Vitamins.
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
I got them right here.
Okay. Thanks.
She's fine.
Well, I just thought I'd call.
Well, you did and she's fine. Thanks.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
His Word.
Your job, huh.
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
Have you talked to Triplette?
Who the hell is he?
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
Who the hell is he?
He's going to run for president.
Third party?
What does he want?
Barbara Jean.
You know better than that.
It's on National television, Barnett.
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
Okay, then we'll see you there.
Hi. Come on in. Mary!
Don't you worry. We're just having a quiet Sunday at home.
Hal Phillip Walker.
President.
ABC.
How much?
Minimum.
D.C.
Okay.
Stop it!
When is it?
How come?
To the bathroom.
Yes. Percy Warner Park'.
What crook?
Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
I'll just be in here.
What is a turkey shoot.
Some guy was drunk and hit him. Accident. Haven almost killed him.
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Haven's not going to talk to me.
Sure he will.
Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
How'd you get in here.
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
Didn't you get?... How are you?
I'm fine. Can I go up?
Can I help you?
Yes, sir. I need a room
A little. What do you need?
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
He is just wonderful.
I'1l get your bag.
Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
That Tom sure is cute.
Replacement party.
Who's that?
Well, he's really amazing.
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
She had on high heels?
No.
Need a ride?
You in music?
No.
Get in.
Oh, well, thanks. Ah, oh, maybe you know where...
Do you carry door handles?
What kind?
Nash.
What year?
Sixty-three.
Oh... Well.
The car broke down.
Next you'll be sick.
I feel really good.
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
I don't think so.
How do you know if they do?
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
Bye.
Well, can you tell me why?
It just is.
How long have you been with them?
About three years.
No, I don't.
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
He's a member of our congregation.
Linnea?
Yes. Who's this?
I'm here.
Who is this?
I'm not sure. Where?
Oh, Tom, of course. What are you doing in Nashville?
Hi.
Who is this?  It's Tom.
I don't know who you are.
What?
Oh?
Doesn't it have a name?
Wrong.
I know.
I can't.
Car pool?
I'm not sure.
I knew when I first met you.
Older.
Well...
I'm twenty-eight
Oh.
That's what you said before.
Oh.
Yea.
I see.
I'm sorry but I have to go.
Linnea?
Yes.
It's me. What is it?
Eight-thirty in the chapel.
I'll be there.
How much?
Hello.
He's pretty well known down here.
Yes.
You're real favorites of his.
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
Might be good for you.
You're not.
Where's Bill?
Sleeping.
Where are you going?
Out.
I mean...
Mary?
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Probably a little too long.
Do you study at all?
Depends on what I'm studying.
Just a minute.
Hello.
I'm Opal.
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
What?
Where is she?
He is to a lot of people.
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
Southern California.
You always live there?
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
Who?
Peter Finch -- he's English.
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
I'll be dammed.
You bet.
Is that good?
It's not bad.
You think I should take lessons?
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
Sure thing.
May I see your costume?
More or less...
What was the color of Tim's belt?
The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
Which do you recommend?
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
When ya had it, did ya like it?
You got something you want to do?
Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.
Don't stop!
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
You been followin' the news coverage?
You've heard of it?
I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.
What?
You're taking us to that holding cell now.  All right, Cut!
Okay, Wayne, step forward.
She was born without a tongue.
Oh my God!  Sorry.
What?
Anything.
Tough titty, it's mine now.
Look, I'll trade you.
Yes, sir.
Not good.
Do you have a back up.
It's video.
Wagons, hooaaa!
Whose ratings were higher?
Yours.
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
What I'd like to do---
Manson beat you.
Not to anybody. She sings.
She sings? What does she sing?
Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.
Don't worry about it.
Was what worth it?
When have they ever been right?
Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
Where's it parked?
Out front.
Let me have the keys.
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
So, what now?
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
You made every day like kindergarten.
Unfortunately, yes.
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
And a snake-eye glare.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
They've hypnotized the nation.
Yes.
That's the way of the world.
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
They actually apologized.
Where do the air ducts lead?
Take a wild stab!
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
The entire wing?
That's my opinion.
Jesus...
Next week's episode.
Rockin'!
Scotty?
Wayne Gayle.
Wayne Gayle!
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
I assigned you Bingham and Washington to go along.
Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.
Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
Perfecto!
Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!
They're mesmerising.
Really?
Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
Two guys?
Okay. I'll take two guys off.
Fine.  Julie, why don't you make a food run?  What's around here?
Want me to come?
No thanks.
Come on, honey.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
It sure is.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
What d'you say, Duff?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
You in a big hurry, boy?
That's right.
Okay.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
You a union man?
Used to be. On the railroad.
What d'you think?
Don't start no trouble, boy!
I'll smile when it's funny.
Where was that?
Walker and Williams.
What did you say your name is?
She done moved to Detroit.
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
'That right? I thought he was up North.
People seen him 'round.
Where's he at?
I don't know.
Name's Duff.
How 'you doing?
Okay.
Don't say much, do you?
Guess I don't.
Have anything in mind?
No. What you usually say, I guess.
I don't know.
Well, he worked around.
And his age?
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
Any other family?
No. Just me.  Me an' her.
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.
Okay, thanks very much.
That's right. How' you doin', Barney?
That ain't my idea of friendliness.
Okay.
Yeah, I been there.
You must be new in town.
No. I'm new in town.
You working?
Yeah. On the section gang.
You work around town?
I'm a teacher.
Went to college, huh?
In Birmingham.
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
Your folks live there?
No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
What d'you expect?
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
You keep asking me why I'm here.
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
I like a place with lots of life.
No thanks.
Go on - you can have one!
What is it?
Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
I see. That beer made me dizzy.
Don't Duff--
Take it easy.
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
You almost got into trouble back there.
I wouldn't have let you.
Oh yeah, and then what?
What?
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
That's the way he is.
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
What d'you mean?
Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
Just for the day?
Goin' to see my kid.
I didn't know you had one.
Yeah. Well, I do.
Are you married?
No, I ain't married.  Well, good-bye.
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
That's right.
I'll see you later.
Four.
What's he like?
I thought you wasn't comin'.
What?
Your boy.
Okay, I guess.
I'll have some coffee, please.
How about it?
What happened, Duff?
Well, what d'you think?
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
That's all right with me. Always liked kids.
Yeah, that's so.
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
Duff - you know those women you used to know--
Am I as good as they?
Hmmm - good coffee.
You didn't answer my question.
Well, if you don't know I can't tell you.
Uh-huh. Why?
I don't want to hurt you.
Go on - hit me!
Don't look so scared.
You jivin' me?
We'll be all right.
How come you keep askin'?
I keep thinking about him.
Well, he ain't mine, so skip it.
Yeah.
Day work.
What're you going to do?
Watch out!
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
There's nothing to say.
Well, that'll be the first time.
When I get set, I'll send for you.
I don't think that'll happen.
Duff--
'Round town.
What's so hot 'round town?
Take it easy, Frankie.
How 'bout the key?
I bet she's easy jam.
Like what?
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
I wasn't thinkin' about you, Frankie.
'Got a good thing, man.
'Bye, Jocko.
Who're you?
I'm Duff.
Wouldn't have known you.
Wouldn't have known you.
What's on your mind?
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
Okay.
Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.
No.
'Don't sound so sure.
I heard you.
Better get him to a hospital.
Didn't I tell you to beat it - huh?
Okay.
Just tryin' to be helpful.
She'll do.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
I said, she's in great shape.
How often is that?
Yeah, sure. Good luck.
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
That's right.
How 'you gonna live?
Hell, I'm just like him.
I know he wasn't much of a father.
Good-bye, Duff.
How are you?
All right, son.
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
It's for your own good.
I'll be seeing you.
'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.
How you doin'?  Hi there!
What're you gonna get out of it, huh?
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Well, I got married to one of them.
Hell, I didn't know you was married.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?
I'll talk to the Mayor.
That'll make the folks very happy.
He's my son!
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
You're breaking my heart.  Got to see a man about a dog.
Okay, boy, beat it.
I ain't drunk, honey.
Like hell you ain't!
What's the matter now?
Right here.
Anything you say, baby.
I'm still on my honeymoon.
Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
No. I only needed the code from you.
Then we would have talked, you and I.
She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
Of course...
The Elders, mon...
Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
Why not?
Sense/Net's corporately financed. Too corrupt to be trusted. You of all people should know that.
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
Good, because you've got a new one.
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
What are you talking about?
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
Did you trace it?
No, but it traced me.
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
You see the couple up in the balcony?
We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
This ain't Bangkok, chief.
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
The words?
The access code to your mainframe.
Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
I don't have a girl.
No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?
It's Case. Remember me?
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
All things possible in Babylon.
I an' I, man. I an' I.
This place empty as a tomb, mon.
The girl 3Jane. We need her.
Can you walk?
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
Maybe so...
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
Never heard of him.
Nobody has.
How are we doing?
Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it.
We got problems topside.
How's the ice break?
Less than thirty minutes.
You'd better be, Bro. You better be.
How's the ice?
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
I'm getting too old for this shit. One oh four and counting.
I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
What?
No!... No...
I thought you already left.
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
I don't know. I don't know...
Why should I want to meet him.
Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
What about before that?
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
What's that supposed to mean?
What?
Almost two days.
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
Go ahead...
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
So you're a wire junkie.
...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
Put the gun down, Case.
Case...
I don't sleep much. You packed?
They'll cut you down.
Give me five minutes.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
For Peter, that's a short trip.
Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
No we don't...
Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
What is it?
Hold on.
What are you talking about?
Sure. No problem.
Yeah, I know.
Yes, it's lame.
I'm late for lab.
YOU KNIT?
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
Nope.
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
If you say so.
Roger in Op/Ed.
Who told!
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
That is lingerie.
Very romantic.
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.

Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
Just get in the van, Josie.
Hidden camera.
Wings?
Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
Transitioned?
You crossed over.
Do I want to be crunched?
By Guy?
Rosalind and Orlando.  From "As You Like It"?  Shakespeare?
So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
Eh.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
A--flack jacket.
But I don't want it straightened out.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Have you been to any parties?
They hid my car--
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
Dude, you rock!
Yeah, you gonna be there?
Hey. There.
I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
I'm Rob's prom date.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
See!
Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!
Do you remember high school?
It was a long time ago -
Don't you remember what they called you?
Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
I can't do this.
Little known fact.
That's the spirit!
And a gymnast!
Rufus?
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
Thanks. And what are -
Duh. Tom Cruise. "Risky Business".
Sorry. Forgetful.
You like her?
I love the way she writes.
College. Haven't really thought about it.
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
Thank you.
You remember that story?
Of course. I remember everything from your class.
Don't look down!
You have to say that. You're my student.
I don't have to say that.
I know.
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
When are you going to open your eyes?
I'm thinking when I'm home.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
To put us back together again when we fall.
Do you think you'll find her?
Yeah, actually I do.
Thanks. So do you.
Yeah, I have.
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
I just can't look at you the same way.
I finally found my story.
What?
I don't know.
Who are you guys?
You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
Duh.
Yeah. Definitely.
Maybe we should sit.
Lock.
<i>                      I'm not the dumb one...</i>
We went through the door...
Everybody knows about--
Barrel.
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
<i>                      Three of a kind...</i>
We can handle it.
And heavy...
Where?
For this.
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
No.
Why not?
He stayed a long time.
<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
<i>                      That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
<i>                      Now and forever...</i>
<i>                      Shut up and listen...!</i>
Maybe he doesn't know...
It's getting there.
Don't be a smart ass.
I told you I want that room unpacked.
Oh, come on Dad...
No.  Upstairs.
Don't tell me it's not the gas!
Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
I'm Jesse now, Lisa.
Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.
Where's Jesse?
I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
He's dead, you bitch.
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
You got a problem with me, Grady?
Naw. Just killing time.
What the hell are you talking about?
It was okay.
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
Schneider's always got a stick up his ass.
Only the wet ones.
What are you doing here?
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
It's happening again.
Ah, nothing.
Look at this car.  Are you kidding?
That's okay, I wanted to.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Let me look at your eye...
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
You mean a shithead.
Yeah.
Uh-uh.  Before my time.
You don't have to.  You just have to believe in energy.
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
Make a left at this corner.
It's a surprise.
What's this?
What do you mean?
C'mon, cut it out.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Shhh.  Just concentrate.
Uh-uh.  Wait...
About not finding any bogey men?
I'll get over it.
Whoa!
What is it?
I don't know - a sharp pain.
Oh, Jesse...
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
You want to talk about it?
I'm not hungry.
Will you leave me alone?  Please.
I killed him!  I killed him!
Who?  Who's doing this to you?
Hi.
Huh?
Okay, I guess.
Making friends?
Fine.
Hi, Kerry.
Yor dad picking the music again?
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
Okay...thanks.
We're going to bed.
Thanks, Mom.
Did she always have nightmares?
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
Can't it wait till morning?
Please Mom?  I just don't want to be alone.
How's your hand?
They're healing up nicely.
Watching TV.
Jennifer --
No, she's right.
Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
Last time, it was me against him.  I wasn't strong enough...alone.
No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
To old friends.
Yes.  I'm going to see her tonight.
I -- I think so!
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
Yeah, but I was really not good.
That was different.
He's heavy in the halls...
How do we find him, Kristen?
I don't know.
They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
I think so.
I'm so proud of you all.  Tell Neil I...
Can't be good news coming from you.
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
So?
Those are ancient history.
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
It'll be my last chance.  Pleese?
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
You know what he did.  He's doing it again.
Nancy...
What's that supposed to mean?
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.
Call me Nancy.
Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
Didn't get much sleep.
Well, we've got --
Never been here before?
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
That's right.
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
Doesn't matter.
For what?
The truth.
Try me.
Everybody take five.
There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.
I've heard crazier things this week.
There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
What about Kristen?
We can't get to her.  I've tried.
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
They used to keep a spare key.
What?
No.  We're alone.
A sad choice.
I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
Cooling down.
Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
This is stupid.
Yeah?  What did we ever do?
Where...here?
Me too.
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
Oh God.
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
Well... a shot at it.
I'm delighted.
Night, night, Honey.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
I'm not listening.
And then I... right.
Here, let me help.
No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
Coffee?
No.
Orange juice -- probably not.
Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
I forgot my bag.
Oh right.
Thanks.  Well...
Hi.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
Hello.
I brought these, but clearly...
Yes.
Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
Okay.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
That's fine.
Busy tomorrow?
I thought you were leaving.
What did you say?
Nothing.
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't.
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
She left me.
Uh-oh.  That's not good.
I don't know either.
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up?
Why?
I think goodbye is traditional.
Come in.
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
I have thought about you.
Oh no no -- no.
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
Cartwright.
My son's name is Johnny?
Yup.
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
What do you think?
You think I should do Henry James instead?
Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
Yes.  Always have had.
Big feet -- large shoes.
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
Okay.
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
Stay forever.
Damn, I forgot the jam.
Don't ask.
I don't know what happened.
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to...
But... wait... there are things to say.
Hello.
You disappeared.
Thank you.  Shall I...
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
Who is it?
Yes.
Can I have your autograph?
What's your name?
Rufus.
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
Miracles do happen.
Does the girl have a name?
He wouldn't say.
Christ, what is going on in there?
And this is William.
Yes.
The movie star?
Yup.
No!
Don't even ask.
Right. 
In a depressingly asexual way.
I never fancied you much actually...
Tony -- what do you think?
Yes, I think that one may be.
That's nice.
What?
Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
Where's Bella?
No -- it's my 22nd.
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
Da Vinci?
Di Caprio.
Yes.  What do you think?
Well, yes.  Groovy.
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
You daft prick!
It was good.
Still, not sparkling.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
Ahm... Bernie.
Mr. Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound.'
Yes?
Have you got a moment?
This is Henry James film?
Well, fire away.
Any bit in particular?
Yes, better get me a half.  All I can afford.
That's right -- Topol.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
So it could have been neither of them?
Can I help you?
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
No, it doesn't.
Do you ever masturbate?
Definitely no comment.
I think you do, yes.
I believe I have.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
No, don't think I do.
So not over her, in fact.
Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
May I help you, sir?
How about Miss Flintstone?
No, sir.
Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Does she know you're coming?
No, no.  She doesn't.
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
Well... wait for it...  First there's this one...
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Good luck.
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Hi...
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Two?  That's it?
Absolutely not.
What?
Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
Oh shit, is that the time?  I have to go.
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Sort of.
And she's in your house.
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
No -- you're right.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
Why not?
Just take my work for it.
Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Three.
Yes.
Oh.  Right.
Fabulous.
Yes.
What?
The one down your trousers.
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
But you have no proof.
No, Miss Ratched...
And yet you suspect her.
Yes, that is correct.
Why?
Would you like to start?
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
Tell us about it...
I was in luh-love with her.
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
Who? Tell me!
M-M-Muh-Muh-McMurphy!
No! No! No!
Will you come with me, please.
Hold the fort down, will ya, fellas!
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Yes, ma'am.  Lead the way, Sam.
Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
On this ward?
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
Oh, I had them removed.
What for?
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
Yes. Now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly.
Right!
Yeah?
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
A vote is before the group.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
No, it was irresponsible!
Thank you, ma'am.
I hope everything is settled.
Thank you, ma'am...
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
Thank you, ma'am.
Please see to Mister Bromden.
Yes, Miss Ratched...
Yes, Miss Ratched...
H-H-Hearts.
B-B-Billy.
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
Shhh...
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
Go ahead! Go back!
Yeah, kid?
C-C-C-C-Candy!
M-M-M-Mack?
Thank you.
God Bless America.
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Yeah...
Are they all crazies?
Wow! They're so quiet.
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
What for?
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.
Come here!
Let me get on your shoulders.
Sure, Mack...
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
Where ya goin', Mac?
Shhh...
They went that way.
Yeah!
Hey, what's that?
I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
Shhh...
Through the ass.
Me, too...
Me too...
My feet hurt...
What?
Your buddy is callin' ya.
I'm seeing what a busy man does.
Lobotomy!
Lobotomy?
That!
She's not all that homely, Mister McMurphy. In fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady.
You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
You heard me the first time!
Okay, Harding, you're on.
Just warmin' up.
So why are you talking to him?
What for?
That's nice. Send me a post card.
Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
I was open! Come on, let's play ball!
I said out!
No!
I'm the coach!
I just started!
I don't trust you!
Scanlon out!
Let me see your hand!
No!
No!
Why not?
I'm not running a charity ward...
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
Yesterday...
Who told you that?
Can you borrow me a dime?
Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta change...
What's this?
Whadaya bet, Cheswick?
A nickel.
Yeah, Mac?
Bye-bye.
I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
No. Me! Me!
Me, too! Me, too!
Me too! Me too!
Yeah, it's cold!
I'm hungry.
No.
What is it?
He's not!
He is!
McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
I see.
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
That's correct, Doc ...
No, this is my first trip, Doc.
Good. Good.
I'm afraid not.
I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
We'll let you know.
Time out!
Replacement coming in! Harding out!
Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back!
What's the horse pill for, honey?
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
Shhh!
No, 'fraid not...
I'm the next one.
How do ya know that?
Because I quit breathing.
You're breathin' right now.
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
What's going on?
Shhhh. Time to say goodbye.
Yeah!
How much ya wanna bet?
Ten bucks.
Sure...
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
Okay. Who else?
Yeah, what's up?
Shhhh. See ya around the ball park.
Our prayers have been answered, Turkle! Our prayers have been answered!
Come an' see.
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
What are they?
To help you relax... please...
You an' me, Chief.
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
You comin' in to hold my hand?
Yeah...
He's in charge.
Are you a doctor?
Hi.
Big man!
On what?
Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy.
Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!
This way, Mister McMurphy.
After you, ma'am.
Thank you.
Thank you, ma'am,
Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
Asshole.
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
How 'bout twenty?
Now you talkin'.
Bet!
You're a witness, Doc!
Jus' playin' the game, sucker...
Take you han's offa me!
Evenin', ma'am.
Is everything all right?
Why, sure, ma'am...
At this hour?
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
What's that?
What?
That!
Is he in an asylum?
He's dead.
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
No, she wasn't my sister.
Your mother.
Of course not.
Your grandmother?
I-- I must've misplaced it.
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
Because.
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
What's she doing?
No.
Yes.
Your hair... is perfect.
Let's find a telephone.
We found each other, didn't we?
Yes.  We did.
It's alright...  this is our destiny.
What great aunt?
No.
No...
Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
Ask her if she knows where he is?
What's mezzaluna?
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
Wait.  I have to write this down.
Okaaaaayyyy.
Please, Larry.  I have to hurry.
What?...
Hi there...
Thanks.
I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
I'm at the airport.  Why?
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
You said whatever it was you would understand.
That was before I found out what it was.
I'm in love with you.
Are you okay?  You want some help?
You are leaving, aren't you?
If it's any of your business, yes.
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
To the foot doctor.
You didn't answer my question.
Why are you asking me this?
So it wasn't real.
Because.  I know where he is.
I'd really rather not say.
Please.  I need to know.
Mickey Spillane.
Mickey Spillane?
Or Hustler.
Hi.
Yeah.
Well, good.  Good for you.
What?
Nice dress.
What are you doing here?
We were hungry.
Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that?
The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--
The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
Yeah.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
No.  Are you're leaving?
No.  I just came by to apologize.
In that case... no...
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
Okay.  I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.
GET OUT!!
What?
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
I can't believe you did that!
What would you call it?
I would call it-- unforgivable.
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
I brought you that, too.
Uh huh.
Beautiful place...
Sure is.
Just since yesterday.
Any night.
Well, not exactly...
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
Yes?
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
Really...
And more...
Don't worry about it.  You're my guest.
You like shrimp?  I like shrimp.
Oh, hello.
Mommy, this is Faith.
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
How about the other one?  His friend.
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
How about that guy at the bank?
Oh.
So, what's your point?
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
Is he married?
No.
Is he gay?
I don't know, Kate.
You don't have any idea?
He's a podiatrist or something.
Why don't you ask him?
Larry brought me flowers last night.
Is that bad?...
I think he's having an affair.
No...  I can just tell.
It's still the new year...
What about your job?
I have vacation time coming to me.
Maybe.
What?
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
He fell out.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?
What'd you find?
A Butterfinger wrapper.
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
What is it?
A phone message.  Only--
Only what?
Only, it's in Italian...
'Course he does.
Polo.
Right.  My brother.
You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
Because I'm the one who's single.
I never even got to be single.
Sure you did.
Nope.
Good luck.
I meant about my idea.
I think it's time we got some professional help.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Hi.  Where've you been?
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Packing.
Why?
A little bad luck?
It was a ouija board, remember?
...and a fortune teller.
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
What?
You sure you'll be okay?
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
Is Damon Bradley here?
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
And he is living proof.
Yes.  He is.
Uh huh.
What about Larry?
Kate.
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
A porco?
Oh.
I thank you.
Huh?
That's exactly what you are.
Well, there's nothing here to eat.
You used to love it when I called you doll.
What?  You know him?
He missed me.
She didn't give me a chance.
She's not here.
Where is she?
Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
Sorry...
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
Well, where are they?
I'm not thirsty.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
But my own kid bro
It's a living.
Nolan? I knew he had guts but
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
What the hell!!!
The point is there isn't much time, kid.
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
"In the church when you need me." Was there ever a saint who hid in the Church?
Hello, Edie.
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
Terry... Terry... .
What makes him so special?
None of your business.
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
They play pretty rough.
Which side are you with?
I'm with Terry.
I'll get home all right now.
I better see you get there.
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
I want to be a teacher.
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
I can get home all right from here
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
How would you've done it?
Do you like pigeons?
I don't know.
I really don't know.
He had a few birds.  I got up and fed 'em this morning.
How do you like that one?
I don't know.
How do you like it?
It's quite  nice.
How about another one?
No thanks... .
Hit me again, Mac.
Naw, in the ring, a dive is-
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts!  You really believe that drool?
Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
What for?
For not being any help?
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
That goes double for me.
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
It was Johnny Friendly who killed Joey, wasn't it?
Go ahead, wear it.
Terry, what's wrong?
I've been sittin' in the church.
The Father. The Father.
I just told the Father.
What I did to Joey.
What I did to Joey.
Don't tell me don't tell me!
Edie it's
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
Get away from me.
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
Get out of my way.
No, I can't let you. I can't, you're
Thanks just the same.
Well, it's over.
Are you sure they're your friends?
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
Pop!
Let me by.
I'll find you a priest.
About Edie?
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
Now don't give me a hard time.
What do you want from me, Father.
This is my business.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
Give me that gun.
What did you say?
You go to
I can? Okay.  Okay...
But you still hold out for silence?
Are you on the level, Father?
What do you think?
What about it?
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
Take it easy.
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
You want to know something I would have taken Wilson
Listen, this ain't for publication.
I'm just resting my feet.
I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
Raise a hand to me and... .
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
You'd be off the pier for good.
O.K., O.K., That's enough.
My ain't we touchy this morning?
Doyle.  Joey Doyle's... .?  ... .You're his... .
My lead bird. He's always on that top perch.
No.
No?
Take it easy now, Terry.
Keep the advice. Give me the whiskey.
Hit me again.
Easy. Easy, boy.
Hey look-
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
I'll see you on the roof.
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
Forty-five bills.
Hey, Terry, front and center.
So-so, Johnny.
Don't hit me, now, don't hit me!
It's good for you. Develops your mind.
Thirty-six sev aah I lost the count.
He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
I got it. Hot off the press.
You want to know somethin'?
What do you mean?
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
Thanks for nothing, you bum.
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
You don't think he'd be helpful?
Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
One of these days.
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
I do not joke in my proposal.
No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
Who's to say my monsters aren't alive?
In there.
It frightens me.
Then..then what's that music?
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
I'm not sure...
What do you mean?
Be careful!--They'll see you.
Don't let them hear you.
What can we do?
Whatever you do, don't do that.
Be careful!
I am--It's our only chance.
Nothing is worth your life.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
You're talking nonsense.
There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
Of course I do.
A situation easily remedied.
Tie them that they may watch.
A symbol, Master.
What kind of symbol?
El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
It would seem so, Master.
Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
Ahh, she will be yours.
When!?
The moon is almost gone!
Ahh, there is yet time.
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
Well then let us proceed.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
Oh, if there is only time!
For what!?!
Your pleasures of course!
You mean...!
You may take her now.
Is there time?
You better hope there is.
Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
You know better than that.
We don't know of anything, Master...
Then why do you shake so?
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
What do you suppose for?
Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
Without the snake, of course.
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
I said not as a rule.
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
What're you talking about?
Yes, it is.
Uh-- sorry.  Wrong number.
Who is it?
From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
He didn't want me to.
Why not?
He'd call every once in a while.
He called the day he escaped.
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Who are you?
Yes.
You did work for Emil, right?
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
You were his what, his box?
His assistant.
Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more.
Why you want to do that, to a frien'?
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Just that she got away.
You better come see this.
You at least bring the gun?
Sure looks that way.
Let's go to Detroit.
Now you're talkin'.
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
How long you talk to her?
Two hours.
Forty-five minutes.
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
Yes, she did.
Yeah, I did.
I get that feeling, yeah.
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
And who watches your back?
I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
I don't ski.
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
Yeah, hi.  Nice house.
They sure do.
Shit.
What?
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
And then they'll kill 'em.
At least.
All you gotta do is get in.
I'll go with you.
Daniel Burdon, FBI.
What'd you talk about?
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
It was an unusual experience.
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
You have to know what you're talking about.
Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
They're in 7D.
You're gonna use a ram?
Yeah, why?
The manager's door is metal.
Wait.  You not Adele?
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
What do you want to bet?
I could walk out of here.
Excuse me, Adele?
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
Why you think is today?
How are you, Raymond?
Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer.
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
No, I didn't know that.
Wait, I know him --okay?
Yeah.
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
I bet.  How much?
Another C.
The fuck you talking about?
Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is...
You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
I've seen 'em used on TV.
Someone down here?
Nervous?
A little.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.
In my bag, in the car.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
Why, are you famous?
I thought so, too.
Of course I am.
You don't act like it.
You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
We still talk, though.
Sure.
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
I mean, romantically.
Uh-huh.  Well, but if --
Yes.
Who was it answered the phone?
None of your business.
Really.  He has a cop's face.
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
Think I could have them back?
Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
Why not?
Because you're having too much fun.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
I just thought maybe you and me could--
Don't leave me.
Those guys bother you?
Love it.
What, as a sales rep?
A girl.
I like your hair.  And that suit.
It smelled.
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
How far do we go with this?
It's not a game.  Something you play.
Well, does it make sense to you?
I called your room from downstairs.
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
So do you.
That's not what you were about to say.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
Yeah, but in a nice way.
Why not?
Outside Adele's.
To warn her about Chino.
So she did help you?
I don't think we should get into that.
I'm just going to the bathroom.
Pretend I'm somebody else.
You think I'd shoot you?
I told you, I'm not going back.
You just did, for Christ sake.
You know what I mean.
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc.  What's going on?
I see better with them on.
You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
The backseat.
These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
When?
Looks like tonight.
You know who they are?
Must be a real soft pillow.
Any time.
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
It works.  You should try it sometime.
The next time I walk into a bank.
What's to think about?
Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..."
How are you, Richard?
Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.
We'll go to my bank.  I'll make a withdrawal.
I'm not leaving Midge.
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
For a time.
Meaning?
Meaning time came, I left.
You busted out?
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
There were others.
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
The <u>ninth</u>?
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
Glenn, take the exit.
Jesus, I don't believe it.
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
Gee, I wonder why not.
I'm freezing my ass off.
It's a guy you know.
Gimme another hint.
If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open.
Right now, son.
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
Great.  We got one of 'em.
How you know that?
I can tell.
I <i>was</i>...
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
What do you want?
I'm looking for Maurice.
Thanks.
You a lawyer?
He said he stayed here last November.
Here?  In this house?
He said he stayed with Maurice.
Got run over by a car.
What did you call it?
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
Something better.  Open it.
It's a --
Technically.  They're separated.
Oh, he's moved out?
He's about to.
Then they're not separated, are they?
Can we change the subject?
What're you doing at Glades?
You used to like it.
Dad...
We don't get to talk much any more.
What'd I say?
"Hey, yourself."
Huh.
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
No, he looks a lot...
Off a tip?
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
Not at all.
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
I didn't have time.
I imagine you would've though.
It's possible.  Why?
Out for the evening?
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
When's he due back?
Like a fag.
Yeah, as soon as we got back.
Still...
Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
Where you been hiding, Dick?
Where the fuck is Foley?
Jack Foley, famous bank robber.
Are they dead?
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny, you coming?
No, I was.
You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.
Only when I'm n-n-n-
Yes Sir.
Too late for apologies, Walker.
Where's that lizard?
What lizard?
What the hell happened to you guys?
No, like...
You guys are new?
Yeah, but he was wearing shoes!
They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...
You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.
Power dive!
Kill the bastards!
Land of the free...
Home of the brave!
There's another one!
The Colonel helped me work it out.
Some other time.  I don't feel like a party.
If you can't keep up, don't drink yours.
What facts are those?
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
How's this for a fact?  I loved her first.
Come on!
Six P-40's.
They're coming around for another pass. You got extra weapons and ammo?
Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
I got a half a tank.  You?
I'm out of fuel!
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
We've always tried to beat each other.
Longer?  It's getting shorter.
Home of the Brave.
I can't make it.
Yes you can.
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
Hang on.
I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
Y-Yes Sir.
We can explain, Colonel.
Explain what?
Boxin'.
Win?
Yes'm.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
What do you get for winning?
You too, Lieutenant.
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
We must go ahead.  This is our moment.
Learn English, then!
Fook ya dooble!
Peggy Sue!
I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight.  How would you like that?
It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
Goodbye, Grandma.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her.
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
Peggy Sue!
You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
Who knows. Remember...  Whatever Walter wants...
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
I can't. It's all too much.
Go on. You can do it.
Were taking you back to the nurse.
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
On what?
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
That loudmouthed little bitch~
It's that jerk Walter.
What happened?
Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
Why do guys do such stupid things?
Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
Don't say that...
I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
And nothing will ever change that.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
I'll think of a way to sell, them.  One day.
Pretty strange.
I call this the staccato. 
Would I?!! Why I oughta...
Thanks.
Yeah. Like that.
Good.
Great, isn't it?
Is this slow enough for you?
Charlie, how are you?
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
Come on, let's dance.
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
Save it.
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
Charlie. About last nights..
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
I have to talk to you..
Let's go down to the basement.
I just can't trust you anymore.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
How'd you know about that?
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
Right here. Now sit down.
It opens, too. Look inside.
I know.
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
I've got to go now.
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
I'm trying.
I thought you were...for a while.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
I'll just set it right here.
Then hold me.
Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you.
Touchy, touchy!
Take a long walk on a short pier.
Have a nice day.
Terry! Slow down.
What, why?
First a nerd and then a weirdo. What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll tell Charlie.
It must run in the family.
Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
Coffee and a donut.
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
I hate chickens.
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
What a treat.
Can we split now?
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Thank God for that.
All right. But this better be good.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
Doing some shopping?
Open it.
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
This morning was good.
The hat business is in trouble.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
He'll win.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
You have four seasons, you have four slumps.
We'll make it, we'll be fine.
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
How do you feel?
I'm home now.
Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
What about?
The house payments.
Sure, Mom.  Hello.
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
I had a dream that Grandma died.
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
For what?
Maddy's party.
I don't feel very festive.
Way to go, Mom!
Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
I'm just happy to see you.
Why not? They're my favorite.
Rosalie Testa!
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
You're a sweet man, Richard.
It really wasn't that difficult.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
What's that?
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
You're giving me the creeps.
Am I dead or not?
There's one way to find out.
What if you're not here tomorrow?
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
When do we start?
Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
Oh.	And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous.
What are you doing?
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
What do you know about hypnosis?
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
One... two... three.  You are now awake.
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.
I suppose so.
There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
Yes... why?
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
It's been a few years.
You alright?
I'm going out, Dad!
I'm not hungry.
All set.
Anywhere but here.
Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are.
He pissed me off.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
I'm not burying him here...
Why not?
There's a better place...
The old Indian burial ground.
Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
He was dead. You know he was.
You think he'd believe it if he did?
What do you mean?
I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
All the time.
Right here, Mom...
You know everything, don't you?
Charles is right behind me.
You'll never find it in the dark.
Bob...
What's wrong with your face?
Sorry...
K-R-O-one.
Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
What's that on your forehead, pal?
Really? Who thinks that, sir?
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
I said, don't worry about it.
A reaction to AZT...
You're not smiling.
Drew!
I promise!
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
That shit's saving your life, you asshole!
Close the law book.
I'm not going to close the--
CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!
That's not what I said.
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
What's that mean?!
Maybe you should think about it.
I'm not going to die.
Whatever.
No sweat, buddy.
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
I'm seeing him this afternoon.
About my blood work?
We're waiting...
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
Funny.
I have AIDS.
It's okay. Can I sit down?
Uh, yeah.
One week old.
Congratulations.
Little baby girl.
Kids are great.
Continue.
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
Continue.
My lover and I.
Your... lover?
As in, the vegetable?
Fine.
What?
Find a lawyer?
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
Rayisha.
Rayisha. Very nice.
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
Arline?
We're friends of Beckett's.
It's me, you dork.
I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
Not bad.
Get it?
Let's find you a drink.
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
Correct.
You're right.
Beckett?
Charles. Okay. Miller?
What?
Do you... pray?
What happens?
We proceed, representing your estate.
You're ready, don't worry.
What impressed you about him?
I suppose you could say that.
Except... you were gay?
I still am.
Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
I'm an excellent lawyer.
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
Thank you.
A good start.
You bet. We'll see you later.
Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
Yes.
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
No.
One. Here, in front of my ear.
Hi, Mom. It's me.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Were you recently promoted?
Is that a question?
I'm not worried. What are you doing?
Why are we going to do that?
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
Get real.
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
Were you pleased with his work?
We were satisfied.
It satisfied me.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
People who want to bend the rules...
Second.
Great.
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
Get a life.
How many do you know?
Lots.
Who?
Since when?
Probably since she was born.
Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.
Why should I?
A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
Any women on board?
Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
How did you do that?
Yes, we did.
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
On behalf of the defendants?
Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection.
You had one guy "like that?"
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
Dr. J.!
Andy, you don't want this.
You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?
Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
No matter how hard I try, I can't lose a file in my computer.
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
... It's time to get this society back on track!
Lookit. Lookit!
<u>What</u>?
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
What whispers?
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
They're coming.
Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
Actually...  That's what I been askin' myself.
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
Get out of our way.
One or two.
Audrey?
You sure you can keep --
As fast as you can.
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
I can't....I can't....
Here. Make it easy on you.
Just give me your hand.
But they...they could still be....
I would try for them.
It's starting....
Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
I know what's in here!
It hurts them. Light actually hurts them....
How many bottles?
Not sure. Ten?
What, switch what?
Hey, who?
Hey, me. Over here.
Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
Which means he went toward sunrise.
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
What?
Like what?
Like my pistola.
So why isn't it all bloody?
I assume he licked it clean.
So what happened? Where are they, then?
Wha'?
<u>Get the fucking cells over here</u>, Johns. What's the discussion?
He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
Never said you were a hype, either.
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
For your own fear.
What the hell's it matter?
How much?
79 kilos.
Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right?
You mean that "load" of passengers?
Some prophet guy?
For now.
Riddick?
And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
What?
Do what I say. Please.
And what about the cells?
Rain.
Which half?
You mean....
Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.
Give my blessing to the girl. She needs a spare.
KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
It's more a place where souls are found, Mr. Riddick.
All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
I'm born-again.
The child heard you before any of us could even....
Please...this solves nothing...please....
Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
Like an emergency life-raft, right?
Not staying in here another....
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
Well, you got the big gauge.
Wanna rag your fat mouth?
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
How 'bout a cut in your gut?
Said "looks clear."
Well, what's it look like now?
Looks clear.
Just realized that, huh?
What if you're one of five?
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
Don' look, don' look, don' look....
What do you care?
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?
So much for my cocktail hour.
What, it's broken?
Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
Do you have any weapons?
The best. But we won't need them.
Just the same, I want one.
It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?
Reconstructing a life. Care to have a look?
Neither do I.
Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
Remembers what?
The blood transfusion.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
Where did you learn to do this?
Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
And they fell out of the sky with you?
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
It's probably wrong --
You didn't think so then.
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
Geiger counter?
Yo!
No.
That way.
Any particular reason?
None at all.
Sustained.
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
He's trying to form words.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
Do as I say.
What signal?
To Earth! That we've landed!
Forget it. Abandon ship.
We're here to stay.
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
By our time.  You've turned gray.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better.
Let's take a look.
Okay.
Try telling them our names.
Zira doesn't want your female.
I want her.
Fine. Just let her out.
I'm for that.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
Relax. You'll see it all later.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
All right...  Get in...hurry.  Put this on.
The Hunt Club.
A man, Dr. Maximus.
We're -- conducting a new experiment.
My name is Taylor.
Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
Mind your tongue, madame.
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
Identify him, then. Speak to him.
You lied. Where is your tribe?
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Okay.Up to the cave.
Cease fire! Withdraw!
No, thanks. I'll take freedom.
Listen, listen -- I can speak --
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking.
Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
What is this?
A hearing.
Which one?
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
You want her that much?
She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
It's humiliating.
We can't.
All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
But perhaps he understood --
Like you, I find it difficult.
Where are they now?
What?
Where?
He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!
How the hell did he get away?
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
YOU AIN'T A FIRING SQUAD, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!
Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. BAAD SHIT.
Says he can't walk.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.
What?
You lame or something?
Barnes comes from Hell.
'Lias come naturally.
I got one...
Over here!
Okay, here it is - one, we got gooks in the fuckin' perimeter.
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
Out there man - behind the log.
No!
Yeah. How 'bout you?
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
Dawn...
...beautiful night.
And you, do you believe?
No... I move faster alone. 
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
What you got there - beers?
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
Later...
You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.
Sounds like it.
What are you talking about! 
You know what I'm talking about!
Merle? Jesus!... Patty?
Found it. Growing in a garden.
Sheeit, beats burning hutches anyway...
Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
That's what he is... Baaaa!
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
You don't want to hear about it?
My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
How far does this train go?
Vancouver, B.C.
I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.
Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
Indefinitely?
I don't know.
You don't know.
Very nice Mitchell turns.
No thanks?
Thank you.
What's the matter?
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
I'm sure you have.
Would you mind?
Okay. You win.
Why certainly, baby.
Just drunk enough.
Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
What did you say his name was?
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
Whatever you say.
I didn't say anything.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
I don't.
How did you meet him?
He was a great boy for that. What else?
I'd rather wait until it does matter.
There wasn't any plane.
It's always a mistake to run away. Always.
No thanks.
Bad enough.
He could hardly help suspecting you.
That's putting it mildly.
Quarter after one. Why?
Just who are you, anyway?
Dance? Here?
Why not?
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
Then he's-- 
We'll find out.
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
All right--following me.
Why?
Anything I can do about it?
No use waiting, then.
From you, I like it.
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
I don't think that's on the market anymore.  I'd like something much closer to the water.
They're going to arrest me.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
I have my own warrant.  Stop a minute, please.
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
There would be a moon tonight.
That, and the fun of it.
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
You-killed-him?
Do you think I was faking?
If I did-I don't-now.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Beer?  Well, all right.
Beer or ale, Miss?
Ale. I don't mind.
Right, Miss.
I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
I'm sorry.
Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him?
Yes.
Where's you get it?
A graduation present.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
I probably shall--after I've tortured you a little more.
You must come from pretty far South.
I've never been to Florida.
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
You've had dealings with the police before?
Who hasn't--one way or another?
I'd like to believe that. It's not too easy.
We try to be decent.
If I understand what you meant by that.
There isn't anything you can do.
I don't want to talk.
I've come here to arrest you for murder.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
Because you think your in love with me?
To do what?
I can't answer that.
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.
Morning. Any calls?
I'm not interested in blind dates.
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
For five hundred, what do I get?
I go home and paint the kitchen.
Got it on you?
Got the information on you?
Get it in half an hour.
In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
Martini.
You, Killaine?
And without much discrimination.
Leave that one lay.
They still hang women in Canada, I've heard.
So you're not a cop.
I've got good ears.
A private joke.
Round of golf Saturday?
If I can get off.
She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
That's what I thought, at first.  Maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party.  With my liquor of course.
Yes, I've seen it before.
Well--good night.
Thanks.  I don't mind.
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
I have a warrant for her arrest.
You'd be breaking the law.
Doesn't answer the question.
The only answer I have for you.
It could have been an accident.
That COULD BE TOLD.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
Where would she go, anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
Wait a minute.  I'll go with you.
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
Where did it all come from?  Or is that a permissible question?
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
Mr. Mitchell.
A little something on account perhaps?
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
I'm afraid this is all for the moment.
Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
What do you want?
And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
You told me when we'd identified this fellow--
Would you?
How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
The joint's not open, Mac.  Who's Brandon?
Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
You get it's brother.
So it seems Sergeant.
Right.
I've met her.
Unless the gun was slanted up.
I guess I'm just ballast around here.
Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.
I think so.
Where's the shell?
Should be over there.
You can find out.
Well.  What about it?
Oh nothing.
Are you always this witty?
Warm water, no doubt.
Positive?
Not quiet yet.
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
I don't understand.
How about Magruder?
He checks too.
That leaves two strangers.
So far.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
She might.
Brandon handled the money envelope.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Aye.  You have a point there.
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine.  Where's the girl now?
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
But you still think she's innocent.
I do.
What are my orders, sir?
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
Who's the girl?
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
You ought to know why.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
Correct. I couldn't even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me.
You don't have to make a pose of it.
What does it look like?
How long have you had it?
Years, why?
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
How about your new friend?
I told you she's just..
In an hour, Larry.
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
It's kind of you to see me.
And I'd like you to call me Ann.
I think you'll do very well.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
Yes.
Sit on that log, dear.
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
Keep me company.
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
I see.
Of course.
It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news.  He needs a poet's advice.
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
I'll have some of that.
...break away completely from--
And some of that.  Sorry.
No.  I'd want to--
Good.
Yes, please.
That's her.
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
I think it went on rather too long.
I couldn't bear for it to end.
And I didn't like that man.
Oh, but he was terrific.
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
Who?
I called you a taxi.
Very thoughtful.
Well, you know...
Me too.
I bet.  Thanks for the drink.
Did she talk about me?
No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
Well, you should.
Might?
In your car
Why not.
Oh ... excuse me.  There's Nicholas.
To the airlift.
To the airlift.
Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
Not yet you know any of these people?
No jokes.  James is in love.
To the Fleet.
And the Argies.
The Argies.
Come on.  Hand over.
You approve!
Let me see.
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
I'm not sure.
Hello.
I'm waiting for your mother.
Okay, I will.
Have you come to talk about me?
Not at all.  History.
Suez.  1956.
They don't count.
I'm not here.
Dad.
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.
Or a beer.  I've got some in.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
I'll ring you in the next couple of days.
Well, it's worth seeing.
What would you call it?
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
U-huh.
Darling Susan.
You're so famous now.
Voila!
You'd look naked without one.
Promise.
'Night.
Tom . .. bed!  Go on.
Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
And that's why you never went pro?
De nada.
Come with Tyler.  She knows.
No, Bells Beach, Australia.
Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
Once.
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
You gotta earn trust.
Then we'll earn it together.  Here, take mine.
My man!
Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
I'll take that as a yes.
After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
You do it... you first!
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
Okay!
But you're not alone.
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
Naw, you pull it!
SHIT!!
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
You never were...
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
Sir?
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
Fine.
Surf conditions okay?
A little mushy.
What?
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Welcome to Sea World, kid.
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
The fucking punks are surfers.
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
It's all balance, right?  And coordination.  How hard can it be?
Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.
Nice tattoo, Dietz.
No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
They took a left at the next light!
Nothing.
Figured you did.
Kid, get outta the way!!
NOOO!!
Shrimp and fries.
Catch of the day.
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
Warm them up.
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
You're kneeling on my hand.
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
My name's Johnny Utah!
Who cares!
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
Something... in the trees...
You never did know when to quit.
The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
No more games.
We're going to need everyone.
Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
Anytime.
We both got scores to settle.
I saw it.
It's been a long time, General.
There's something else, Major...
Mmmnnn...?
I can't tell.
I think it's Hawkins.
Where the hell is his body?
There's no sign of it.
He's not really my uncle.
They never are, dear.
I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
Thunder's a horse.  Come on.
Hope to be?
Storage, I think.
Not with those smokestacks it's not.
What?
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
You looking' for some company?
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
That's ridiculous.
Sit-and-spin.  Alright... why not?
No.
Stolen?
Not exactly.
If you can figure it out, be my guest.
You're not from L.A., huh?
New York.
What motel you staying at?
<u>Ho</u>tel.
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.
So do day jobs.
Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean to.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
For the whole night?
For an hour.
You're joking.
I never joke about money.
Fine.
What's your name, lover.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Edward... you got it!
What?
Exactly.
Diet coke.
Can I have some chips?
-- and a bowl of strawberries. Thank you.
Always.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
And why do you say that?
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred.
They should be.  They're both good at it.
Oooh, thank god.
Why?
Just a romantic, that's you.
Yes...
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
I'd say you give a good dollar value.
"Occupational hazard".
No shit.  They expensive?
What?  Why?
What are assets?
Of course.  How much?
Five full nights... days too?
All right, two thousand.
Three.
Done.
Holy shit.
Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
Did you buy some clothes?
I got a dress, yeah.
Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
Any good?
I think you'll approve.
Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
You liked the guy, though.
Uh-uh.  No work.
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
Good.
Come with me?
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
No.
He died a long time ago.
I think it's exciting.
What id we run into someone I know?
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
He's good at what he does.
Vivian, what the --
Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.
Shush.  Of course you can.
What if I lose it?
You won't.
I'll guard them and you with my life.
The opera.
Did you?
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
You just did.
It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
It was good.
Vivian...
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
Afternoon.
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
No.
Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!
I'm here.
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
Do it.
Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Vivian's in sales.
I'm up.
I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
Edward, we've been together ten years.
Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
Forget it.  We work for it.  We keep it.
Kit!  Where've you been?
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
Yeah.
Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
Who did you think?
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
Yeah.  I just got it.
Yeah... I know what you mean.
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
Dummy.
Wow, are you in deep shit.  You know he'll break your heart.
Do I!?  Momma!
And leave all this?  Not in a million.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
Rent.  You're late.
You bullshittin' me?
Of rent I do not bullshit.
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
Oooh, I love those.
I leave extras, miss.
You're a guest here?
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
I... Edward...
Vivian.
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
I think you'll find it normal enough.
Will I like it?
You'll like it fine.
Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
They will serve salad.
But what if they serve soup?
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
I like steak.
Then you would use your--
Miss Vivian.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
Yeah, well, I check out today.
You're not accompanying him to New York?
I'm just looking, thanks.
Yes.  Something... conservative.
Yes...
I don't think it would fit you.
Excuse me?
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Do you remember me?
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
I was in here yesterday.
Yeah.  Thanks.
Till they kill you. Yeah.
Then why bother curing me?
Of course.
Should I be?
Brides often are, I'm told.
I do not marry tonight.
Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
He knows I do not love him.
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.
With pride. What can I do for you?
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
Nothing you can say will upset me.
As you wish.
Of course you will.
But what if something happens to you?
Hear this now: I will come for you.
But how can you be sure?
This is true love. You think this happens every day?
There will never be a need.
You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
No. No. We have already succeeded.
Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist...
Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
What?
It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
I believe you -- So what happens now?
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
And a good thing too.
Anybody want a peanut?
Veer left. Left. Left!
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
If there are, we'll all be dead.
It's you.
True!
Yeah?
I don't think more than ten.
But you don't know where he is.
Everybody ... MOVE!!
Have you any money?
I have a little.
Over the Albino, I think.
Where did you get that?
What?
I hope we win...
I'll be right back.
What is it?
Open it up.
-- well, when does it get good?
I don't be-leeve this.
What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
Someday, you may not mind so much.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
Do you want me to go on with this?
I don't understand.
Sire.
Try ruling the world sometime.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
DEATH FIRST!!
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
Let me explain --  -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.
And our assets?
Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.
Not yet.
Light him.
I thought he was with you.
-- offer me money --
-- power too -- promise me that --
-- offer me everything I ask for --
-- anything you want --
Hah?
Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
Thank you.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
Nothing comes to mind.
Again. Thank you.
You are ready, then?
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
Then why are you smiling?
And what is that?
I am not left-handed.
I am not left-handed either.
No one of consequence.
I must know.
Get used to disappointment.
Okay.
That would be inconceivable.
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
You know what a hurry we're in.
There will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!
I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
Morons.
Good. Then pour the wine.
I smell nothing.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
I will. And I choose --
Don't say another word, Valerie.
Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
I'm not listening.
Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
A good hour. Yeah.
Think it'll work?
It would take a miracle. Bye!
A little bit.
Guess what.
Your grandfather's here.
You are sick, that's why he's here.
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
Maybe he won't.
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
What are you saying?
"Of the silvery moon,
"Of the silvery mooooon,
"I want to croon,

How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
Oooooooops!
Ooooooops.
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
Good, what is it?
Well, sir, it seems ...
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, you're using up your time.
It's nothing ... nothing.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
What you were saying.  Keep talking.
What was I saying?
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
That's very kind of you, Mr. Bialystock, but I ...
Oh.
Then stick with Bialystock!
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
Do you think he'll take the job?
Only if we ask him.
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
To failure!
No way out.  No way out.
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
Double.  Double.  Double.
Shut up.
What is it?
"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
Vat about it?
Good.  I will make the preparations.
All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you.
Come on.  Let's get going.
Qviet.  Qviet  This is very important.
Nice girl.
Call chauffeur.  Get car.
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
No.  We go. 
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
Get car.  Get car.
You can count on me-o, you dirty young man.
Here I come, ready or not.
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.

Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one and all in the light.
What have you done, LSD?
No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
We can't... we keep our money there!
Send for Goebbels.
I told them we invaded England.
Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
Groovy!
Oh.
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
Of which morning?
The following morning. Sunday.
No one met her?
Or arrived with her.
What do you mean?
What?
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
Not at all!
Someone is sitting in that window.
If she paid you well?
Now, look...!
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.
No. I told you, she's confined...
Who are you, friend?
Must've needed it.
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
Sam, if she's here...
In the building ...  Mary starts for the building, glancing once in the direction of the Patrolman.
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
Okay. If you'll come along...
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
A lot?
Forty thousand dollars.
And the police haven't been able to...
With the forty thousand dollars?
Your Detective told you a nakedfaced lie.
Just what he told your detective.
May I talk to you?
Sure...
Lila.
Is Mary here?
With you.
Where?
Don't you know?
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
What do you know about it?
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
Huh?
I hate tears. 
Is Mary... in trouble?
Yes.
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary.
You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.
She'll need both of us.
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
It's been three.
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
Where's the old highway?
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
An hour! Or less!
And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?  Thanks.
Sam, I'm going.
You'll never find it.
Contemplate your... panic button.
Sam.
In a hurry.
Who's he?
He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.
Does that mean we can't...
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
Of course we will.
Alive.
Huh?
Hospital clean.
What?
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
Why not?
Bates.
I could stand something regular.
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
The only girlish thing you have lost.
Sam. This is the last time.
For what?
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
Can you?
I can come down next week.
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
Sam, let's go get married.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
Norman Bates.
You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
You'd know, of course.
I imagine so.
I'm looking for a private island.
What are you running away from?
Why do you ask that?
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
Why don't you go away?
To a private island, like you?
No, not like me.
Norman.
Alright, Miss... 
Crane.
That's it. 
Good night.
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
Then I'm free to go...?
Is anything wrong?
Please... I'd like to go...
Is there?
No need to apologize...
Now what?
Why?
Please.
Have you two had breakfast?
I suppose you want a cabin.
Better sign in first, hasn't we?
Haven't any.
I'll show you the cabin.
Fine.
I didn't think so.
I don't know what you've been saying.
...Forty thousand dollars!
Leave me alone!
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
Left Phoenix under her own steam?
From what?
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
Just before she died she came to--
Did she talk?
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
Indeed, he has often told me.
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
Okay--I'll be here at eight.
Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
I don't know, [I tell you].
Maybe you want my money, too.
Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
That's it. You get it quick.
Well, news of Buckley?
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
He isn't here.
No, you can't do that--they'll get suspicious--
The wound is bleeding!
Go to sleep!
I'm losing my blood!
Yes!
Nonsense! ... It's here! ... Your blood ...
A voice ...
That spoke to you?
That called ... commanded ...
What did it say?
The master ... is asleep!
Yes, the child ...
Yes.
There's no child here.
But ... the dogs...
No!  Good night!
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
I wish you wouldn't be so sarcastic about Ralph. He's the sweetest kid I know.
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
Then marry Ralph ... you'll be the happiest couple in the world.
I'll have it for supper.  So long.
Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
I won't let you say that!
Well, I do say it.
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
I'd call it stupid at any time.
That's the way I feel about it.
I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
At any time. You will always be welcome.
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
The body of Joan Gale!
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
It happens that I'm the law.
How quaint. But I can go any place you can. 
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
You give me a pain!
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
Nope, I'm through!
Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
Get out of here.
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
What!
Almost certain.
You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
I don't remember. Not so very far--
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
No, sir. About three months ago.
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
How's every little thing?
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
Do you know George Winton?
Old Howard Winton's cub?
That's the one.
They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
Thanks.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
That happens to be the truth.
Who'd steal her body?
No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it. 
Oh, is that what caused it?
Heaven knows. A lot.
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
You are asking to burn these people ... you are asking? ... 
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
Otto! You and one of those other fellows! Come help Professor Darcey.
Yes.
You have done well, and now I, too, have something for you. Come.
I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
He can't hear you.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
Day or night?
Okay.
Where to?
A place you've never been.
That's the physicist's playground.
It's an experiment.
What universe are you in, Paul?
A quantum one.
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
Is Rose here?
But who were they?
They were just bad men, that's all.
In what sense were they bad?
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
Did they try to induce you to become a prostitute?
There was this old man that ate his niece.
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
What did you expect?
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
Aw, be a good sport, Rose.  You like me, don't you? I like you a lot.
'Course it does.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
Buddy, you're just a child.
But Rose...
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
Buddy, Mr. Right is out there somewhere and I'm gonna find him!
You're my sweetheart.
Buddy, I'm scared, I'm scared!
Take a little walk with me, huh?
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
I do, too!
All right, what do you know?
Rose is madly in love with Daddy...
Well, a little.
No. Why should Rose be in my room?
The girl strikes like a cobra.
Yeah, he's still up there.
What's taking the rascal so long?
Daddy, what's the matter?
No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
What did you say, Brother?
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
What'd you say, Brother?
Oh, yes, it's Thursday.  Hello, Rose, dear...  ... my, you're... looking pretty...
No, he doesn't. Not really.
Yeah.
Yeah.
At least.
I can't see, let me see...
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
What are they doing?
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
What are they doing, Doll?
He kissed her.
He had his hand on her titty.
Let me look.  Aww-rr...
Buddy, that was my place.
Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
So am I.
Dumbness doesn't concern her, Doll. And neither does smartness. You see --
Here comes Daddy.
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
That's what she would say herself.
A wonderful woman, boy.
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
I think we both know her.
Yes, we know her.
What?
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
What time is it?
Quarter of twelve.
Is she all right?
I don't see any bruises or broken bones.
No reason at all, darlin'.
Yes, darlin', time will tell.
Darlin', it is not my fault if the girl has epizootics --
Boys? You say to me boys?
I'll talk to her, I'll reason with her.
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
Fine.
I'm afraid it's my fault. I made her feel guilty this morning --  Brother, what are you doing up?
Calm down, Rose, let's calm down and discuss it ...
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Is anything wrong?
No, sir.
Well, good night.
Got yourself up?
Yeah. I'm goin' out.
There are more on the other side.
Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
You don't know where you're going?
Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.
Yes, sir.
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
I'm not hungry.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
Well. What kinda job is it?
Your baby?
Good God almighty. This is a catastrophe, they won't hire her.
No, you're not.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
Nothing, Rose.
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
Yes. Well. She's upstairs.
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
More history, Rose.
Well, I am working on my thesis.
Yes, Ma'am.
Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe... one of 'em... was Foster... but I don't hardly know him!
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
No more dentists, no more dentists...
It'll get better now.
I don't mind.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
You're not gonna see him again.
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
Incestuous.
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Now you know what to watch for...
Careful she doesn't hit her head on the way.
Just entering.  We'll get to the breaking in a minute.
Abe Lincoln...
Again.
She's fine, as if you cared.
Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella.
What'd I say?
What, am I supposed to read it while I drive?  Keep a grip on it, alright?
Thank you, concerned citizen.
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
Whoa, thanks, man.  These are cool. They'll be collector's items.
Save it.  Just go.
What do you want me to do about it?
No you can't.
Get ready.
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
We should slow down.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
I got him.
Who's that?  Zimmermann's money-man?
Could be worse.  I don't know how, but I'm sure it could.
Well, they sure know how to hold a grudge.
Wh... what... ?!
The booze.
Dean Martin.
Entertainers don't count.
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
What about him?
What day is it?
Same day as before.  I think.
We're gonna rain on Zimmermann's parade.
Feeling great.
You don't smoke.
Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
Birth control's important.
No, but it should.
It's go time, Billy-B.
What was I supposed to do?
You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
We have to find Kittle.
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
No, we're stealing.
Can't you say something nice once?
I'm waiting till the time's right.
General Jim Beam, then.
Nope.
Go wherever you want.  Live how you want.
Bummer.
We've got the tape to prove it.
Not like this.  Are you even listening?
You going rogue on me?
Maybe.
Don't bother.  This behavior's gone on too long.  You're suspended.
You are such a disappointment, Benny.
Going into Zimmermann's pipeline.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
You know what I mean.
Absolutely.
Slow down.
No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
You think this is so easy?
Oh yeah?
Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
Out here.  On your knees.
Dead.
Just got here.
How'd we do?
A.D. is a C.P.A.
Your wish is my command.
I'm well aware of that.
Billy!  Billy!
Know what I love about dynamite?
Do tell.
Keep 'em busy.
Yeah.
It's one of a kind.
So are you, Pop-Sweet.  That's why...
Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
Yoda will always be with you.
But I have no sister.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Where am I?
Jabba's palace.
Who are you?
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
Luke!
Are you all right?
Fine. Together again, huh?
How are we doing?
The same as always.
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
Hi, Han... Chewie.
Yeah, she's comin' up.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
We got separated.
Leia!
I don't know.
Charges!  Come on, come on!
Here's the terminal.
He wasn't. I can feel it.
You love him, don't you?
Lando!
Lower it!
I'm trying!
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
All right, hang on.
Oh, Artoo, hurry!
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
Red Leader standing by.
Here goes nothing.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.
Your Royal Highness.
I see them. Wait, Leia!
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Tell me.
Vader is here...now, on this moon.
Your father?
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
Then you know why I have to face him.
But, why must you confront him?
So, you have accepted the truth.
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
I will not fight you, father.
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
I will not fight you.
Your father he is.
Yes.
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
Yes or no will do.
Oh. Well, yes.
How many languages do you speak?
Certainly not!
Oh well.  How about you.  
Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
On my mother's grave.
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
Rocky!
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
I've got something to say.
Uh huh.
For you.
Dammit, Janet.
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
It's just a..a party Janet.
Well I want to leave.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
Weiss.
It's alright Janet.
Oh don't be so shy.
Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
You know this earth - this person.
Yes.
A decision had to be made.
You're OK by me.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Makes you cry
Makes you cry
From Transexual Transylvania.
"Transylvania"
Now I
Want to come again and stay
Oh my, my,
Smile and that will mean I may

They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
And our World will do the Time Warp again.
...I'm sorry.
Ain't your fault -- Here's the problem.
Shell-shocked!
To you, to me it's Thursday.
I think it's closed.
Ohh!
Yes, I do.
You sure?
Yes.
I'll call your brother.
It's only temporary.
It's not that --
It's okay.
No, I don't belong here.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
They're all the same.
I should leave.
The glasses... Please.
Do me another favor?
Don't tease me.
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
I'll be waiting.
It did.
No... Sharp -- You look great.
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
...What's to say? I dunno what he wants from me --
...Yes --
I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
I gotta go out for a while.
...What?
...I can't beat him.
Apollo?
Yeah, I can't beat him.
...I dunno.
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
Christ.
You didn't!
That so.
Get outta my life both of ya's.
What?!
Give my main man a raise!!
...I don't feel heat from the name.
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
Get that doctor.
No doctor!
You're hurtin', man!
No doctor!... I'm feelin' good, bro!
One more round.
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
No, man, it's very smart.
Fouls.
...Still don't feel no heat.
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
Very high an' very fast.
She ain't retarded, she's shy.
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
Don't like yours neither.
Kiss my ass.
Move your shoulders down.
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
No wine.
Hey, give Rocky a dime.
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face!
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
...Ten minutes.
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
How 'bout some Cokes?
Cost ya a buck.
Charge it.
What's happenin' here?
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
Bob.
That's it, I'm broke.
That's it? -- Completely?
What about for food an' stuff?
Paulie's sister.
Do I have to pay juice?
Rocky.
Rocky, would you be interested in --
Excuse me.
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
What'd you say?
...Screw you, yoyo.
Stuff it, man!
I like yella teeth.
Makes your breath like garbage.
Maybe I like garbage.
I won't.
What was I gonna say?
'Night, Marie.
...What?
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
How old?
Come July, twenty-five.
More like thirty.
Yeah --
Did ya win?
Yeah, Kayo.
...Who'd ya fight?
Spider Rice.
Rice is a bum.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
...No.
Yeah, sure.
Message -- What message?
Here's the card?
When was they here?
'Bout an hour ago.
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
...I said that before.
Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
What's happened is freak luck.
Freak luck for sure.
Turtles -- domestic turtles.
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
Ya got heart.
Heart, but I ain't got no Tocker.
...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
Please, kid.
I never had good footwork.
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
Whatta you get outta this?
Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.
Damn! How's it look?
Fine... That guy's great.
Would you keep goin'?
...Yeah.
Great, kid, great.
It ain't your locker no more.
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
'Bout what?
He ain't losin' nothin'.
Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes!
Inventin' jokes ain't easy.
Ain't had time to check 'em.
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
Hey --
Ya always in a bad mood --
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
Maybe another job is the best thing.
Try again, c'mon, try again.
Ice skate.
I didn't want no turkey anyway.
He's takin' cheap shots.
It don't bother me none.
I'll do okay.
Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
...Tight.
I got whiskey here.
...No.
Ain't sure, what's the story?
The story -- what's happenin'?
Sure I like her.
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
What gaps?
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
To see ya train.
What can I do about it?
Do you feel you have a chance?
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.
Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!
You serve martinis, doncha?
Yeah...
So what's your next move, Valiant?
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
Shoulda guessed.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
A tweeting bird?
I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe.
Check the scrawl.
R.K. Maroon.
What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
Bastards put him on notice.
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
Got me.  But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.
Sounds like singin'.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
Surprised?
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
Toon cops worked me over.
Does it hurt?
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know who I could trust.
We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
He's right here in the...
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
Eddie, come on.
Doom.
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
So's the job.
Aren't you the lucky one...
As soon as is humanly possible.
Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
Have you got the will?
Maybe.  Why?
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
You tricked me, damn you!
Take it easy.
Aah!
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
Don't ever forget that.
Yeah, that's better.
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
I think you want a drink.  How about it, Judge?
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
My brother.  Get inside.
We can't do anything till it's dark.
Me.
Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
Get away from there.
No, it's not.
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
I rest my case.
... I'd head for Cucamonga.
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
From this box here...
I do bite my thumb, sir!
Uh? Uh?
Leave Me!
Then I'll leave thee.
Tempt not a desperate man!
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Romeo will answer it?
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
By my heel, I care not.
Is the day so young?
But new struck cuz.
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
Of love?
Farewell, my cuz.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Teach me how I should forget to think.
But 'tis no wit to go.
Art thou hurt?
'Tis he.
He shall be endured
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter now. We must entreat the time alone.
God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
Where is my Lady's lord?
Romeo, come forth.
Romeo, I drink to thee.
Madam, I am here. What is your will?
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
What?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
And so did I.
Well, what was yours?
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
A most courteous exposition.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Right.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
A Plague o' both your houses.
NO! Mercutio!
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
Do you really think so?
You know it is.
What?
Is that right?
Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
And I don't believe you...
The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this show.
That's why you were riding with him.
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
Not to me, you know that.
I thought I did.
That's him.
You lose them!
Not yet...
You were a soldier, were you?
Is that right?
That's right.
Duty calls?
Just business.
Don't even think that I'm buying that.
Bloody fucking hell...
Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
Ready when you are...
There's a problem...
Shut up!
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
Do you have the material?
You first, Edvard.
I think not.  After you...
Not so fast.  Who's that?
He's company.
Bad company...
What do you mean?
There's been a slight problem.
What's that?
In here...
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
You've told me a lot of things, boyo...
What's a little hate between business partners?
I swear...
Then where is it?
I sent it to myself in Paris.
Sent it where?
A post office box.
It's done.
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
Then I guess we're set.
There is one other thing...
What's that?
Don't cross me...
Nobody's going to do that!
Really?
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
And you respect him.
Of course.  Don't you?
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
You should really let a doctor look at that.
I didn't expect that he would.
Call it a reckoning of character.
Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.
Gets the job done.
Long enough to shoot back.
Is that right?
It's been known to happen.
My way is better.
Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
Eat shit and die slowly...
You should learn a little patience.
Is that right?
Who else would you be?
I know cops -- and you're no cop.
No thanks.
Let's just say he knows who I am.
Coordinate what?
I can do that.
That's what I thought.
As in, they own it?
Something like that...
I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
I asked if we could give him anything else.
Same thing, isn't it?
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
Who am I?
I just wanted to see something.
Know what?
I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own.
A lot of people died.
I've seen a lot of people die before.
I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?
You don't.  You just learn to live with it.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
You don't have to do this.
Yes I do.
You see the bullet?
Clearly.
I know of him.
Yes.
If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
Very ugly.
It is at that.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
You were behind the door?
Because I owe you.  Look at that...
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Business keeps you on the road?
Something like that.
No you don't, and you know it.
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
I think not.
Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
Just like that?
Would you stop with that...
Do you have a good answer?
No, I don't.
I'll work on it...
Finish the job...
Finish it!
What?
You speak French.
What of it?
Nothing...
You better get some sleep, alright?
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
Gone.  Destroyed.
I guess that's for the best.
You sure?
I'm sure.
It's the Irish tape we want.
Gonna be tough.
Why didn't you kill him?
You put everything on the line because you...
You slept with the fucker!!
I'm alright.  And you?
Doing well.  This is?
I might know where you could get a copy.
All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.
The Russian would be easier.
I can't get enough of it.
Don't lie to me!!!!
Sure thing, and --
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
Oh, you would have done great.
They're out of towners... Arizona plates...
What do you mean what are we going to do?
I mean -- Earl grabs Booth's arm --
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
Hell, it won't be us!
Why?
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
At the expense of six people.
Torch it?!
What's that?
What are you gonna do?
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
Okay then.  I'll do it.
That's not what I mean.
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
No we didn't.  He died on his own.
It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
Man take it easy!  You're sweating like crazy!
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
I don't know...
Okay then.  I'll do it.
Exactly.  This is our little secret, partner.
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
No.
Neither do I.
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
It's gonna be o.k.
Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
You don't know if he was really gonna --
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
Do you have everything?
I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
No we're not.
That's right.
Then Sally comes too.
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
He killed her...
It's NOT too late!
And you're solid on that?
Rock solid.
Why don't you get to the point.
My point, well...
By Friday.
You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
HELLLLLP!!!!
Hello.
Because someone may have gotten away.
Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
Denning was wearing a bug.
No.  But he would, probably.
I might have to look into that...
Hi.
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
OK.
Are you sure you're OK?
Yeah I'm fine.
That son of a bitch.
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
I know.
It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
I love you Sally.
I love you.
Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.
I swear to you, it's true...
You know I do.
What did he buy?
A week ago, at most.
Thanks for your time.
Yeah.
I have a better plan.
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
This just might be our ticket!
I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
What are you getting at?
Dwayne.
Did you say After Midnight?
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
Hi.
Well I just uh, you know...
Well I don't know...
Have I seen her?
Shopping here?
C?
Yeah I'd say C...C.
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Take it or leave it.
Yeah whaddya want?.
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
So be here at three.
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
I don't know...
What?
I can't hear a word you're saying!
I didn't say that.  You did.
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
Yeah let's hear about your day.
Dwayne put the gun down --
Shut up!!!  Slut!!!
Dwayne -
You'd do this to me!
Right behind you.
Listen -
I was on a roll!  Im a little overextended now.
Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
Hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
Is that the mail?
Well, same ol' same ol'.
Are you hungry?
Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
You've done without it long enough, ma.
Money.
Not in the trunk.
So...what's the good news?
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
You think he skipped town?
We're going to find out.
I'm not getting an answer.
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
How much is that?
Two-hundred thousand!
The band has been playing over an hour.
I got my sources.
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
How'd you know?
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
They think I'm a crooked customs agent.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
The real question is, where are the plates?  If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation.
I said get on your feet!
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
That's right.
You bring American money?
No.  It's my first time.
You pick any girl for you and your friend.
Oh yes, she's very nice.
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
I said that?  Which word was "goat?"
I knew you were lying.
I'm sorry.
Try to land on your feet.
I'm sorry.
How you doin'?
Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
Don't look at my ass!
Who died?
You.
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
Not Yu.  You!
Who?
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
No.  She's a school teacher.
You're not very good at this, are you?
Forget it.
IT IS CRAZY!
I know.  I know.  I am sorry.
You said --
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
He'll be back soon.
How do you know?
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
It's a long story.
I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring.
What did you say?
Nothing.  I said nothing.
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
Gimme the binoculars.
No.  It's not right.
Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
I don't want to hear this.
She's walking back towards the door.
It's your turn!
There's people up here!
Take it!
It's a bomb.
It doesn't matter.
Fine by me.
How was the sex?
What about a little king pao chicken?
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
Steamed dumplings?
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
Who's Benjamin?
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
Now that I believe.
End of the line.
You've been a good friend, James Carter.
Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
Wait here.  I'll handle this.
MMMMMM!!!!
No you didn't!
Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
What?!?!
Just GO!
No problem.
Yes.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
You take care of yourself, Lee.
It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
It's okay, I got lots more.
First class.
The Plaza Hotel?
A little Mu-shu.
Some Kung-Pao?
Amen to that, brother.
Excuse me?
I need your help.
I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.
Just trying to make it look real.
Look over there.  That's the eye in the sky room.
If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
I'm fine.
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
I still have my lunch money from third grade.
Are you okay, Lee?
There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor...
No.  He will report to me.  Do we understand each other?
Put a diaper on him, Chin.  I want to talk to the great Inspector Lee.
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
That's some serious poundage in dollars.
OK. Say what it is.
This is pathetic.
He was just doing his job.
So was I.
No.
A little.
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
We are both full of shit.
What?
I was being polite.
Witnesses.
Right....
I know a shortcut.
What plate?
The license!  You get it?!
No.
Did you make the plate?!
He was trying to kill me, not you.
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my ass again.
What?
Stool pigeon.
Come on!
Took off. Yes. They took off.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
Yeah, it's good.
Yes, I know this song.
You know War?
No, fish is a PM food.
Excuse me?
It's him.
Going into the restaurant.
This concrete?  This is still America.
What do you hear?
What?
The art.
You know him?
Oh, I think you like this very much.
Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.
Where'd you get it?
What's wrong with that?
OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.
Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
It's okay. For restaurants.
Yeah. So why you look do down?
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
At this point we don't have much.
How much they want?
Interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte.
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
Carter, shut up!
That's what you were supposed to be!
You a cop or something?
Or somethin'.
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
I'm waitin' here for a name.
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
Ambassador Han.
Yes.
She's fine.
Can I speak with her?
Han?
Yes.
It's Griffin.
Griffin?  Where are you.
I do.
Carter, can I have a moment?
Don't worry, he's with Carter.
Ike just came by to check out the team.
You bet ya, Coach.
Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
Maintain eye contact.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
It's hurting.
We'll rub.
He's here!... He's here!
"Make the shot."
"Nothing but net."
"Never say die."
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
What?
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Poor Ike.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
All the gory details.
Yeah.
Okay, we'll order out.
Then you'll be my best man.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
Why do YOU think she ran?
Oh, please!
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
I know.  Tell me something.  Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
Oh, I will.
No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
Looking for Maggie.
Yep.  Maggie -- Someone to see you.
No, she's talking about your hair.
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
Bye, Betty.  Thanks.
Oh, come on.  You're practically family.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
Excellent.
We'll see.
Twice...
Really?
Without oxygen...
We think so.
How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
Seven-fifty.
Five hundred.
Six-fifty.
Done.
You afraid to try?
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
Still sweet.
So?  Is that what you said to her?
You don't know.
No.
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
Bob will be very happy.
No.  You take it.
Can you fix it?
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
Well, they should.  Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
That was very interesting research George was doing!
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
I already explained about that.
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
A little longer for me.
Really?
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
I love you, too.
Well, you do have the dress.
And the church.
So am I.
So, we'll...
Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
Yup!
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
Why?
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
Lighten up, what?
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
I'm just finishing up, too.
No, I'm just going to head home.
Good boy, Port Hole.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
Thank you, Dad.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
A harmless joke.
No, you tell her.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
Nope.
I hate boats.
It sounds nice.
But it's on the water.
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
Am I what they had in mind?
They're going to love you.
My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
Even when you were young?
Nope.  Not even when I was young.
Happy New Year.
We'll stay at the Plaza --
Go to the Symphony --
It's delicious, trust me.
Does it have wheat in it?
I don't think so.
And then I'll see you in New York --
About forever.
No.
It's just like my grandmother's china.
It was my mother's.
Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
I told you.  Nothing --
At the top of the Empire State Building --
I think that's what I'm saying.
What?
Look!
About what?
Whatever it is.
What was what?
What's with you?
Nothing's with me.
Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
Can too.
No.
Yes.
Listen to this, I love this part --
I know.
Turn on your radio!
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
What?
Is this crazy?
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
Thank you.  I love you.
I love you, too.
Good night.
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
But he saw you, right?
He said hello.
So I mailed your letter.
What are your plans in New York?
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
No, I know that part --
You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --
I want my money.
Go home for the weekend.
Yes.
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
Howard.
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
Walter and I are engaged!
We'll move them --
Are his folks nice?
You know.
What?
Magic.  It was magic.
Magic.
You don't believe in signs.
Sure you do --
Magic.
Hello.
It's me?
The cabinets have to be redone --
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake --
It's been about a year and a half.
And I don't want to invade your privacy --
I don't think I could really describe it.
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
She died.
Why not?
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
Right, right.
What is it?
You'll see.
H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
It's Y. O. H.
Yeah.  What's that?
Your only hope.
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
I don't know.  Do I?
What is it?
We desperately need a spice rack.  Desperately.
It's never happening again. Right?
Right.
What?!
You're right.  You better hope so.
Oh, you're changing your mind --
No, I'm not, but --
What?
So I can go.
Sure.  Looking good.
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
I think I know how to have a spice rack.
Stressed.
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
I'm starting to notice that.
Will she scratch up your back?
Jed's got cables.
Go to sleep.
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
How do you know?
What was?
Is that what she used to sing?
Like do you believe in heaven?
Sleepless and Son.  Baltimore.
Now I'm late.  Bye.
Not now, Jonah --
Oh, right.
She's going to cook something for us?
It's only ten o'clock.
Jonah!
Thank Victoria for dinner.
I'm glad you liked it.  Good night, Jonah.
I thought I saw a black widow spider.
I was thirsty.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
That's true.  Why is that?
Everyone at work heard you.
I just called for a second.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
It's a short word.
Victoria? She's okay.
The one who wrote us.
It might be in the kitchen.
Yes.
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
Shut up.
You said we could go to New York.
Did too.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
No.
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
It was all they had.
What about it?
Do you like it?
Hi.  Sam?
Yes?
You must be Jonah.
What do you mean?
Hi.
You look good yourself.
I've already solved it.  I've hired a hit man.
He's good at it.
I read an article about this ...
I read the same article...
Your foreman says that's a foreman's job.
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
No thanks.
How's it going?
You haven't tried locking them up!
You want 'em all arrested?
I don't make policy.
I say we gotta take action. Now.
You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
It never ends.
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
An American.
No, Estellita.
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
They are singing for me.
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
Yes. We will light the candles.
Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
Got to talk to the brothers.
I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
What has it got me, your union?
If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
Aaah, what's the use?
No, no ...
Antonio paid for it.
I did forget. Lus told me.
It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
He'll have it good. Some day.
They say I am no good to you.
Over my dead body.
She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
Can be what?
Backward.
Sure.
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
Four nights. How did you sleep?
We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
Hunting.
When?
Sun up.
Alone?
No.
Ramn -- you can't.
Why not? I'm not needed here.
No. New York.
It's possible. Just negotiate.
I thought maybe you forgot...
Forgot what?
It's Mama's Saint's Day.
Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
Ramn ... listen to me ... I'm in a	jam ... I had to get a job ...
T! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
My kids don't have enough to eat!
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
Are you Australian?
No.
Good. I fucking hate Australians.
Shhh.
The spiders.
Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.

How about in the house?
No, Why?
Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
You like that?
First rate, ain't it?
It's downright classy is what it is.
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
Everything go?
Yeah.
I'll see you tonight.
I was thinking Alice Cooper.
Leave me out of this.
That bad, huh?
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
Nothing.
Go ahead.
I can't.
Why not?
You get off on abuse or something?
That's long enough to get out of town.
What happened to your eye?
How far out of town?
Trust me. We're safe.
Never heard of him.
It's the only way to play.
I try.
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
It gets me through the day.
You really need to lighten up.
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
How much time do you have?
What is wrong with you?
How much time do you have?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
You don't like the tune, find another station.
What are you hiding, Danny?
Therapy session is over.
No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
It's me.
You can still work.
He knows where I work.
I been that way ever since.
I just can't. Okay?
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
Danny, it's not what you think.
I don't want to leave you.
Your daughter needs you.  Go.
What?
Guess it's our turn.
Twelve
Midnight?
I know a guy.
Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
My features. They're Finnish.
You don't say.
Finland is a country.
You on a roll?
Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
I know a buyer.  Guy's looking for a quarter's worth.
A quarter of a million, Jimmy.
Can your man handle that?
Sure.
The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
Not tonight.
Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
I think on account of his nose.
You're going to have to explain that one.
He doesn't have one.
No  You think she's a tweaker?
No. I'm good.
Sure, Jimmy.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Was he the president?
Yes, Jimmy
Yes, Jimmy.
When? When did you ever see me use?
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
I can't tell you.
You don't trust me?
I don't trust anybody.
Understand what?
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
The good stuff.  Can you handle that?
No, I'm good.
Secret recipe.
Make me an offer.
Hey, okay.
Anything for a dear friend.
But I just met you.
If you say so.
Why do you say that?
Pull your pants down.
I'm sorry?
Pull your motherfucking pants down.
Big Bill.
Okay! Okay!
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
Just some buddies.
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
Yeah, dickhead.
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
What?
Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
Tell me what?
Question is, what are you doing here?
I was trying to score some dope.
Cut the shit, Flynne.
Bubba.
After that ass-whipping you gave me?
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
Whata you mean?  He told me -
I'm afraid so, Danny.
Who is it?
We got the 411 on your good old boy.
I thought you'd be happy.
Yeah.
My name is Tom.
Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ...  You're in the bathroom.  You've been shot in the shoulder ...
It speaks!
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
Turns out he's connected.
To who?
The Mexicali Boys
What?!
I still don't know what you're talking about.
Who the hell is Jimmy?
He's the only one I told.
Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
That would be me.
What'd you do, piss your pants?
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
What if he caps me before you can make a move?
You mean the menacing red car?
Worse. Much worse.  A teacher.
I was talking about Miles.
Really?
There's no motels around here.
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
You mean like the Donner Party?
What do you mean?
Look at that place. It's creepy.
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
Just admit you're wrong.
Why are you doing this?
Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
Don't we always take good care of you?
Maybe he isn't showing.
Better than drugs.
Don't worry about it.
No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
I thought you were done.
...alright, let me know when.
Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
Where are your men now?
As a matter of fact, I am.
Yep.
Not where I come from.
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
You take account of the wind?
The hell he didn't.
Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
Of course, sir.
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
I guess.
Nope, he ain't Wade.
What deal?
I'd love to hear it.
My guess, too.
Gives Wade the second shot.
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
Good, now get your goddamned gear.
Keep trying.
It's worth it.
To each, his own.
It was nothing.
Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
Sarge?
Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
It seemed appropriate.
Some.
Where are you from, Captain?
Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
A machine gun.
Plenty.
Same place we are.
You don't count.
Sure, you got one?
The Germans do.
I changed my mind.
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered.
Simpson.
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
Fresh out.
What about Talbot?
I've got a line on one.
Yep, hell of a mission.
PUSH!
Uh, Captain...
Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
Since when have things been normal?
Good news?
You never know.
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
It doesn't take this.
How about I go right, sir?
How about you take your position?
About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
Let's just find someplace.
You want me to take over?
Out of the mouth of babes.
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
But, sir...
I'm listening, sir.
Well, I, for one, like cheese.
Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
Easy for you to say, sir.  Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring his fucking neck.
We can't leave it here.
That's a mystery to me.
Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
What if our guys open up, sir?
OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN.
Get back to your positions!
I coach the baseball team, too.
That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.
Knows what that means.  He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.
Alright, come with me.
Yes, sir.
Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS.
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things.
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine.
Lingerie.
Yeah?  So?
Captain, he's fast!
Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother?
He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
Who knows?  It worked.
How can you, how can you say that?
No, no he's not.
Speak with my lawyer.
So you refuse to answer my questions?
Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
For going to school?
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Good for her.
I'll take the whole set.
Excellent.
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
You're sure?
Hey, sis.
Hey, bad throat, huh J-man?
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
I still am.
He's a mess!
I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
I'll be home soon.
What's a scam?
Going out as friends.
I'm gonna call her.
Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.
C'mon, just do it.
C'mon Lloyd.
Please?
That's just so embarrassing.
Please? COREY Alright. Alright, Okay, here.
Yes.
See you tomorrow.
See you.  Bye.  Bye Diane.
Read it.
I am.
If she wants me, she can come to me.
Come on, it's graduation.
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it.
What is wrong with this girl?
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
I can put that together.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
I'll put this past my boss
I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
You like it?
Oh yeah!
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
I'm sorry.
I love you dad.
I love you too honey.
Tell me, is it bad news?
No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
Okay, I give up.
Dad, I'm sorry.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
You're not listening to me.
I like him a lot.
Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
Swear to god.
I swear to god.
But I found the money.
Honey, it's not what you think.
What am I supposed to think?
Honey, about what?
I made their lives better.
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
You will?
Look at those eyes.
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Yeah.  What a day.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
No, I read it on the message.
Busy?
Are you busy on Friday?
Yeah, I have to help my father.
Pardon me?
I'll go.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
No.
Yeah.
It's the worst job since keymaster.
Bye.
Nobody knew me before tonight.
Yeah.  I'm so glad we did this.
You know what?
What?
Job?  Being a great date.
No, I'm serious.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Then call me tomorrow.
Today is tomorrow.
Then call me later.
Yeah?
You think so?
Mmmm.
Come on.
Okay, bye, I will.
I'll see you there.  Bye.
Okay.
What did you say?
Well... just meet her.
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
Yeah.  With potential.
Friends with potential.
Am I wrecking my car?
Yes.  Are you shaking?
No.
You're shaking.
I don't think so.
You're cold.
I don't think I am.
Then why are you shaking?
I don't know.  I'm happy.
It did?
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
Why didn't you tell me?
It was wonderful.
How do you know what I'm going to say?
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
How can I look at you and say this?
You need to study?
Yeah.
Okay.  It's good knowing this.
We decided...
Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
Yeah you do.
No I didn't.
Did you talk to Corey?
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
Just my dad.
You told your dad?
Oh shit.
I'm sorry.
What do you want?
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
What?
I love you.  Please, I love you.
No.  You just described every great success story.  Alright, it's alright.
You've gotta get her out of your head, man.
Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
Uh... okay... um...
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
The guy with the Datsun?
No.
The truck?
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
How ya doing?  Is she around?
Yeah.  Honey?
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
I'm totally and completely serious.
No, really.
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
She's very successful.
I know
Very talented.
I know this part, keep reading.
Your car?
Dude, I can't do it!
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
Hey.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
What?
How you doin', brother?
A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
Diane, everybody loves that you showed up.
I love you too.
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
We're full on bonded.
Yeah, alright.
He is.
Sir, the list is correct.
Oskar, please -
What -
War.
It's a beautiful city.
It's up to you.
I'm sorry to hear that.
In Breslau.
Good.
They're mine!
Yeah, what's that?
I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
I don't know.  Soon.
These people, my people, I want my people.
You're not telling me something.
You did, but you didn't.
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
This is not my problem.
Look it up.
Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
God bless you, sir.
Yeah, okay.
You're a good man.
There's nothing in the stores.
Yeah.
Things are great, things are great.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.
I need a drink.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
It kind of looks that way.
Something they can hold in their hands.
Better this month than last?
Yes.
Ah, yes.
It's dangerous.  It's dangerous, to me, personally.
I think it's too late.
Yes.
Stern.
They arrived, can you believe it?
You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
No, no, what, what is it?
You did so much.
He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
Take the neighborhood.
The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
They've broken their pattern.
You're sure about this two person thing?
Don't. Think Bailey.
Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
What is it?
I heard a noise.
Where?
That's smart.
What? I can't hear you...
Hang up...call...
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
Cici. Who's this?
Someone who wants to talk to you.
Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on.
What if I said goodbye?
Why would you wanna do that?
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
I had to change. Did anyone call?
Just some asshole trying to scare me.
Can we talk?
I don't think that's a good idea.
I did that.
It helped me realize one thing.
Not until youre dead.
Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
And much richer as a result.
Do I know you? You look familiar.
I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
Where is Sidney's father?
Home--where he lives.
And are the police sure about that?
Why don't you ask them?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
Finish what my son started.
But youll never get away with it.
What's your subject?
I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
Where's Sid?
She dumped me.
No way.
Yeah.
You freakin?
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
Sid, you don't have to.
The forbidden subject.
I think it's out of your control.
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
No. This is a set up.
Thats quick.
Youre not going to get away with this.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
What guy?
Randy somebody.
Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
I got it..
He hates Oliver Stone.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
Or it found us.
Tuitions expensive.
Miss Weathers.
I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
I never meant to imply...
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
Yeah?
Not good.
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
Can we turn the light on?
That's not the way it's done.
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
We'd break some furniture.
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Let's find out.
Over here.
He filmed his victims.
No, wait here.
There's nothing. I'm coming down.
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
Oh my God. How could it happen?
I'll give you one guess.
I don't play games.
What if your life depended on it?
I'm everywhere.
Stay away from the cop.
It's what you want from me.
Watch your back.
It's good to see you involved.
Oh my God.
Yes, goddammit!
I dont know.
I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20.
I have to watch rehearsal.
Too bad.
Is Sid in therapy?
But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.
Hello?  Hello?
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
What about rehearsal?
Gotta.
Yeah, right.
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
I'd really just like to be alone.
It's not a good idea, Hallie.
I counted four.
Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
Easy black boy.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
Thanks, Joel.
But...
..it's really about family and tradition...
..harmonica style is okay.
Gale?
She's not here right now.
But she's standing right next to you.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
But...
Now.
I get scared really easy, okay.
We can still Sandra Bullock it.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
Where you going?
Don't panic.
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
Hello.
Who is this?
Who is this?
Asshole, Can't talk.
But your voice sounds so familiar.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
What kind of a game?
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
Good bye Ben.
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
Closer than you think.
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
Well you'll find neither. Rina Reynolds, however, You will.
There's more.
Yes well we have a suspect, so don't get that worried.
Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
Absolutely.
You mean like, movie trilogies?
You seem to like movies, Detective.
To me Hollywood is about death.
Excuse me?
Catch him, or kill him.
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
Is that a threat?
What Rielly?
The killer called her.
What?  When?
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
No.
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Sid I can see you!
They've got her!
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
You used to say that was our strength.
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
Always.
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Gale, your engine's still running.
Fuck!
Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
What?
GALE BEHIND YOU!
Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Just Jennifer.  And you.
Do you want us to come with you?
Nevermind, what'd you two find?
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
Oh shit it's my cell!
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
No really?
There a story in that building?
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Good twist.
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
Just because you knew her?
Yeah.
Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
I know! He killed Kincaid!
I know!
Let's get out of here!
Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at your   music video awards.
What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!
Page 22, Candy's big moment.
Hello.
Who's this?
Who's this?
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
I'm hanging up right now.
It's Sarah.
My movie.
I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
W-what do you want?
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
Are you sure?
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
No I need to call you. Just you.
I'm sorry, your voice.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
Sorry.
No one's saying you did.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
You know it.
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
Yeah...
No, it's not.
She looked dead. Still does.
Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
Where the fuck did she go?
You rode your bike out there?
Yes, sir.
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
What are you doing here?
I'll only stay a sec.
What are you doing here?
He's here. He's trying to kill me...
Hey, hey, it's just me.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
Or even a good porno.
What?
Are you serious?
Yeah... I think so.
What?
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
It's okay. Give me the gun.
Stop it!
Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
Who is this?
What number is this?
What number are you trying to reach?
I don't know.
I think you have the wrong number.
It happens. Take it easy.
So why did you dial it again?
You're forgiven. Bye now.
Wait, wait, don't hang up.
They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya.
What's that noise?
You're making popcorn?
Uh-huh.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Do you like scary movies?
Uh-huh.
What's your favorite scary movie?
You have to have a favorite.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
So, you gotta boyfriend?
Why? You wanna ask me out?
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
That's not what you said.
What do you think I said?
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Nah, I don't think so...
Don't hang up on me.
Gotta go.
To talk.
Dial someone else, okay?
You getting scared?
No-bored.
More of a game, really.
They'd never make it in time.
TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.
So you better leave.
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
Guess.
Why are you doing this?
No...
Then he dies. Right now.
Which is it?
Turn off the light.
Come on. It'll be fun.
No... please.
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
Don't do this. I can't...
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
No...
Come on, yes you do.
Please..stop...
I can't think.
YES!
NOOOO....
But you're doing so well.
Then answer the question. Same category.
No it's not. It was Jason.
Afraid not.
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
He's not a suspect, is he?
We haven't ruled out that possibil...
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
What brings you out to these parts?
You never know when or where a story will break.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
Mind if I join you?
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
Can I bring Kenny?
What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a meteorologist...
I don't think you're so bad.
Sidney's father?
I'll get my camera.
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene.
Hold up a sec...
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
You're sure it was the Hilton?
At the airport.
We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
Yeah.
Afraid not.
Should I be worried?
Not yet.
How is everything?
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
He's her boyfriend.
What were you doing out here?
How is she?
She's tough.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
I told you to send it back.
What is it? Where's Casey?
Casey? Casey?
Not my daughter... not my...
Jesus! The camera-hurry!
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
About thirty seconds.
It'll be out later this year.
Just stay back.
I want to talk to you.
Kenny. Camera. Now.
Forget it.
I owe you shit.
Have you talked to Cotton?
Many times.
Has his story changed?
For attention. The girl has some serious issues.
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
So who are you?
Your front porch.
Right here.
Uh-huh.
What am I doing?
If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
Hello Sidney.
I heard screaming.
No you didn't.
...so call if you need me.
Got it.
Sleep tight, sweetie.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Don't shoot. It's me.
Before she dumped him for Steve.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
It would certainly improve your high school Q.
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
We had a run in the mass murder section.
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
She's saving herself for you.
It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.
I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
He came to make up.
There goes my chance with Sid.
Like you had one.
Yeah.
I'll be right back.
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
Why are you doing this?
It's all part of the game.
The official term is "psychotic".
You'll never get away with this.
What happened?
How do you gut someone?
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
Later.
It's past seven.
Bye.
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
Just like old times, ain't it?
No, nothing's like it used to be.
He was there, Tatum.
I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
I bet he's pissed.
It was him, Tatum. I know it.
Come on. Pathos has it's perks.
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
Come on, let's rock.
I don't know, they just did.
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
I did. He's full of shit.
Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?
Thank you.
He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
You're wound too tight, Mills.  Let it go.
I'm in.
So what?  This victim...
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
No, I haven't heard.
There was a second.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
Good.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
You know.
It's always been like this.
I read about it in the paper.
What?  What?
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
What the hell's going on?
Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
I'm... I'm just delivering a package.
Hello.
It's not too far away now.
Why?
Her pretty head.
NO!
Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
A woman...
Murderers like you?
And, why is that?
It's close.
What the fuck is going on?
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
I realize that.
For now.
No one yet.
What?
Is there any blood in it?
I don't know.  Feel free to look for yourself, okay?
Guessing at this point is useless.
This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.
Can we talk about this in private?
Tonight.
What about them?
I read.  Remember reading?
I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
We put her in a safe house.
Punishing.
Did you read them?
Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
Nothing.
Totally unrelated victims.
I know.
It's got to be.
A switchblade.
We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
Bear with me.
I wish I still thought like you.
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
You tell me.  I'm new in town.
Satisfy our curiosity?
Call an ambulance.
No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
Oh, it's alright.
Who pays the rent on time.
This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
Yes we do.  Here...
I don't know... like fifty.
I don't.  Neither do you.
We're focusing.
The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.
It's not what you think it is.
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
Saint Thomas Aquinas.  He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
That's what it says.  Jonathan Doe.
This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.
We'll take a look at him.  Talk to him.
Who told you about my silver tongue?  You been talking to my wife?
I'm fine.
What happened?
You can't go in there.
We have probable cause now.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Think about how we got here!
No point in arguing anymore...
We had him.
I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
Where's the victory?
No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
When do we get to question him?
Give me a break.
Wait!
What are you talking about?  What happened?
What did you say?
I can't let you do this...
Put the gun down, Somerset!
I don't see anything.
Are you absolutely certain?
I can't do this now... please.
What?
No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.
It surprises me.  It really does.
Too long.  What do you think so far?
I don't sleep very well.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
I don't know...
This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
I don't know.
How should I know?
But Mose Harper said...
It just happened to be me...No need to make any more of it...
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
Why don't you finish the job?
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
I ain't wearing no gun.
In that case, give the boys room...
Dunno...Seems so.
Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
Well, swear him out again!...I'll go with you.
Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
You fit a lot of descriptions.
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
...like a flower and is cut down... <U>Amen</U>!
By what you preach...none!
Just keep goin'...
How far's the river from here, Mose?
Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
Captain Clayton...Captain!
I'm Clayton.
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
You lie! All white men lie...and kill...
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
Told ya, didn't I?
Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
Seven Fingers...ay-eh...Seven...
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
That's what I said.
You got it with you?
I beg your pardon?
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Leggo...
Huh...?  Sure I'm all right...
Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
Good night...
YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
He just couldn't wait...
Whatchu doin'?...
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
Nine...  Ten!
What's the sense in it!
What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
We won't be here...Come on!
What's goin' on?
You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
I got your boy killed.
Don't go blamin' yourself...
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
You've seen her!...She's alive?
I've seen her...and she's alive.
That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
Ain't worth the mendin'...
Wouldn't bother me...  I wouldn't try it in front of pa, though, was I you...
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
You crazy?
I got to fetch her home...
We got two around that age...
Come on, say it.  You know...
"With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
What else should I do, damn it, he's dying!
Oh God, Tommi...
You'll never get away from me!
Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget...
It still worked in town.
I mean the armchair!
Oh, damnit!
In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.
Do you have a better idea?
I'll do it myself.
My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
Making our very own solstice fire.
I just had a really strange experience.
What?
So do I, believe me.
Someone from the village.
Yeah... I have to go to town.
No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
In the village.  Look what I found.
Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
What? What am I supposed to sense?
The house - Tommi - something just doesn't jive here...
I haven't the slightest idea.
Hi, darling.
We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
Does this dog here belong to you?
Do I look like it that much?
Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
I've killed my husband!
What?
Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
We should leave the past alone.
Yes, something was...
Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".
Very funny.
It's good.
Oh
The title won't do.
Ah
Thank you, Ned.
And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
Right you are, governor!
Sir Robert De Lesseps.
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
You have the last act?
You have the money?
Tomorrow.
Wait!  Will you desist!
Twenty pounds on delivery
No Juliet?!
See you in jail.
What is the chief part?
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
The title?
Romeo
How much?
Ten pounds.
You're a liar.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
Nothing comes.
Most interesting.
Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?
A goodly length in times past, but lately
No, no. You have a wife, children
On my mother's side the Ardens
No, your marriage bed.
yet cannot love nor write it.
Who is that?
Yes, I saw it.
Take his feet out. Where will you get
Put his feet in.
It's a comedy.
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
There's never any
Of course not!
Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
Very well.
Yes, but very well.
it will be all right, madam.
What happened to Sam?
Who are you?
Thomas Kent!
Every word.
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
God be praised!  Locked?
As soon as I have found my muse
She is always Aphrodite.
Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
Fifty pounds? What for?
To my weekly confession.
To the Palace at Whitehall.
Is it about a pirate's daughter?
Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
Romeo.
No, it will turn out well.
How will it?
I don't know, it's a mystery.
What do we do now?
The show must  you know
Go on.
I don't know. It's a mystery.
How goes it, Will?
Wonderful, wonderful.
Burbage says you have a play.
I have. And chinks to show for it.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
And yours?
Romeo isItalian. Always in and out of love.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
Do you think?
The daughter of his enemy.
The daughter of his enemy.
I thought your play was for Burbage.
This is a different one.
A different one you haven't written?
"Is the day so young?"
"Not having that which, having, makes them short."
"Of love?"
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
Will you ask Her Majesty to be patient?!
I will.
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
Be still.
I am not so well-born.
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
Stand up straight, girl.
What do you love so much?
Your Majesty
Above Lord Wessex?
I have lost my gift.
Burbage has my keeping but you have my heart.
But your voice  Have they dropped?
Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam?
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
"Parting is such sweet sorrow"
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
"Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly urg'd. Give me my sin again."
"She speaks.
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
"The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine."
So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
I have, Master Shakespeare.
But the plague
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
I'll be damned if you are!
I have to get back.
Who is there?
Will Shakespeare!
The same, alas.
Oh but why "alas?"
A lowly player.
If they find you here they will kill you.
You can bring them with a word.
Can you love a player?
It is strange to me, too.
Even your play.
Oh
Well perhaps better than my first. 
It was the owl--come to bed
Mr. Henslowe?
Oh--no, no!
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl.
I must. I must
Yes, some of it is speakable.
Oh, but it is mine too!
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
I know how to fight!
A literary feud. Quite normal.
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
I don't know. It's a mystery
My lord.
I have spoken with your father.
So my lord? I speak with him every day.
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
It was your eyes. No, your lips.
The Queen has consented?
It is not my riding day, my lord.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
I am going to church.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
My hat?
Wait there.
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
No, sir.
Of course you have not! I have not written it!
And break her heart and mine?
It is only ours you can know.
She loves me, Thomas!
Does she say so?
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
Are you bringing your laundry woman?
A man, my lord?
By God, I'll fight the lot of you
I don't know -- Campbell or something?
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
Just serve.
In the same fashion as chess.
Will you shut up and play.
You're a bad loser.
Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
About what?
About this guy, this Hugo person.
I don't have time.
Why, thank you, David.
Alex, I don't have the time --
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
Think about it.
No.
Come on, David.
No.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
He couldn't get his car started.
When are you going to let the police know?
You call them if you want.
And what about you?
Dig the pit, I don't know.
No, not that.
Then what? Who's going to do what?
You know what I'm talking about.
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
You know what. Who's going to do it.
I don't hear this.
I won't be able to.
Take his legs.
But not quite.
Is that going to be deep enough?
Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
Can we talk about something?
Not now. I have an idea.
I want to talk now.
After.
I don't know.
I don't know.
How much?
I don't know.
Security.
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
There was a break-in.
Downstairs, I know. Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six.
Oh, that'll come in useful.
You're sure? There's lots more.
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
Nothing.
Not eating what?
If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
Looking for you? Yes.
Your friends.
It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
Where do you think you'll go?
Where will we go? Where will we go? Juliet?
I don't know anything about it.
But there's no --
Don't know what?
This is just an informal discussion.
Are you recording it?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
No. Why should it?
Well, then?
Take another look at these two.
I don't know them.
What?
Parked outside?
That's all?
Sorry to waste your time.
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Just one thing.
Yes.
What?
Yes, thanks.
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
And you like it?
Oh, yes, it's great.
Cameron?
Really?
Just serve.
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
Well, she had problems --
Not usually this drunk.
-- instead of what he is --
What I am.
-- which is --
-- which is a hack.
Yeah.
I think you're lying.
You're right.
No. Any idea which channel he's on?
So I gathered.
Maybe he didn't like us.
David?
Hugo.
His car's still there.
So what's wrong with that?
What sort of car?
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
Open it.
Now?
Yes.
All right. No problem.
Did what?
What? What's wrong?
What are you doing?
I'm just looking.
Don't.
Don't look?
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
What?
Unfeasible.
Is that all?
I thought we all were.
I don't thinkI can.
I don't want to. It's different.
And now you tell me.
David?
For ever and ever.
It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
No, I don't.
What's he doing here?
That's not him.
Who was it?
No.
Then let's spend some money.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
Don't you?
He can't stay up there.
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
What are you doing here?
We have to talk.
Your painful groin?
David?
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
Oh, good.
We could put it somewhere.
Where he can't get it?
Now you thought of that, not me.
Forget it -- he'll come down.
No.
Oh.
I refuse.
You're frightened.
I'll wait there.
What?
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
We were just sorting things out.
That's what I thought he said.
The perfect couple, I should say.
You mustn't take it so badly.
No.
Let him go. Let him take it all.
What?
What?
You mean I can have the room?
Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
It's about the burglary.
Downstairs.
Of course.
Can we come in?
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
There are only two other people in the flat.
Who said there were four?
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
You're sure of that.
Yes.
That wasn't a question.
Do you smoke?
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
That was stressful. I found that stressful.
Two hundred pounds?
Two hundred pounds.
That's what it cost, David.
What?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
No.
No one. I promise.
Who have you talked to?
No one.
If I think you're lying --
With a face like this?
I should hope so.
It was on the television.
You and me?
And you need your sleep.
Right here?
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
Exactly what I was --
Not any real sneering as such, no.
But they sneer, don't they?
You get the job done.
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
Which is why I'm trusting you with this account.
What guy?
That guy, the one that died.
That one, last week.
Here?.
Oh, him. Well, he died.
That's what I thought.
You must be Juliet.
I'd be delighted.
A priest who dies.
I see.
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
It's a breeze.
The telephone? It continues to ring.
All right.
Did he sound upset?
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
I'm a doctor.
And he's a patient of yours?
No. But he needs treatment.
For what?
A certain weakness.
You know about it?
And that's not the same thing?
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
Look again if you like.
I suppose so.
I mean, that's what it's like.
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?
Is it real?
Or a fake?
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
Chicken salad, Devra!
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
No, it's a very groovy girl.
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
What're you talking about, George?
That kid... the hairdresser.
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
What?
What do you expect me to do about it?
I just thought you'd like to know --
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?
That's okay too.
-- think what you have time to think, Lester.
My keys.
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
Why not?
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
Yeah, I think so.
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
I don't know.
Gee, that's very serious...
I know.
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
She did?
It turned out to be cancer.
I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.
I'll be back in a while.
I don't want to see you anymore.
I'll be right back, baby, really.
I gotta talk to you.
I don't want to talk about it...
But you don't know what happened.
I don't care.
Nummers.
What?
I don't want to place you in any position --
-- to be put in that kind of position...
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
What kind of treatment?
Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts...
You're looking great, baby.
What're you doing later?
Whatever you say.
Your husband?
Yes.
What about?
I don't know. Just a minute...
I hope she's all right.
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
No, I know.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
I know.
That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.
Hello, George.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
No, baby... I'm glad you're coming tonight.
Right now, I just don't care.
She what?
She's a friend of Jill's.
And who's Jill?
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
... what?...
That headboard.
Nobody can hear it.
Uh-uh.
Let it ring.
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
You know what I'm talking about.
Are you?
No.
Then it's not your problem.
It isn't?
I guess so.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
God, I adore you.
Hello.
A little.
I do her hair, yeah.
Chopped liver?
No thanks.
Did you hear me?
Yeah.
Gee, this is great.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
See if you've been making it with my mother.
What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
I asked you first.
Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
Am I what?
Making it with my mother?
Don't make conversation with me.
What?
No kidding.
You think that's funny, don't you?
Then what do you think?
That you're just like your mother.
I am not like my mother!
I am not!
You are.
Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?
Yeah.
How is she?
Great.
Wonderful woman.
And you need money?
Right, that's right.
Well, yeah... you know.
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Pardon me?
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
I mean credit references, Mr. Roundy.
Yeah.
I've got heads here, Norman.
You promised you'd do the show.
Oh fuck, Norman!
You are today.
Great. Who's been doing your hair?
-- Yeah... your car down here?
Jill's really great, isn't she?
Great... so how's everything with you?
He's a very private person, actually.
You going to tell him?
-- What for? Honey, I'll see you later.
Probably the bathroom.
Can't you do it out here?
I'd cut it...
Yeah, I think so...
No, I'm sure.
Great.
Yeah... I mean great.
What's wrong?
It's hot in here.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
The shrink? Many times.
Do you? You still see him?
Why not?
And what?
Did you?
No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
What?
Did you?
Did I what?
You know what I'm talking about.
Hey, I don't tell.
One of my few virtues is discretion.
You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
Yeah, baby...
You're a genius.
I don't want to... I swear...
I know... you don't know, I know.
Don't, don't, don't...
What are you talking about?
Sit down!
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
He's a director.
Jackie, can we --
Fuckin' A --
You were great.
You don't think so? I do.
You were great.
I am you, you little bastard.
He never stopped.
Am I entertaining you?
We're friends.
-- sure.
-- oh I thought you were --
-- what?
Nothing.
-- mmm --
-- ass and legs --
Look who's talking.
Me?
-- yes, you --
-- do you want ice?
-- we are?
Lester's on his way.
Please, we'll have to talk later --
Look about last night --
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
That's it, then I'm leaving.
No --
It's too late...
I don't know... Jackie?
What?
I don't know -- I've got to.
-- Right after I sprayed her?
What?
Oh yeah?
Don't talk like a child. You're a pro, now get out there and cut!
Wash her.
What with?
-- Oh my yes.
-- Otis?
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
-- please, please forgive me...
-- you know better...
-- why did you come in today?
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
-- how did you get here?
-- took a bus.
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
-- yeah, this is --
-- yes, George.
Okay... thanks...
That's too bad.
I have to see you.
Hey, stop by the shop.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
What're you talking about?
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
Where?
Here in the canyon.
I just... who what?
You said somebody... who?
George, I don't --
Keep moving --
Now, George --
Nobody's gonna get you but me!
Fine. How are you?
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
You're different.
I am?
You're great.
I am?
Do you really mean that?
Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with you.
Yeah, baby.
Why am I great?
We live together now.
Of course I like children.
You've never even been around one.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Okay...  Night, baby.
George?
What!
Hello.
Could I?
Egypt!
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
Great... can we talk later?
I already said hello.
Okay.
George.
Yeah, baby.
When can I talk to you?
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
Whether or not I'm going.
Going where?
Egypt.
No, but I think they might.
Just a second, I'll be right with you...
Your advice!
I want your feelings about it.
Right now?
When is that?
I'll call you.
When is that, George?
I'll call you.
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
... Okay...
Where's your car?
A friend dropped me off.
Who?
Never mind. Where've you been?
A business meeting, I told you that.
Look at the way I live.
Ha, ha.
Television or movies?
Commercials.
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
-- well aren't you --
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
-- okay --  -- I'll see you later. Your house.
I do, Jill.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
Well that's something.
I'm very tired, George.
Let go of me.
Yes.
Where did this come from?
Obviously there were others, weren't there?
What do you wanna know for?
I just want to know, that's all.
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
-- no, it'll help me, really --
How?
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
Does it make you happy?
Yeah, I know. Did you?
George, now cut this out.
Did you?
Stop it.
Did you?
Yes, yes, I did.
What did you say?
George...
What did you say?
I said you were a loser!
-- A wash and set.
No.
No?
You need a cut.
But Mr. Norman said --
Said what!
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
Thank you.
Yes it is.
But what?
When?
What about, tonight?
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
I know it, I know it.
... this doing hair it's...
Son, we'll do business, I can tell you that.
Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
Well... who are those guys?
What do they look like?...
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
Godammit, George...
Now wait a minute...
Sit down.
But...
I said sit down!
Oh Jesus Christ.
What can I say!
What, do you think I planned it?
Did they have something against me?
Didn't they tell you?
I wanna hear it from you!
Why, why do you think that is?
Well, I don't know.
No thanks.
Have a drink.
I'll have to wash one out.
Me!
What about her?
I mean, how did that happen?
Lester, it just happened.
No --
Yes I do.
Wasn't sure it was you.
All right, who're you with? Jill?

No.
Awww --
I'll call you back.
Come on by.

Okay, okay...
Yeah.
I'm coming over.
I'll call you back.
No you won't.
What do you mean?

Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
A daytime soap opera.
And?
I was too old.
What was it, somebody's daughter?
Somebody's mother.
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
Yes.
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
Is that right?
Is that right?
No kidding? Your own shop?
Who were you talking to?
My secretary saw you with that boy.
That's not very logical, Lester.
What's that?
You're still jealous.
Oh, I'm sorry.
They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Jesus, she's my best friend.
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying -- George --
You know what's wrong.
Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
Jackie, what're you doing?
Oh yeah?
I'll call you.
Fine.
Anyway, you're crazy.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
So what's your point?
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
I know, I'm sorry.
-- No. No really.
Well, what is it, honey?
Nothing.
It must be something.
Well, it's George.
But you have problems?
-- Yeah, honey...
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
Jackie --
What?
Honey?
What?
-- He reached up and tore them.
What did you do?
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
That's right.
But why Egypt?
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
Sure.
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
Well he's not exactly a friend.
Is he an enemy?
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
-- sort of a boyfriend?
Sort of.
-- never mind.
Good for you.
He's a hairdresser.
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
I don't think so.
Well did he go in there with Jackie?
George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
-- oh I don't know --
You mean when are you going to Egypt?
You're going?
You're going.
-- he'll never know the difference.
I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
-- there's not much room --
That's fine --
Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
Thank you.
-- just wonderful.
Three weeks.
Do you have children?
Are you married?
No.
John...
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
Thanks for coming by.
Everybody but us.
-- we're going to be here all night.
Where to, Les?
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
Yes?
I'm hungry.
What was the Donner party?
They had to, in order to survive.
Okay.
Yes, Dad.
Yes.
Do you feel bad?
Then why don't you go to sleep?
Do you like this hotel?
What?
Are you sure?
Yes, Dad.
Good.
French Fries and Ketchup.
I'm not supposed to.
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Who's Tony?
Is Tony the one that tells you things?
Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
Try to think what it was.
Room 237?
You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Yeah, I know.  It always takes a little time to make new friends.
Danny, come on over here.
Okay.  You behave yourself.
Yeah.
Yes?
I won't make any noise.
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Red Rum.
Are you having a bad dream?
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Danny, come here!
Mommy... Mommy...!
Danny!
Oh!
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
Is Tony one of your animals?
No.  It's the little boy that lives in my mouth.
Why not?
Where does he go?
Yes, I'd like you to.
Thank you.
Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
Well how can I repay you?
It's okay, really.
Delbert Grady.
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
He is, Mr. Torrance.
A nigger.
A nigger!
A nigger cook.
Grady... oh.
You give your word on that do you, Mr. Torrance?
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
All right, sir.
Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
Good.
Sound good to you, Danny?
Pleasure to meet you.
What line of work are you in now?
Well, I'm looking for a change.
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
Women!  Can't live with 'em.  Can't live without 'em!
Good evening Mr. Torrance.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
What'll it be, sir?
Your money's no good here.
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
Yeah.
It's about eleven thirty.
Lots of ideas.  No good ones.
Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy.
I dreamed that I... that I killed you and Danny.
No, nothing at all.
And you didn't see anything at all?
Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
I think he did it to himself.
Yes.
How do you like it?
I can't really remember.
You can't remember.
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Jack...
Of course you are.
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Why?
I'm not going to hurt you.
Wendy!
Stay away...!
Stay away from me!
Stop swinging the bat.
Stay away from me.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Wendy give me the bat.
Stay... stay away!
Give me the bat.
Give me the bat.
Stop swinging the bat.
Get down.
Go away from me.
Go away.
Give me the bat.
Go away.
Give me the bat.
Wendy...
I'm gonna go now.
Wendy...
Yes?
I'm Jack Torrance.
Oh, well - come on in Jack.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
Well, that's very good time, very good.  Please sit down a minute.
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
Not for me.
Great...
Well, my predecessor in this job
Well, that is eh quite a story.
No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?
All the best people.
Thank you, Susie.
Hi.
How're you getting on?
How do you do?
Jack is a schoolteacher.
Eight thirty.
Uncle Al-
Blue. This blue.
Jesus.
Sure, Uncle Al.
If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
Let me help you up.
Jane, I have to talk to you.
Will you?
Jane-
You're a real booger, you know it?
Well... it is his third.
What?
What kind of noises?
Rattling. Rustling.
Rats...
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty?
Yeah.
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
Do I need one?
Good.
Save this one for last.
A tracer. You'll like it.
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
What the hell does that matter?
Well... was it a prescription?
Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?
Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.
It could have been anything, Marty.
And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
You're not going to let it go, are you?
I saw what I saw.
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
I said I was a nun, not an asshole.
What you say?
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
I think I hear it!
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
You know, I just might!
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
You know what we're saying!
LET THY SPIRIT
I think they hear you!
Yes, Mary?
HE'S SO FINE...
Were you tempted?
SING! SING AND YOUR SPIRIT WILL SOAR!
And I'm tearful!
SING!
'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
Then stop trying to memorize it.  Hit the road.
With love.
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
You can handle this.
What?
Who?  The other woman.  Your wife.
Vince...
Yes?
Thanks.  A lot.
Good evening, Vincent.
I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I forgive you.
Yes, Betty?
This prom is a real drag.
Oh-huh.
Oh my! 
What is it, Betty?
HE'S SO FINE.
I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes?
Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
You betcha.
I love my heddles.  Show me again.
I know.  It's ancient.
It's a rhythm section.  The beat.
That man -- who is he?
Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
It's true -- I know her.
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
What a shame!
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Were you wicked?
You know that song?
Um, I don't really know this one...
Tell me about it.
Amateurs 2
Babies
Again!
What?
You know?  About me?  About everything?
Sing!
What?  What time is it?
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
Five a.m.?
I... I brought you something.
Right.  Okay.  Bob.  Nice to know you.
A novice.
We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.
Now you.
Right.
Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
You watch yourself!
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
Keep moving!
Mary Clarence!
Experience!
We could have been killed!  But you saved me!  Thank you, Mary Clarence!
Give me a C.  A C!
HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
Oh no.  We'll always be together.
Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is that bus?
They're from my old convent.
Again?
She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
Bless you.
It's true!
What did He say?
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
Enough joking.
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
You were unhappy?
I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
What?
What? 
Your cigarette -- out.
What?
And all those like you.
You mean black people?
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
Mary Clarence?  Like a guy?  Like a dumb guy?
The vow of obedience.
I'm outta here.
Until sundown.
No food.  Not until sundown.
Yes.  Until breakfast.
Your cell.  Your room.
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
Your cell is more than adequate.
Come, Sister.
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
I am?
You're my Olympic event.
Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
You have a phone call.
Good day.
Oh?
You saved my life.
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
Screw you!
Then-you run.
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
No nothing.
With nuns?  With rulers?  No way.  I'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince.
Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch.
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
I am?
I've been worried about you.
No -- worried about you.  Personally.
You're not... seeing anybody?
I know, I know.  I'll be careful.  I'll try.
How?
What?
You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
That's not the point!  They need me!
Even nuns have to pee.
Hail, Mary.
But -- wait.
They open a window.
I wouldn't even tell the Pope.
We didn't tell you what?
I'm telling you!
Take care of it.
It's a bluff, Vince.
Not... totally.
What's the problem?
It didn't work, Vince.
So, take it off.
Which one!
Which one?
Willy -- hit the lights.
Where is she?
She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!
Neither did you!
For like, twelve zillion eternities?
She's praying.
Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.
We can't leave it up to the Feds!
Yes?
Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
Which convent was that, Sister?
He's decent.
He's kind.
It's better than ice cream.
It's better than springtime.
It's brought people back to the church.
It's no use.  She just isn't here.
We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
She wasn't a nun?
And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...
But how do we get there?
Christy.
Impossible.
But... she was a showgirl.  She didn't have an old convent.
But where?
Yes?
We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
I know. 
She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
Can you hold?  Can you try?
Well enough.  Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
Never.  A shoe that size I would have remembered.
Two days... ?  For murder?
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
You must have missed your mark.
To place it inside its coffin.
What is that?
What are you spying on?
A diseased monster.
You need to sleep.
Bring him.
You need rest.
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
What of it?
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Your superiors are two days away!
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
Wallowing in sin and lust...
They need guidance.
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
Hmm?  See them?
May we look at them now?
A fine idea.
Master Hardenbrook...
Well... that might be... helpful.
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
It's not something people speak of openly.  She did not remarry.
Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
I'm sure I don't know.
Up.
The Western Woods.
Look again.
Not for eating, I assure you.  Watch here.
No, I couldn't...
Witches do not exist.  However...
Listen.
I hear nothing.
What happened?
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
Stay back.
Why this tree?
All I saw was their lantern.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
Did your father take a loan?
There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
Lady Van Tassel.
I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
Lady Van Tassel...
I know.  Hold on.
Take the reins.
I doubt that's the end.
Tired.
I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
Small talk.
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
It would be interesting to find out.
I insist that you have it.
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
It was not butchery.
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
But, why?  Tell me why.
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
No, but... why do you ask that?
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
I apologize if I worried you.
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
What did you say?
Just... keep where you are.
Yes.  I did notice that, thank you.
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
Come with me.
I have not been able to face him yet.
If you think I am behind this, say it.
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.
I do not know.  Away.
He moves too fast.
His horse.
Keep climbing.  I will follow...
We have no choice.
Yes, actually.
Use caution.
Where?
Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
It is fine.  Now, I must...
What... ?
Let her go!
I didn't see none.
What did you say?
Turn around.  Now!
In a way, yes.
Sit.
Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
Doctor, he is awake.
May I see my mother?
She is guilty.
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
She has confessed.
No.
Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon my language, ma'am.
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
Yeah, me too.
You got any money?
See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
Well, what did you want?
You have any biscuits for sale?
Naw, we don't have biscuits.
What you got that's good to eat?
Well, I guess it's all good.
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
Yeah.
Give me the big'uns.
What you got in there, warshing?
About a half a mile I think it is.
I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
What?
It went real good.
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?
Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.
Don't rush ever'body, honey.
Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.
That's funny.  You go to bed and take snot nose with you.
I thought I told you to keep out!
What's all them books?
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
You believe in the Bible?
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
Childers.
What are all them books?
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
Don't you live somewhere?
I did live there in the state hospital.
Why'd you live there?
Yeah.
How come?
I reckon I feel all right.
You don't seem like you'd kill nobody.
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
You told me to come by.
Did you want to play ball with us?
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
Who did you kill?
Two people.
Were they bad people?
I thought they was.
Maybe they needed it.
It's okay if you're lookin' out for yourself. If it's self-defense. Was it self-defense?
I like the way you talk.
Where'd you get them flowers?
You want to go with me?
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
All right then.
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
Pull on your works. Your privates.
Oh, jackin' off?
Yeah.
Why?
Yes sir. Right then it was.
A little ol' boy.
I heared it cryin' a little through that box.
Yeah.
It was fun, anyhow.
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
I've got a feelin' today.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
You know I would. Whatever you want.
I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
I know he does.
Mama?
Huh?
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
I reckon.
Yeah.
I ain't got no boy.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
I ain't got no boy.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
You better go get 'em.
All right then.
I want to come back and stay here.
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
Yes sir.
Do they know about you?
My history.
Yeah.
Tolerable, I reckon.
I didn't aim to.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
Well, okay. I got you some.
Yeah.
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
Why are you here now?
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
That boy wants me to.
Did you knock on the door yet?
Naw, I ain't.
Quite a spell, I reckon.
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
No, we have to get this story.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
Why won't he talk to women?
It's my birthday.
Actually, I'm his father.
Better make it charge. 
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
And your father? Is he from New York?
American literature. What else?
That's the subject of my last chapter.
Not an easy book.
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
Huh?
What about for you?
For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
Do me a favor, will you?
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.
Yeah, I did.
It's yours?
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
No, he's not. You are.
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
Not a peep.
It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
Uh, better make it one.
You usually get two.
Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? 
Ready. Any time you are.
Yeah, probably.
Yes, I suppose I do.
I mean, it's a good story.
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
You don't give up, do you?
I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
And what's that supposed to mean?
She looks just like you.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
No, bully for you.
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
Five thousand bucks.
And you're giving it to me?
It's all yours, baby.
For keeps?
For keeps.
Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
And why the hell would you give me money?
So I can get my job back.
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
It'll never be finished.
Huh?
When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open!
Okay, Auggie, I got it. You don't have to yell.
I thought maybe he was pretending.
What can I do for you?
How the hell did you get into the building?
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
You mean Rashid?
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
I figured he had a right to know.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
Paul. Paul Benjamin.
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
Say hi to Paul.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
You shut your mouth! You shut your mouth now!
Well what?
Aren't you going to say anything?
What do you want me to say?
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
Yeah? And why is that?
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
So what's the time?
Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
Rashid. Rashid Cole. 
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
East Seventy-fourth Street.
In Manhattan?
Of course. Where else?
The what?
Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address. 
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
Eight-thirty.
Eight-thirty?
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
Three nights.
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
Take good care of yourself, okay?
I don't know. For helping me out.
Where did you get that thing?
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
You work too hard, you know that?
Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
Is it yours?
Yeah, it might be.
Here, catch.
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
And started to run.
And started to run.
Good thinking.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
No wonder he was angry.
Don't worry about it. You've got friends now, remember? Just behave yourself, and everything will work out.
Good. I'm glad that's settled!
It's all right. I really do know them.
I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
Medium rare, please.
Fries?
Yes, please.
Lettuce and tomato?
Yes, please.
Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
I'm a hemotologist, sir, I was asked only t...
You don't.
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
You done your math right.
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
Happy for him.  And relieved.
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Closer to eight.
And then, something did.  Carl Heine was found dead.  With his head crushed.
But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
You're implying th...
I said.  No further questions.
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael. He'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword.
Why?  We're only talking.
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
I did.  But the jury won't s...
Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
He said, 'Could it be somebody hit him?'  And I said, 'You want to play Sherlock Holmes, here?'
All right.  What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.
Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
I have told the truth.
Since September.  Last guys got transferred.
Three kids.  What's she going to do?
It's public record.  If the public cares enough to read it.
Have a look.  At nothing.
You're right.  I better use two.
Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
You're wondering why I held it.
Yes, he was.
Fell.
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
The knife.  What knife?
He hit his head.  On the way in.
Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.
It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
I was checking the cables.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
Sure you did.  Help me with this hold cover, willya?
Sure.  Blood gets all <u>over</u> your hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.
I think you like learning.
I want you.  To tell the truth.
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
You have to wonder.
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
And her farmhouse...?
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
Sure, anything's poss...
For the third time, yes.
<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
I can't speak for him.
Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore.
That's all he said.
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
Yes.  And that one, too.
Okay, doll.
I suppose you want a tip?
Wanna see my driver's license?
Get lost, will you?
All right, girls.  Who does this belong to?  Come on, now.  Speak up.  Sugar, I warned you!
All right, girls - from the top again.
Thank you ever so.
You're welcome.
It's entirely mutual.
Fresh!
It's private.  Go away.
Manhattans?  This time of night?
What did he say?
Those two musicians from the garage!
Of course I am.
We're not?
Hey, Joe!
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
Look at the bull fiddle - it's dressed warmer than I am.
With you.
With me?
We're not too late, are we?
It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
They got the bull-fiddle.
You don't see any blood?
As far away as possible.
We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
With those legs?  Are you crazy?
And I'm Daphne.
Now you've done it!
Done what?
Tore off one of my chests.
You'd better go fix it.
You better come help me.
Now you tore the other one.
You tore it again!
I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -
Then pull the emergency brake!
Good night, Josephine.
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
Break it up, girls!  Daphne! Come on, help me!
I got pinched in the elevator.
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
And I'm not even pretty.
Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
Don't get burned, Daphne.
Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
Daphne, you're bothering us.
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
And where's he going to be?
He's going to be ashore with you.
That's right.
Oh, no!  Not tonight, Josephine!
You can both go take a flying jump.
Remember - he's your date for tonight. So smile.
Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
Oh, no.  I'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.
I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.
Have I got things to tell you!
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
WHAT?
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
You think he's too old for me?
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time!
Like what?
Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
Like right after the ceremony.
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
What?
Okay, Joe.
Get me Room 414.
What do you think you're doing?
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
Hello, Room 414?  This is the ship-to-shore operator - I have a call for Miss Sugar Cane.
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
There you go with that we again.
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
There's a convention, all right.  There's also the ladies' morgue.
We're not on the pier yet -
Terribly sorry.
I'll say.
See you around, girls.
Good night, honey.
Honey - she called me honey.
Oh, I can think of a million things -
Sssh.  Sweet Sue.
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
Stay as long as you'd like.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
No.  It's nice and cozy.
Anything wrong?
No, no.
And your head is hot.
That's ridiculous.
And you've got cold feet.
Isn't that ridiculous?
I'm a very sick girl.
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
I'm not that sick.
I'm fine.
Half-full.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
When?
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
No fair guessing.
We have some bourbon - lets make Manhattans.
Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
But there's one thing I envy you for.
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
Or was it Bryn Mawr?
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
Oh yes, we do!
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
I met one of them.
Yes.
You like it?
I always did.
That's what I call a louse!  If I were you, Sugar, I'd throw that bracelet right back in his face.
Oh - here and there - and around.
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
Yes.  For a whole year.
I thought you said three years.
What's the big idea?
The Florida job?
You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
- you got to be blonde -
We could dye our hair.
We could -
Help yourself.
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
I am Cinderella the Second.
Let me carry one of the instruments.
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
You must be quite a girl.
Wanna bet?
Goodbye?
Oh, you don't get off that easy.
No, thank you.  I'll walk.
About that roadhouse -
You're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself.
Yes, Osgood?
You're leading again.
Sorry.
Come one!
Flower girl.
And I can never have children.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
Well - nobody's perfect.
To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
You ain't going nowhere.
We won't breathe a word.
You won't breathe nothing' - not even air.
You're making it up pretty good so far.
Because I got some plans -
Yes, Joe.
My car?  Why, you -
Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
It's not the backs that worry me.
What kind of band is this, anyway?
You got to be under twenty-five -
William Morris!
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
Yes, we're the new girls.
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
Oh.
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
I'll say.
You can't trust those guys.
You know - I play tenor sax.
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
I want mine to wear glasses.
Search me.  I mean - I'll see.
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Would you mind terribly?
Not at all.
Good night, Sugar.
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
Seventy-five.  That's three-quarters of a century.  Makes a girl think.
Just my feminine intuition.
She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.
My fault.
I don't think so.
Why?
Who are you?
Now, really -
Not very likely.
Are you staying at the hotel?
Not at all.
Your face is familiar.
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
That's very interesting.
Up, up, up.
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
For your own amusement?
- opening of the Opera -
- riding to hounds -
- and always the same Four Hundred.
It's been delightful meeting you both.
And you will come to hear us tonight?
If it's at all possible -
What?
Guess!
They repealed Prohibition?
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
Yes - that's our hurricane cellar.
It's all right for a bachelor.
What a beautiful fish.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
What is it?
Oh - a member of the herring family.
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
It's the crews' night off.
You mean we're alone on the boat?
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
You mean - like frigid?
Have I?  I'm trying all the time.
Nothing at all?
Complete washout.
That makes me feel just awful.
I don't want to bore you.
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
Is it that hopeless?
Thanks just the same.
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
So inhale!
I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Let's make it an even million.
Did you have a nice time?
Nice?  It was suicidally beautiful.
From a rich millionaire.
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
I told you - I'm not very bright.
I come to the old lady's funeral.
Booze.
Some people got no respect for the dead.
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
We got different information.
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
Toothpick Charlie?  Never heard of him.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
These are my lawyers - all Harvard men.
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
What's his first name?  And where does he live?
That's an opera, you ignoramus.
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
You shave with your spats on?
I sleep with my spats on.
Yes, sir.
I already told you.
Refresh my memory.
Spats Colombo.
Well, we all got to go sometime.
Orders from Little Bonaparte.
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
Except its Scotch.
Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Dont worry about it.
Are you sure youre okay?
Im fine. I promise.
Hey.
Sure, disappear. Weve been walking away our whole lives.
Or Kat....
Jeffrey told her last night.
Last night?
Why, with you.
Oh, dont be that way.
Theres a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
You are taking the piss?
I had to say something to get you here.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
What?
Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
And Kat was fully clothed.
Oh, shut up. Youre an optician.
Lasik surgeon, actually.
And you do now?
Doesnt look like nothing.
Oh, hello.
Crikey.
What?
Nothing, nothing.
No, tell me.
Hello, Katmandu.
I have regrets.
Its called character. God, youre predictable.
Right. Seven.  Christ, thats a long time, isnt it?
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Its no big deal. I promise.
Kat.
You have feet?
Really?  Dont get too attached.
Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in share. People do that.
What does your gut say?
Youre too good for him.
Why?
Im compulsive and weird?
Its cute.
What is?
You stand on your tiptoes.
I do?
I have a friend at the magazine.
Your friend guaranteed my anonymity.
Shampoo, got it!
What?!
What do you think?
Oh, come on. Youre like the Yoda of escorts.
Show me.
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasnt one of them.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
Yeah.
I didnt say he was worth it.
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
So whats with the nickname?
Hi.
What?! No, no. You cant--
I have to.  Im the best man.
Therapist.
You knew?
Im so sorry.
You pawned it.
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
You want me to let him in?
Of course, dont be silly.
Hi, kiddo.
Meet Nick.
Its complicated, Dad.
...but its getting there. 
Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.
I havent thought about that in years.
Is there any other way to take it?
That does it...
That's where we come from first?
That's where we came from first.
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
What he talk 'bout?
It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
What do that mean?
Go on...

Children, come here...
You sure can, son...
No mam -- I looked all over.
Listen, Mama...
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
Good night...
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
Who's Miss Johnson?
Miss Johnson is a teacher, and...
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
It's the heat.
He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.
He can't get up, Mama!
Come in, children.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now...
No, thank you -- I gotta go do some work in the field today.
No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
I'll walk...
I'm used to it.
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
Might be...
At the way you ask funny questions, Josie Mae!
I brought these walnuts to trade.
I wanta get some things.
Tired.
Mornin'...
You ready to eat?
I'll wait till after the children.
Little chilly.
You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?
Yeah, just stay where you is...
I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
Behold my glory.
I am the clitoris.
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
Pillow.
Success!! Our device works perfectly! We will begin mass production immediately!
Eric!
How would you like to gargle rat jiz?
I said -
But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
Chef, do you know anything about women?
Very funny!
I saw him last night!
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
How the fuck should I know!!
Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it probably can't sustain itself over ninety minutes.
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
You bet your fucking ass it was!
Yeah,  <b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!!</b>
Yeah!  And what rim job expert went and outlawed Cheesy Poofs!?
Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
What?
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The password is...
What Cartman?!
Kenny! I saw Kenny again!
WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!!
No way.
No you can't Kenny!
Mph rm rmph!!
Okay.    Not.
What the hell are you guys doing here?
Yes, hon?
I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
Eric, that is not appropriate.
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
Norwegian Ass Raper.
Oh yeah.
Eric?
A hunger strike? For what?
I don't know.
Something big, children.
Hey, Chef.
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
It's... It's not good children.
Oh no, it's that kid.
This is the place--
What?
This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?
Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting!
Doky maping she deeder!!!
Baba mama!
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
Then move out of the way.
Oh, you want out of hell, huh?
Do as I say, Kyle!
We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
What's the password?
Uhh... I don't know.
Uhh... Bacon.
Okay.
FREEZE!!
Yeah, I guess.
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror?
For pooping, silly.
Kay.
Oh... Alright, back you go.
We can't leave without you!
It's okay, I am done for.
We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
She's not my girlfriend, dude!
YOU BASTARD!!
You bastards!!
It isn't fair!
Our moms suck!
How do we do that?
I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
Good thing she was never your girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.
Totally!
Yeah, they suck.
What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
Yeah, so what do we say?
-Or monkey fucker-
Huh?
Yes?
I'm needing lunch.
What the hell is going on?!
Oh.
Oh God... What have I done...
The F word?!
What is Terrance and Phillip?
Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
Then we'll have to resort to plan B and call the v-chip organization.
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
Hello, Brooke Shields!
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
You would know, dummy.
Terrance! NO!
Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
I am.
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
I know.
You don't care.
I mean cute dumb. Now bend over!
No! It can't be!
Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
I don't care!  I want to talk about it now!
That's nice, Stan.
Yup.
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
You don't get it Stan... You just don't get it.
Hi Stan.
What's the matter, Wendy?
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?
Wendy?
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
My friend the clitoris told me.
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
Really? Where the hell do you keep it? It's huge.
You didn't?
<b>Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for</b>
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
And ze rope?
Check.
And the butfor?
He's shutting off the air!!!
Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.
Oh yeah...
Oh Sara...
Anna...
Anna...
They're not going to make it!
It can't be.
Excuse me?
You're Warren Wayne.
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
Koros, as in...Koros?  Dimitri Koros?
Magnificent, magnificent.
Well I appreciate that.
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
So...
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
I did nothing to the monitors.
They are awaiting further information.
The device has stopped responding.
Ain't it the truth. Must be good to be rich.
It's a little late for you to be up.
Well it's a good thing that I did.
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
All right, I'll give it a shot.
Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
It's steady, good benefits.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Thank you.
Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
I can hardly wait.
Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
Taylor, you surprise me.
I know, I know.
Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
Damage control!  What kind of damage? What's going on Barnes!
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Let's get something straight, Chappy!
That's clear.
Over and out!
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
Like that piece of ass he was with.
Don't say that!  It ain't over till it's over!
Will you shut up already?
Just don't move around too much.
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
This is my second commercial flight.  I used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
I don't know.
Well maybe we can do something like that.
Seen one like it before?
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
Close every door behind you!
Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.
Wait.
I understand.
Ready as I'll ever be.
So we did.
At this point I'm ready for anything.
Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
Sure.
Helllp!
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
What?  What are you talking about?
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
Taylor!  Where are you?
Barnes?
I'm about to blow the wall.
Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!
So what's going to happen to you?
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
Sooner than later.
Over and out.
We have room!  Let's go!
What do you mean?  What happened!
We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
And so far.
Marry you?
That's right.  Will you marry me?
I don't know.  Wave to them!
Congratulations on your...recent award.
Thank you.
No, just enjoying the view.
He's in the bathroom.
Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
Homesick?  It's only been two days!
Send it back if you don't want it.
How am I supposed to know?
What makes you so sure?
The engines!
Mac.  What's shaking?
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
That's affirmative.
I'm from Akron.
What kind of man?
A bowler.
Nope.
You have orange whips?
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
It belonged to my dad.
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
What do you want with old man Faz?
Lemme see your ball.
You afraid we're gonna steal it?
When you get a chance.
We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
Are you guys bruddas?
I hate fuckin' opera.
You listen to the feelings, not the words.
No kiddin'.
Wait! That's an aria!
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
See ya 'round Faz.
Theo's bowled on the tour.
Oh, a professional man. What'll you have?
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
Wish me luck.
Theo.
Need some advice, huh.
Don't worry about the Congress, they're just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies.
100 years! 
It's mine.
Who gave it to you?
Grace Skinner.
She's my mom.
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
I ain't nobody's father!
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
What's it look like to you?
You wish!
I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
I'm getting to like it here.
No...
He says that to all his wives.
I am underground.
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
Hello, mom?
I found dad.
Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.
I gotta go. Love ya mom.
Cool!
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
Who's there?
Buzz Fazeli.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
Who's there?
Junior.
Junior who?
Someone wants to play with me?
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?
I like you, Theo. You bowl with soul.
Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
She ran away to be with that...  that Motocross champion.
Leave him alone!
You still got the touch Junior.
Bowling "Center"!
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
Line up where you want it.
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
I'm a bowler.
They suspended me.
He's my father, Millie.
The Peter Pan.
Whips...orange whips.
Uh...over easy.
Coming right up.
Mine, and they never tip.
What do you want with my dad?
Everything has it's drawbacks.
Where did your brother escape from?
The mental hospital.
What does he do?
It's a vicious cycle.
No, not at all.
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
I'd rather you didn't.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Not while I'm in training.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No. Do You?
No. Not at the present.
So, what about you?
Do I want you?
We'll get into that later.
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
Well, that was plan A.
What's plan B?
Plan B is your dad.
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
What's plan C?
Plan C...  ...is me.
Really? I kinda like it.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
More than you could afford.
Come on, bargain with me.
I could let them go for ten.
Why should I help that old fuck.
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.  Too late for what?
Too late for what, Sheila?
Why not?
It's Junior, isn't it.
Tell me what happened Theo.
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
I feel sick.
You should.
Are you sure he's dead?
I didn't stop to take his pulse.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
You don't get two chances with Junior.
At least I'll die smiling.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
Fuck plan C!
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
Suck my dick!
I am a professional man.
Lips still for sale?
I'm not here to bowl.
Tell your little pal to let go.
Breeze, give him his ball back!
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
Who identified the body?
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
Please, Dr. Levine.
Open it, Captain!
Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your seat!
They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
Fletcher, I want you back here.
It's burning...
Get out of there!
I can't see...
Fletcher!  Now!
I can't...
Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
Back away then.
Wait a minute --
I said back away.
Would you wait a minute?
What is it?
How about I just press the button?
Two and a half days?
But she's --
Nobody move!
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
What was that?
What do we use for defense?
But you've tested it?
He's right beneath us.
That's our reserve air.
It's either that or we grow gills.
Do you see it?
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
Now!
Pull it, damn it!
Captain.  Right, forgive me.
The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
Nothing else.
Press?  No, I haven't.
Well, we don't have all the facts yet.
A thousand feet.
Then why am I here?
What?
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
Maybe older --
It's impossible.
ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
What's wrong with oxygen?
Take a look.
What?
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
I don't know.  That's the point.
Everything can be killed.
What do you mean, he's missing?
He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
You don't want to know.
I think I do.
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
-- and then brought her down here --
-- I didn't know it would come to this --
That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
You don't think weapons are important?
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Jerry?
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
Pull it.
Working on it now, sir.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
They're coming.
Nothing, sir.
Fuck him.  What?  Hello?
Well, where the fuck is he?
In the ship, sir.
Sir!  Sir, the door -- it's opening.
If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
Then how can it be chipped?
Yes, Harry.
So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
Ted seems to have some ideas.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
Please watch your closest monitor...
How do you mean, strange?
It's not ignorant.
What -- you want me to retype it?
She wired this system.
Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.
What are you going to do -- shoot her?
What is it?
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
Sir, about leaving --
To what?
Internal power.
Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
What's inside the sphere.
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
The sensors are picking up something outside.
Resetting the sub.
What sub?
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
That's quite a secret.
Because when we get down there --
Wait -- down where?
Underwater?
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
The library.
We have a library?
Yeah, it was awful.
What about you?  What happened to you?
What?
And you didn't tell anyone?
Beth --
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
What could have done this?
What are they?
Eggs.
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
Fuck you, Norman!  It's right here...
In Edmunds' things.
You went through Edmunds' things?
Don't tell me to calm down!
You told him about me?
Don't do this.
You bastard.
Beth --
I have to reset the sub.
Don't bother me, Norman.
It's not worth the risk.
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
Why should I go?
In case you die, too?
I don't trust Harry to do it.
I would.  But my suit --
I fixed your suit.
You don't trust me?
But I don't know how --
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
You can't.  Counter's at 10 minutes. You don't have time.
Still clear.
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
The refridgerator.
We must've had it delivered then.
Wait a second --
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
None of this was here before.
You don't believe me.
What?
What?
I don't know.
How can the sphere do that?
Why would Harry go back to using a code?
Something for burns.
Ephedrine hydrochloride.
Valdomet.
Ulcers.
Sintag.
A synthetic opium analogue.
Tarazine?
Bingo.
Antihistamine.  For bites.
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
Antibiotic.
How do you spell it?
P-a-r-a-s-o...
It's a soporific.
Causes sleep.
Three to six hours.
I'll just boost the doses.
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
How fast does it take effect?
Doesn't say.
You want to kill him?
Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
For what?
Not believing you.
Where are you?
In the sub.  Resetting the timer. Why?
What do you mean, different?
I'm feeling better.
Are you?
You think I'd really drink that?
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
You know what I mean.
Do you fear them?
Don't you?
Are you manifesting them?
He can't manifest.
No, he can't.
C'mon -- what?
You're lying --
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
You manifested that, Beth.
Is it?
But I have to, Norman.
I promise --
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
Beth --
It's either this... or I kill you.
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
Don't you know?
Leave me alone, Norman.
I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
Top shelf, is it?
You hear that?
Hear what?
Get away from me!
Beth --
Get away --
Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
It doesn't make any sense.
Who says it's a he?
For whoever's in that thing.
It's an American spacecraft.
Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood right there --
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
In time for what?
What?
Just in time for what?
Like what?  I'm not --
You're staring at me.
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
Won't make any difference.  The tapes document everything.
What?
You holding up alright?
Fine.  I'm fine.
Don't be defensive.
I'm not being defensive.
You sound defensive.
No, why don't --
Wait a second, I --
Look, would you --
Whatever I can do to help.
To what?
Time travel.  A black hole.
Which one?  Let me get the list out.
Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
Gimme another explanation.
No.  I didn't say that.
Then what, Norman?
What noise?
It's like...
What are you still doing here?
You remember opening the door?
Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
Then explain it to me.
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
You don't remember that?
Norman, where are you?
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
You're clear.  You see the airlock?
What do you mean?  She's not here?
When I woke up, nobody was here.
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
Beth left?
I thought she was with you.
You didn't say that about the food?
Wisconsin?
How do we decode it?
Don't have to.  Watch.  It'll do it for you.
You know what it is, Harry.
Stop what?  What are you -- ?
I don't think so.
Shut up and open the door.
Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
Hold on.
I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
I heard!  I heard!
Shut up and catch.
I'm trying to keep balance with --
Gimme a second --
You got her?
Well, press something!
Wait!
Nine hundred feet to surface.
We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
What is it, Harry?
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
That's right.
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
Is it?
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
If it is an alien spacecraft --
Please.  It must have flown here --
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
Arrived?  From where?
"We are friends".
Thank you.
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
The others, sir?
Beth and Harry?
Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.
This way, sir.
Huh?
What report?
You mean you don't know?
Know what?
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Geologists?  At a plane crash?
What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
He's a pussy.
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
Still, make a note I recognized that.
Squint harder.
Please, Ted.
Try this one.
This is like nursery school.
Unless it's an act.
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
You seen my suitcase?
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus?
Was it a military crash?
I don't know.
I'm beginning not to like you.
May the Force be with you.
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
Of course.  I'm a Bendu officer.
I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
You saw through me?
You could put it that way.
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
They use the Bogan Force.
These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
He can't find Organa Major.
Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
You look great!  The uniform and everything!
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
Just be warned, that things aren't always as they seem... especially the starforce recruiting posters.
Yes, sir.
Have you been checked out?
I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.
What's that?
Forget it, son.
I'll make a report later.
Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear.
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
I'd better go see how he's doing.
I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
It's automatic.
What are you saying?
I don't know... I've never fought anyone.
Why didn't you say so before.
I think I did.
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
Not if this tunnel deadends.
Come back here... Where are you going?
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
Well, if it's not, we'll be facing that Death Star all by our lonesome.
Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
No need, everything's under control.
With four casualties?!
You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
He'll be well cared for.
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
Well, ask him.  Tell him we need five thousand.
I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
I read you sir.
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
Something... I've got...you don't.
You rich kids... are all the same !
It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
YAAAAAAAA !
Death to all bugs !
He was our teacher... He was great.
Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.
Not enough, I guess.
We're the old men, Ace.
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
Sir... I guess I do, sir.
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
Others are waiting.
You got it bad.
Ace of spades.
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
I got Games & Theory.
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.
I'm getting better.
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
Don't you have to finish the game ?
They revoke our flight status.
Oh, I see... teamwork.
Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
Well, whad'ya know...
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
It looks like an... asteroid.
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
Excuse me...!
You're upset, that's alright.
A funeral.
I don't know, Zander.
I do.
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
Your turn...
Who ?
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
It's all I think about anymore.
Johnny, my Dad's home today.
How do I know if this is love ?
It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.
I'll meet you outside.
Good luck at the academy.
What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
You two have so much in common.
He's nothing like you.
I don't even know if you're my girl.
Who cares ?
You're right. Let's never stop...
Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
Did you get Starside R&D ?
Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
I love you.
You don't look very happy to see me.
That was just a mix up.
I like it. It's kinda...you.
See you on the bounce !
We've gotta go get her !
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am.
No way, ma'am !
Number 4, contact Fleet and tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way.
That's it, we're empty ma'am !
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
Too bad for her if she's not around.
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
You're the best.
No thanks, Diz.
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
Flip six, three hole.
What ?
You got it.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
I'm gonna need a squad leader.
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
Well, excuse me, sir...
What ?
All bands.
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
It's alright 'cause I got to have you, Johnny...
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
Looks like rain.
This time of the year...?
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
Oh, is that how it is ?
Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
Good luck. It's not there anymore.
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Doesn't look like it to me.
No, sir.
I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
Hi, mom.
I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
You can never be sure.
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers.
The Rodger Young just burned up...
I'm gonna save Carmen.
Move out.
Been better, buddy.
What is your position ?
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
What is it, Rico ?
Kill the bitch.
Yes, sir.
Who's that with you ?
V'ger is that which programmed me.
Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?
V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
Who is V'ger?
V'ger is that which seeks the Creator.
You may proceede.
The Creator has not answered.
The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
The information will not be disclosed.
V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
<U>Answer</U>!
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
Departure angle.
Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
May I ask Why?
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
You are, Mister Decker. I'm afraid you'll have to double as Science Officer.
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
Stop competing with me, Decker!
Permission to speak freely, sir?
Granted.
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
It's taken control of the computer...!
It's running our records! Starfleet strength, Earth defenses...
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.
That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
A tractor beam...
   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
Decker....!
Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
Our Exec and Science Officer...
Twelve seconds...!
Impact in fifteen seconds...
Ten seconds....
Opinion, Mister. Spock?
Viewer, standard ahead.
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Hold station.
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
Aye, sir.
We're already two settings below that, sir.
Hold relative position here...
Viewer ahead, sir.
Thrusters at station keeping...
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
See that it is.  Take me over, please.
Sit down, please.
I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
Mr. Decker... ?
Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
Ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.
New crystals: they must contain the most recent data obtained --
A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
We're ready, sir.
Thank you, Scotty. Stand by.
Helm ready, sir.
Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
<U>Urgent</U> signal from Starfleet, Captain!  <U>All</U> Earth defense systems have gone dead.
Tractor beam remains constant...
Annie...got an umbrella...?
Nope.
I'll be there.
You bringing your new friend?
Sure plan to.
He have any special dietary requirements...?
He'll eat potroast and like it.
Go you Huskies?
You bet your life.
I need a typewritter.
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
I have one, but they lost it.
The people in New Hampshire.
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
What's it called?
"Anguish."
You quit.
Why did you quit?
Why?
It's about life.
N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
That's true.  You grow up here?
Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou Theatre.
But, but but but...
No, no, I see...
That: in an act of...
Yes...
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
I understand...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
As the Old Mill goes around...
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
Surest thing you know.
That's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...
Mmm.
...that.
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
I love your script.
How can you <u>say</u> that?
<u>Yes</u>...
About <u>conflict</u>...
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
I...
Me?
Yes.
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
Cast stood me up.
Uh huh.
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
...lost the screw...
You got a paperclip?
Never saw the point of 'em.
Fix my glasses.
Better idea...
"Room Service!"
Would you go in...
You have to sign for it.
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
I don't drink.
It's for your finger.
Read the card.
Oh.
Then I'll come back, then.
No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow.
Because I'd met someone else.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
You believe that?
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
I used to go out with a politician.
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
Why?
Go you Huskies!
I can't get it to come out right.
It used to be the Old Mill.
What've you got?
I hurt you?
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
...yes.
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
...take <u>any</u> two people...
Hi.
Where you going?
Going home.
No, that's true.
Gosh, you look nice.
...what...?
Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper.  Show you the plans...
It does?
Did as of last week.
You'd do the newspaper right here.
That's something a man could do...?
You know what else a man can do?
Sleep well?
Oh yeah.
...and we could get up every morning...
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
Well ain't you amazing.
I saw...
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
Carla was in the car, right?
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
...you think that's right...
I'm going to tell the truth.
I'll knit you a sweater.
Morning.
Waal, that's what I'm saying.
After Drama Group.
Drama Group?
That's right...
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
Yes, that's right.
That's so beautiful...
I beg your pardon?
We had a date.
We did...?
I've been thinking.
No.  Don't tell me that.
I'm sorry.
Why, you <u>whore</u>!
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
Well, then, what's he doing here?
What're you doing here...?
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
Courthouse back in town.
Town ain't got no courthouse.
What?
Hold court, they have to, science lab, the high school.
Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire?
They know what her tits look like.
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
...why am I here...?
Now: I'm looking at the...
Fifteen hands.
Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
They think it's your First Wife...
That Could Be.
She wasn't in the...
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
What'll I do for fun?
Whyn't you learn your lines?
I <u>know</u> my lines...
Nothing happened.
No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
I loved it...he...
It's...
Sister, I've just come from a <u>fire</u>...
I don't eat vegetables.
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
Sure, what have you got?
What do you drink?
How old are you?

I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.
I...
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Tell it with...
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
We've got three days to...
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
What...
What I...
You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."
No, you're absolutely r...
Everybody needs a hobby.  Okay, look Page...
Everybody needs a hob...
Joe, the writer?
Just him and me.
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
Could I see it please...?
If there's anything I...
Scene <u>twelve</u>...arrival at the mill.
There's other things to be learned.
Izzat so?
The Mayor's outside.
What's his name?
Mr. Bailey.
Who is it raped you?
Nobody.
Well, what's the beef?
Then what is the...?
We know that you weren't.
Get him on the...
Cool it, Babe, you started this...
I, actually yes.
I love Jewish men.
Why?
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
I like you, too.
But not that <u>way</u>...
But we...
Look, look there's someone else...
Who is that...?
Oh.
Will you help me out...?
I just...
Claire, Bob Bar...
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
No, no...Please.
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
I can't do it, Walt.
You can't do what?
Is...Is the Movie!
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
Now, look.  Claire:  Listen to me.  I want to tell you a story.
Who are these from?
No, she didn't Claire.  But I think you should do the scene.
I know, I know.
...wants a piece...
Yes.
And you know what...?
We, we have to give it.
...and my heart goes out to you, because I know...
What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
An artist of your caliber...
I'm only trying to...
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
...yes...
...she has a <u>home</u>...
Bob are you alright...?
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
Put something in his room.  What does he like?
Yes.
Did she throw up?
That isn't very nice.
Why not?
She won't stop crying...
Well.
Who got their heads cut?
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
You said <u>three</u>...?
<u>Did</u> I?  I think you're mistaken.
I, uh...I'm leaving.
Why?
Mornin, Chessy...how's the back...?
Doug, the traffic light...
Doug, this is Mr...
What is the...?
Arrest him.
This young woman.
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
He didn't have to tell...
I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
Later for you, pal.
Okay...
Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
My wife's going to have a baby.
Mmmm.  You have children?
No.  No, but we're planning to.
My wife just went into labor...
Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
I had a witness I would.
A witness to what...?
What?
The writer.
He saw the accident...?
Sure.
You bet he did.
Wait a sec, Marty.  Call us back.  Two minutes.
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
Oh, that's <u>great</u>.  Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
I can only write on a manual.
I know the feeling.
That's a real <u>fault</u>, I...
I grew up on your mov...
I know you do.
Where have you been...?
Why?
I know you are.  Go you Huskies.
You want me to lie.
I don't getcha.
The girl was in the car.
I treated you like a son or nephew.
It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
No, what is it?
I have to tell the truth.
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
Then you're finished in show business.
I can write it.  I can't type it.
I didn't say anything to them.
How do you know you saw it?
I don't know.
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
You didn't see it...
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
You were there.  At...at 10:35...?
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
I left that for you.
That's thoughtful.  Ziz good, you try this?
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
Did you bring Bob's weights?
They're coming Fedex...
What's in all the bags?
That's what I said.
I don't got the money.
No no no no no no no no no find me the money...
We don't have the money.
<u>Find</u> it.
If you do the product placement...
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
Is that one hell of a kid?
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
We got to do something nice for <u>him</u>.
There's no witnesses...
No, just the...there's no witnesses, right...?
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
I want them thrown in jail.
Sherry, Sherry...
Why would they be illegal?
That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...
Yes, I hear it.
It takes all kinds.
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
Waal, what was the per-screen average...?
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.
Zat true?
Givvem a cigarette...
...we can't lose the wind...
Wally, I got to takes out that window from the dog.  I can't shoot through...
I don't care.  <u>Fix</u> it.
I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.
I killed her!
She's <u>dying</u> and <u>Rache</u> is your mother now!
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
It happens.
During sex.
I live.  In the same country.
Because it feels really incredibly good.
I like talking about it.  At least, to you.
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
I'll be there for you.
Well.  It's for you.
She knows every neat junk food place.
Secret's safe with me.
THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
...I'm not deaf, y'know.
Not with my mouth open.
Oh, yeh.
Mom?  What's wrong?
Nothing sweetheart.
Don't. Take me with you.
Good.  That's very good.
He's badgering a witness.  Eat.
Don't touch me!  I'm <u>allergic</u> to you!
This is my house too!
And this is my room so get out!
Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
No.  I think it's ugly.
Not use my words, please!
No, baby.  You're gonna use <u>my</u> words.
That's my girl...
There you are!
Don't take my picture!
Annabelle put down that camera.
You owe me a quarter.
YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS!  WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?
There's worse things.
Cos she loves you.
Fine!  Eat in the cupboard.
Then have a donut --
Alright starve.
Annabelle let's get something clear.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
Mmmm!  Tasty.  You're a master chef Ben. Just like your dad.
How could I be?  We learned some magic...
Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
I knew where I was all the time.
Yes...if you like big hair...
What honey?
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
Mom...?
Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.
Pray.  We never find out.
You have the WORST flu since...
I have cancer.  Do you know what that is?
I'm still sick, but I'm better.
Where Ben?
Before you.
How do you know?
Rache says it's from you.
Half.  Of him.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
Every day.  More and more.
At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
Duncan.  I've got an <u>even</u> <u>better</u> idea...
Remarried.  There is no move.
I'm here.
Because you don't really seem here.
You think I didn't get that?
We're not discussing your age.
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
Me too.
Good...Well...Take care.
Don't do this.
And I'm supposed to care.
WE are over.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
And we all went through that together?
Yet another spaghetti night.
Walk in the park.  And thanks for the 'we'.
I live or I die.
We don't have any coffee.
Annabelle, how's your video rep...
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
But it's not on the schedule!
Look, I...
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
I did it for her.
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
Jackie?
Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
But I came here to...
Luke.  Can't live like that.
Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups?
How the hell would you know?
I don't, but...
See, I know that.
Ironic, huh?
Beats me.  Ask your mom.
It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
Yeh, that's bull.  I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.
I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'
And you said...
What else?  Keep on keepin' on.
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
...go to the park.  In the worst way.
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
Feeling the pressure?
He won't discuss it.  Just calls it history.
And I'm going to win.
Don't be too sure.
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
Neutral ground.  What's up?
Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
I lost him.  I was panicked.
Uh.  You hate my guts?
What do I have that you don't?
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
You're the hip and fresh.
You ride with Annabelle...
You'll learn.
Yeh, it's cheaper.
We have the kids this weekend, so...
You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
Can't handle them myself is what you mean.  Can't.
I trust you of course I do but --
They don't hate you --
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
Our weekend.  At that sweet little B &amp; B.
I think so...What do you think?
I think so too...
Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
Are you hungry?  You could make us something?
I know that.
Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.
Imagine my relief.  So what's for dinner?
What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.
Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
By way of saying you were unhappy.
I'm gonna get me a drink.
Does Jackie know this?
No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.
Don't ever say that.
What if he is?
He isn't.
What?
Hey. What's up?
Like what?
You know...Stanley...
Oh.
Thanks, Scoob.
He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
Thank you.
Great to be here.
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Yes, Mikey?
Really? How many?
Four brothers and five sisters.
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
We had to work. My family was poor.
Must've been hard being poor.
I'm still poor.
Speak English.
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
My baby.
You have a bay?
My grandchild-baby.
Oh. How did it happen?
But still, you can't be sure.
I am sure.
But really, you never know.
I know!
For rape and murder.
Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
Yes, I do. I love them!
I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.
Yes, Mikey?
Got a lot of homework?
Is everything OK?
I dunno.
How was the class?
Ready for tomorrow?
What's tomorrow?
You mean, again?
Well, I changed the ending a little.
Oh. What happens now?
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
Your story was terrible!
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
Oh, well, I don't have them yet, but 
I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
The same.
The same. Same as what?
Just the same.
Man, it's just, like, conversation.
Yeah?
We have to talk.
Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
Maybe he's that one in a million!
OK. Stay there. I'll be right back.
Hi, Dad!
Come here, give me a hug!
Gee, you're home early!
What are you doing here?
Uh huh.
Can I join you?
Thank you for being honest.
Thanks.
Say, 'Nigger.'
'Fuck me hard!'
Fuck me hard!
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Again!
Again!!
NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!...
I dunno. See if I have any connections.
Hello, is this Pam?
Who is this?
Toby Oxman.
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Oh, fine. How are you?
Great!
Great!
So what's going on?
That's what I was gonna ask you.
But...you called.
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
Oh, I don't remember that...
I do.
Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
Huh. Kids?
Yeah.
How many?
Three.
Great. How old are they?
OK. Bye.
Thanks.
How'd you get it?
I know.
Is it loaded?
No, I don't think so...
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
Yeah?
You know...I like you.
Yeah. I know.
I mean...
No, thanks.
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Can I see what you have so far?
Yeah. He went to Harward.
Oh.
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Times up!
There isn't anyone! He's opened that whole sector now!
Why? Are we going dancing?
If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
Who's got matches?
We're outta here--
We don't have time!
Yeah and we don't have much ammo either!
What happened!
What do you think?
Yeah?...
There's the fence...
Even better.
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
Where does it lead?
I don't know.  If you gave me a reason to...
I don't want any...
The transmission is an hour old...
He's in there...
I'll let the senator tell you.
What do you mean?
Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There are a number of volatile compounds-- but they are safely stored away...
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
Excellent...excellent!
I say we head out.
Agreed--let's move it.
Captain it would be impossible to turn down such a gracious request.
We can't--it's power driven!
Get your men to do it!
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
There's enough in one vial...
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Possibly some coffee?
Moffo!
I have your word, Mister President?
At his office in the Capitol.
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.
How dare you talk to me in this manner?
I know nothing of the sort!
Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?
Give that back to me.
You mean you'll tell us his name???
That's right, fella.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
Who the hell do you think you are, sir???
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
What did you say?
General Schmuck?
What kind of trouble?
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
Yes, sir.
Do you recognize my voice?
Certainly, General.  Why do you ask, sir?
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
No, sir.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?
You're damned right they are.
Just a squirt.
To peace on earth.
No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
I don't think so, sir.
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
Yes, sir.  But so do we.
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
Do you think they would cheat?
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
Peace on earth.
I presume the planes are armed?
What the hell is Plan-R?
I want to talk to General Ripper.
But we can't communicate with the base.
They're coming in now.
General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
He says they've only shot down three planes.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Look, he's there, and you're here.
No, they wouldn't send us in with bombs on an exercise.
Roughly, one-zero-five. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong.
Roger. One-three-eight.
Lothar, take your checks now.
I don't think so.
Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
Can't help it.  What's the wind like?
Maybe it's an exercise.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the
Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
What?
War.
War?
Forget it, Quentin.  It can happen to the best of us.  Now let's get squared away.
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Call them every five miles.
Maximum ECM!
Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
They must have made a visual contact.
They can't touch us at this height.
They're moving apart.
Hang on, boys.
Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
Primary arming switch.
Where'd they get you?
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Some kind of signaling.
No kidding.
Hellnno, Major.  I was just trying to think the thing through.
As soon as I've checked over the route. About five minutes.  All right?
Primary trigger switch.
First safety.
Seond safety.
Check, ten thousand air burst.
Everything still checks out okay.
Binky?
He's dead.
What happened?
In the back...feels like an arrowhead.
Hell, he looks dead.
Listen, give me a shot quick!
Recall what mistake?
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
Wait a minute, Major.  "OPE," that's the recall code.  Where would they get that?
How the hell do I know?  Maybe the war's over.
Then that settles it, doesn't it?
The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
Right.  So how could we get any messages?
I don't get you, King.
I said that's the point!
Then get off my back!
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
I'm okay.  What's up?
But I get a red light.
Have you tried the emergency system?
Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
Can I have some?
Knock yourself out.
Sure, all the time, in Group.
In Group?
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
Was it okay?
Yeah!
What did you guys think?
Slides go with it.
Yes.
Typical male.
Typical male.
No I quit.
Hey, you said you did a video?
What's it about?
It's really not about anything.
Oh. Well, what's it on?
A cloud.
A cloud?
Yeah.
Do you wanna go to the van?
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
Needs some pizza in his diet.
No, I'm here. Where are you?
Where are you-hoo?
What?
Yeah.
Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.
No, no.
Jesus Christ.
No, he's not with a girl.
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
Watch out for that tree.
Okay, okay.
A long, long, long...
Okay.
So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.
So you can do an album cover?
No, no, I wasn't trying.
No. Life is too short.
No, I'm not worried.
Good.
No, I mean, no one.
Hey, you know me.
Uh, last night...
Oh, and guess who showed up.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
You know?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
No. It didn't, Buff.
Wait. Hey, man.
Erica is in the van back there.
Look.
Hey, man.
She's in the van.
What she doin' in the van, man?
What?
She's dead.
She's dead?
No, no, no.
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Yeah, man.
It's bullshit. Look! Look!
Jeff! Let's go!
Yeah, right, publicist.
Come on.
Really?
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Sure I am. It's fun.
Mm. And your like, what else?
Well, that's one way of putting it.
Am I fucking him?
Shit.
In what way?
Mm, in a horizontal and wet way!
Buff is funny. God.
Alright, Pony!
I'm so burnt-out.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
You better! Yes!
I will.
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Yo! Your spitting rice all over us! God.
This is private property, my friend.
That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
No, you don't belong here. We were here before you.
It's okay.
Glad it's okay.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
Yeah it's okay. You know, we have a saying back home: "Either the salt is rotten or the meat."
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Oh, you were there?
No, but I heard it was great.
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
Oh, So what about her?
No, no, whoa!
You could do it.
I could.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Yeah!
A reel?
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Wait, I'll get you some air.
Oh, man. Wow. I was never into football, you know?
I'll be in the car, okay?
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
Come on. Inside.
Okay. We'll go for a ride.
Hi.
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
No, not really. Middle-class.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
Maybe upper-middle-class.
He is?
Yes.
He is.
He is.
A Porsche.
Yeah. So, what about you?
Oh, yeah?
Mm-mm.
Erica.
It's a mistake to think that.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
It's nice to do a lot of things.
That's what I mean.
I'm not a nice guy.
I know. It's okay.
Yeah?
Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
We were?
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
Pony and I are friends.
Thank you.
Two-fifty? They go up?
He's drunk.
Uh-huh.
Nobody. Sooze.
Wow, that must be pretty nice there.
Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man.
Ask your girlfriend.
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
That chick, Erica?
Well, w-what happened?
I hit her.
Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
Oh, shit.
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
You don't know?
No.
This is my home.
Just put it down.
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
Is that Bee-Bee?
Come on!
Seven-twenty.
I gave it to you.
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
That's right.
Nazeer Chaudry!
You could've come over.
I hate that.
Yes.
Your sure as hell right about that.
So you can give me more shit?
About what?
Name one.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
One!
Your completely missing the point.
Hey!
I'm talking about idealism.
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
Yes, I stand for -
What? What do you stand for?
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
You know, all you know is what's good for you.
Typical male.
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
Tim!
Yeah.
I would've stopped it.
How?
Us.
Of course.
And?
Come with me.
No one does nothing, Jeff.
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
Mm-hm.
Yes, you do.
No, I don't.
No, I don't.
No. No, no, no.
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
I, yeah.
Mm.
No, no, I have to talk to you.
Is that a threat?
For a ride.
Wait, away?
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
Shit, Jeff!
Wait. What, what are you saying?
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
You're unbelievable.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Oh, fuck it, man!
Go.
What?
Just go.
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Good, man.
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Yeah, good.
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
So how's college?
What?
Yeah, they could be songs.
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Yeah, really.
Now?
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe later.  Hey! Hey!
For a while.
What do you mean?
You know what I'm saying?
Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
I don't know.
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do.
What are you saying?
No, this has everything to do with you.
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
Hey!
Is that your driver?
It's stupid.
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
Look at you!
Oh!
So? What's L.A. like?
It's pretty exciting.
Yeah?
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
You do not want me to do your cover.
I'm always serious.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Would I get paid?
Yeah.
Oh, no, man. I can't.
Alright!
You done?
I can't believe you're still here.
I'm moving.
If...
No, I'm going.
Mm-hm.
Yep.
I don't know. I say what I mean.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
That's because I am.
You do?
Oh, my god!
Really? What else does your mother say?
I think I gotta go.
Nobody's fucking anybody!
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
About what?
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
Yeah.
What are you going to do? Hm?
Yeah?
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
Yeah.
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
So where are you?
I'm here.
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Fucking drunk, huh?
Come on, Jeff.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
The fuck not?
You know the fuck not.
Fuck.
Don't swear it's impolite.
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
You just became a statistic!
Cleo!
It's twins!!
Wayne Gretzky.
Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
Bye.
No...I've been pregnant.
Positive.
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
Of course - of course!  Hands in...
Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that's it?  Hee-hee hee...
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
I sure do.
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
I know, but that was before.
Oh... What are you working on?
Jus some girlie things for the squad.
We're here for you, Diane.
He is the Great One...
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
You sure I'm not fat?
We were told you could "fix us up."
He Ikea'd us.
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
Yeah, hold on.
Kim-Lo?
Wrong number  Nooooooo!
Bullets.
Kansas?
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate.  Where's my smokes?
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
Hold up, hold up.  Any sentence that starts with "at church camp" ain't leading to the big "O."
But you're not married.
Uh...maybe?
Bank branch!
All of you!
I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
Your help.
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
Before you?  Whoo-hoo!
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...
Action! The scene starts.
Let it ride for a while.
You're going to stay, aren't you?
That was the general idea.
Come on.
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
It's from hunger.
Nothing for Ladd?
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
So you take Plot 27-A, make it glossy, make it slick --
About that luggage.  Where's the phone?
Thanks.
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
Thank you.
How about the Rainbow Room?
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
With a wildly beating heart.
Life can be beautiful!
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
Into what? A lampshade?
I tell you this is half sold.
As a matter of fact.  I've given up writing altogether.
You sure have.
So long.
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
Nobody can be that busy.
You're tough, all right.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
Who's who?
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
Saddest thing I ever heard.
Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
It must be my new shampoo.
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
I just don't.
From Artie.  What's wrong?
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
You did.
You bet.
Whose house is it?
Whose?
Nobody asked you to.
Hello, Mr. deMille.
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
It's a good script, isn't it?
I knew there was something wrong with them.
Get out!
Yeah?
You're a writer, you said.
Why?
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
Who else ?
This is fascinating.
Of course it is.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
December twenty-first.
I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
Where do you live?
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
You can stay here.
I'll come early tomorrow.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
Just a scene I cut out.
What scene?
They've come for my car.
I need some money right now.
I've lost my car.
What's wrong with It?
Why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you to look nice, my stray little boy.
I don't need a tuxedo.
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
Come on!
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
Just follow me.
It's those feathers.  They tickle.
The other guests?
"Mad about the boy."
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again!
This is the right day.
They're awful.  They make me cough.
I ran into some people I knew.
Where are my cigarettes?
Where are your...?
I think I'll read a little.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
Why do you say that?
No you didn't.  You took the car.
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
You think I made that up about the gun...
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
No, they don't.
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
Wipe your feet!
Madame is waiting.
For me?  Okay.
It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
Is that so!
Who said you could?  Who asked you to?
That's what I told them.
Good.
There are no locks anywhere in this house.
The doctor suggested it.
What doctor?
You send them.  Is that it, Max?
I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
She is upstairs.
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
What car?
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
Along is no good.  I need it now.
Haven't got a thing.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
You know better than to interrupt me.
Paramount is calling.
Who?
Paramount studios.
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
The cameras have arrived, Madame.
This is the staircase of the palace.
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.
He will be. In about five minutes.
No, a super girl.
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
Whatever you say.
Yes. Whatever I say.  From now on.
Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
Western Europe.
It's a warning, that's for sure.
Maybe it was just an accident.
It's for your own protection.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
I have to.
When can I see, you again ?
Who didn't?
I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
Yes. It reminds me of home.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
Let's talk about us, not her.
Tell me where I can find her.
Why not ?
We're from different worlds.
You don't like me? You hate me?
What do you feel about me?
Let me kiss you.
No.
You're not afraid are you?
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
Just like that?
But why?
I sort of like what you said.
That makes it worse.
But I don't understand.
I'm not mad at you.
It seemed that way to me.
I don't see why not.
But what if---it wasn't real?
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
What?
How do I fight it?
Turn it against her.
Do you want to come to Argo City?
Hmmm?
Well thanks a pile, fella.
Well, there's several ways to go .
Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
A passionfruit smoothee.
Well, just one.
What an adorable hat.
They think I have a concussion.
And you think you're in love.
I know it.
Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
Come back to my house. My car's outside.
I could force you.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
I've got things to do.
What about my proposal?
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
I knew it ! He's working on a  hot scoop !
Oh, no thanks.
The scoop of the year!
I can't help it if men notice me.
Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
I heard stories.  I don't think you wanna know.
Why didn't you tell me?
As brave as my father. As wise.
It's going to be a tree, I think.
Can you create life?
This is all your clothes?
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
She's a beast.
Must've been a defective puck.
It was just a trim.
You sure?
I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
Somebody's gotta do something!!
Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
I'm Linda Lee.
No, MR. Danvers.
Sure. Mate in five moves.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber.
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
I have to talk to you.
You're wasting your breath.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
Cheap but effective.
It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
Criminals.
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
No, that's not true---there's well...no--
I knew it!
Why?
Better than when I was a child.
Don't stop. Keep moving.
Yes, mustn't stop.
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Not enough vodka in it.
There's no vodka in it.
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
What? What did you tell me?
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!
A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
Too much mayonnaise?
Oh...I came close once.
I mean him.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
No, thanks.
Old ties are hard to cut.
Uh-huh.
Well, aren't you excited?
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
Oh. You're going away.
Kent!
What!
We get together sometimes.
Exactly what I was about to ask about me.
At one o'clock in the morning?
Gus Gorman.
What kind?
Dishwasher? Any luck?
Nope, but --
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
First paycheck?
They're just . . . floating around out there. The computer knows where.
One.  And a half.
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
Say what?
The boss wants to see you.
Say who?
Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
I don't think you understand.
Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
Columbia.
Columbia.
That what they call you?
Turn on the T.V.
I did. isn't it neat-o?
Uh...what channel were you watching?
What are you talking about, fella?
God, that's what I keep you for.
Greed!  Let me tell you something---
Huh?
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
Is this whitemail?
What do you want?
A computer.
We've already got some.
Everything.
What will it get me?
Tell me more...
I told you it wasn't no jive.
Exactly. Stoned mother.
Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
No, we're just going down.
We gonna crash?
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
What she call you?
That's his sister. Vera Webster.
What about you?
Anytime.
We've already met.
I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.
Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
But the bridge...
I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
Tell me.
But the other night...
Hey, I know a lot of things!
So I understand from the graffiti I've seen.
Where's the light switch?
Where do you usually find a light switch?
He can have mine. Anytime.
But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
53!
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
Missing????
Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.
Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
Storms! Floods!
Blizzards! Heat waves!
Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
TOMORROW THE OIL!
We already have a super-tanker.
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
We can get to work on that oil!
Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Who needs Gus?
Don't bet on it!
Yeah. I'll check.
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
She'll be fine.
Then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
Do I detect a note of jealousy?
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
Be my guest.
In July???
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.
That's because you can hardly see through those things.
Lois, you're amazing.
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
Lois, I . . .
I was right. you are Superman.
Oh come on, that's ridic -
I didn't think I wanted to.
I'm listening.
Let's go to my place.
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
Let's get you inside . . . .
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
I know that, Lois. And I wish he were here . . .
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
I have to try, dammit! Something, anything . . .
He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
Oh, hi.
Never closed my eyes.
Everything on it.
Does she know about it? She's in it!
What else is ballast for?
You'll have to pack quickly.
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
Good. My heart can't take it.
Your heart, Miss Teschmacher? I never knew you had one.
Is this a philosophy seminar? No. This is getaway.
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
It's beautiful.
It's beautiful.
Wrong.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
I think he said a "curl."
What's a curl?
He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?
 DELETE IN CUTTING
North.
Why?
To ski?
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.

Constantly.
Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home.  Until now.
Dinner. Oh yes.  I'm sorry, I just never do much about that.  But tonight -- I mean, anything you want, Lois.
Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
Cuba.
Put down Lex Luthor?
I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
Yes, but will you honor it?
Free!
And I will lead.
What shall we do now?
Stay. I will come to you.
And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
We must combine our strength.
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
Oh, Clark, you're so delightfully primitive.
Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
Don't worry, I've got you.
If you say so. Here goes.
Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.
Clark. . . !
No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
N-no...I mean...you bet.
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
Yes, darling?
Stuff it.
An angle?
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
Something . . . wonderful.
Our other dinner guest.
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
I must have miscalculated. How. . .
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
You're just an experiment, freako!
Hmm . . . Nuclear levitation. Now that's a trick that could come in handy.
This wasn't in the plan.
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
You are . . . nothing. I am father now.
I made you, and I can destroy you.
Wait! Not yet! Back!
I am master now.
No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
Thank you.
A hot story, huh?
It was hot, yes.
What's she doing in California?
I know.
I know son, I know...
North. It's north
I will.
Well!
No.
Not...gray.
Not really, no.
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
But otherwise it's swell.
What the  --  !
He may have a gun!
Oh, for God's sake!
I just took a shot at it.
Huh?
Big night coming up?
Not unless you can fly.
Come again?
Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -
It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
Jealous? Of what?
Of this...Superman.
Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
Is that what they're calling him?
Besides that.
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
Okay.  Take me to your leader.
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
Even that would be an improvement.
First the pets, Otis.
He's from another world.
You're on.
I didn't say a word.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
When it gets to seventy-five below, stabilize it.
Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.
La de da da...
Ready.
You?! How about me?
You have two minutes and thirty- two seconds.
There was a recipe on the back  --
Something you can feed the pets, perhaps?  Let's have it.
Baby -- I'm going to take you higher.
Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
What are you going to do to him?
He always shows up when somebody's in danger.
I'm wearing it.
I mean the other one!
What other one?
Of course I can. I love you.
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
But so is Vond-El
If you persist, you leave us no choice.
Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
He sure as heck does that.
I bless the day you came to us, son. You know that. But some people wouldn't understand.
Lara, please...
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
Well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
I guess I got carried away
No! You couldn't imagine -
How good it felt!
How good it felt -
Okay, but...why?  No offense.
You've got me? Who's got you???
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
Not while I'm around you're not. C'mon...
Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
Right on the first guess.
Wha'...what are you doing here?
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
I guess they are a little odd.
It's not bad.
How old are you?
Thirty-five.
How much do you weigh?
195 pounds.
Can you really see through anything?
Uh-huh.
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
Do bullets really bounce off you?
Do you like pink?
Very much.
Where do you hail from?
Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
I gave him steady employment --
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
I...uh...check.
Otis...
It is for me.
Will kill him! And I'm going to have a piece of the rock! Miss Teschmacher, pack your --
Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
Oh, that. Listen  --  you're busy  --  and it's a long story --
No, Superman, of course not. You do get around, don't you.
Right, right. Where was I? Ah, yes --
And garbage doors.
We'll see how fast I can fly.
Ally.  That was my nickname.
Ally.  That's right.
How are you?
And what does he do again?
How is Mrs. Stephens?
We're...not together.
I'd heard that.  But she's well?
Yes...fine.
And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
Are you still in touch?
Which one?
Which clinic?
Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
She didn't.
But you said...
That's where I'm going.  To see her.
She's in trouble?
It turns to steaming piss.
That's okay.
Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
Alison.
Say hi to Zoe.
I hope she gets better.
I'll tell her that.
No you don't.
Not unless you can raise the dead.
Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...
They just finished supper.
Was it good?
Okay.
Yeah.
I'm not sure.
Goodnight, Nicole.
Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
The children.
She's resting.  In her room.
Say hello for me.
It does concern me.
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
Can't you make it later?
A while.
No.  It should be dry by now.
It's natural.
Your kids never cry.
I better get back.
Good night.
You believe that?
I have to.
Why?
Because I have to.
Well I don't.
About the Ottos?
Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
Do they have any reputation for drugs?

From what?
No.  I saw it on his face.
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
And what's that?
With our hands.
What do you mean?
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
Did his parents attend to that?
What do you mean?
Did they give him special care?
Because I'd be to blame, right?
Yes.  He does.
Billy said that?
I did.
Excuse me?
Yes.
Anything you didn't understand?
Hi, Dolores.
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
You hate it.
I didn't say that.
I'll just strap it on the roof.
No.  A little sugar though.
We've only got honey.
I'll...take it straight.
What happened to summer?
Summer's over.  It's fall.
And winter?
Well, winter's far behind us now.
Yes.  It's a present.
From you?
It's the truth.
No.
That's what he said.
Oh.
Yes.
What, Mason?
The people in the town?
Yes.
So he was mean?
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
Should I keep reading?
Okay.
Yes.  Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and...
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
I don't want you to lie.
I'm absolutely positive.
And what was the weather like at this time?
Thank you, Nicole.
Will you be spending more than a night?
Hard to say.  I might have...some business here.
People who will help our cause.
Crafts.
How old is she?
Is this it?
Here we go.
Thanks.
Yes.
Daddy?
Yes.
Don't you want to hear?
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
I tested positive.
Yes.
Welcome to hard times, Daddy.
What for?
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
Of...course I do.  I just thought...I could get you another
Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
Is there shrimp on it?
Yes.
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
I'm a lawyer.
You can't come here.
Yes.
No.
No.
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
You remember that much?
As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.
Yes.
Yes.
Why were you scared?
Dolores was driving too fast.
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
Yes.
Why not?
There wasn't time?
Really?
You mean it?
Of course.
I am.  Really.  It was awesome.
Nothing.
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
Does it fit?
The ramp?
Pretty slick, eh?
Very slick.
Do you like the colour?
It's okay.
Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
Oh.  I better get some spackle.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
As opposed to this T.V.?
No.
I don't know.
Will the police do anything to her?
There's talk of that.
You don't know that.
Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
But of course...
Alone or surrounded?
Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
Yeah, having supper with the Mrs. She's over there.
Thanks, I see him...
I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
We're on our way there now...
Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
I only had a few hours.
Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
I see you're full of human feelings...
I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
Why, has he bothered you before?
Is it news to you?
No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
I'm afraid I can't cope with them.
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
Did Sidney tell you about it?
No, I'm not.  I'm not!
Who said Sidney?
I said Sidney!...
Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
Susan!...
Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?  Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb.
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
Can I come in for a minute?
No.  You're dead, son - get yourself buried!
I have a message from your sister.
Everyone knows Manny Davis...  ...except MRS. Manny Davis.
Not just this minute, J.J....
You print them, don't you?
I like Harry, but I can't deny he sweats a little.
You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?
I read your column every day...
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
What does that mean - integrity?
Talk to her yourself...
I call him the boy with the ice cream face!
- He's got them on him.
Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
You're sure.  Find out for me.
Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?
At the bar - Sidney...
...cigarette girls... And naturally -
And where was his wife?
That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
Can you be there by two-thirty?
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
Yeah!
This sort of thing!
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
- that's what I mean!
He wants me to break a leg?
But what?
Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.
Help me with two minutes of silence!
Take a top coat.
Nothing...
I know you do, Sidney.
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  It's cold out here, Susie.
Why not you?
Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
Did you now?  On which bounce?
See me in my office.
You tell him, I stutter!
Yes, but why?
Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -
If you're funny, James, I'm a pretzel!  Drop dead!
I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
No, you had me eating that Chinese food!...
Why did you call me?
Oh.  I can't, honey.  I'm on a roll here.
What chip?
Now listen to me very carefully.
Let me try mine.
Yeah?  Who sent you?
Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
Liquid metal.
Radical.
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
I would.
No.  Only an object of equal size.
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
You told me to.
That is one of my mission parameters.
Prove it... stand on one foot.
Of course.  I'm a terminator.
What?
Cool.
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
No problemo.
It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
No problemo.
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
Dyson.
Drive faster.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
Remember what I said, you can't...
Trust me.
Where you going?!
What?
Terminated.
Yes.  Throw it in.
I'm sorry, John.
I have to go away, John.
Don't do it.  Please... don't go --
I order you not to!
Gimme that Phillips right there.
Where'd you learn all this stuff?
No!  Don't kill him!
It, John.  Not him.  It.
Alright, it!  We need it!
I love you, John.  I always have.
I know, Mom.  I know.
Go!  I'll finish here.
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
Unknown.
So do you.
I have detailed files.
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
Can you get us in there, past security?
No.  There is another chip.
Yes.
On all what?
On Furtwngler.
I don't know.
Respect your elders and your betters!
And no elbows on the table!
Eating is eating... and...
I don't know.
I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
I'm Steve. What's your name?
Some.
So, what does the Russki want?
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
So what is it?
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
David, what are you Counsel for the Defence now?  Did you hear the question?
and totally irrelevant.
Your manner.
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
We're dealing with degenerates here.
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
I have a duty.
Yes.
You do shorthand and typing?
Yes.
And your father was executed.
What's in those files?
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
I can't do this. It's not right.
What's not right?
I don't buy that.
It's the truth.
Did you call someone you knew?
Sure.
Your guess is as good as mine.
I was warned.
Who warned you?
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
What did Goering say?
I wish to say something.
Go ahead, be my guest.
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
Von der Null?
Yes, von der Null.
Von der Null?
I have no idea.
What?
You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
Of course I know what that is.
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Who's conducting?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
That's what I asked.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Do you know what's in this archive?
Helmuth.
Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
How could I forget?
Show you?
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
So. You wanted to see me.
Yeah?
One of your people told me.
Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
His private life?
When you got to the crescendo.
Right. Claims assessor.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
They said I was dogged?
Come to the office, please.
You're late.
Alright!
Can you handle it?
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
You know your weapons, buddy.
Wrong.
I'll do the same for you sometime.
Great.
You're a big help.
I hate the beige one.
Don't wear the beige one.
I thought you did.
You must have a girlfriend.
That's none of your business.
Aha!  Is she young?
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.
No.  Not yet.  Not for about forty years.
Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
Freezing.
Come here.
White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
It's okay.  Forget it.
Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?
You volunteered?
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
You like it?  It's my first.
Okay.  Talk some more.
About what?
About where you're from.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
What's that?
Why?
Fuck you!  Let go of me!
I want it to be over for you.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
A girl.  You know.
No.  Never.
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
And so you feel nothing.
It's better that way.
Oh, Kyle.
Ticklish?
You'll beg for mercy in a second.
You're not supposed to.
Cover...our footsteps...
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
Surrounded by living tissue.
Of course.
Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
Who is in authority here?
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
They've already been identi- fied.  There's no doubt.
That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
I know.
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
Send a unit.
I just called.
Call her again.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat...
Admittedly...
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
I apologized, I offered to help.
Clean out your locker.
Oh, no... you.
Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
I don't know... he fell.
I don't think he's breathing.
This can't be real...
He's turning blue!
What <u>is</u> your problem?
Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.
What... is... happening... ?
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
Where are you going?
Home.
Why not?
You first.
Please...
My hero.  Let's go.
What's C.R.S.?
Consumer Recreation Services.  It's their building.  They...
Yes... well...
You're the one who started running.
Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
That one did.
... two hundred dollars a toe.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
Nicholas Van Orton?  What are you, a czar?
Why... ?
That tall, bright building.  Near there.
Investment banking.  Moving money from place to place.
Hm?  Oh, yes.
Right.  Call me Christy.
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
Can we talk?
It's okay, dad.
Is this you?
Okay.
I thought...
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay?  Be right back.
You?
What's wrong?
Wha... ?
Not here!  They can see.
Nicholas...
God, wake up, it's a con!
Then, what good are you?
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
I didn't say anything.
Who the fuck cares?
It might be best if we didn't talk.
All I mean is... someone like you...
How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
Scams, con games.  How many?
I don't know.  A lot.
What do we do?
What... what do you mean?
It's out of your hands.
Nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...
Nicholas...
Get us out!
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
You call them...
... what... ?
Where'd you get that gun?
It's mine...
We searched the house.
Guess you missed it.
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
Nicholas...
Shut up!
Let me show you...
You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
Please, Nicholas, let me show you...
I have to show you...
No!
Claire.  Pleased to meet you.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Like... where are you from?
Originally, Connecticut.
Big family... small?
One brother, one sister.
Studied acting, I assume?
Julliard, yeah.
Single?
Yes.
Boyfriend?
Underwear?
Always.
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
Happy Birthday, man.
That's why it's a classic.  Come on, man... how 'bout a hug... ?
They'll be wanting it back.
Elizabeth?
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
You need anything?
No.
You shouldn't have.
Trust me.  Call that number.
Why?
It's a profound life experience.
Like a stroke?
Call them.  Trust me.
I said I would...
Are you still on mediction?
Why would you say that?
It doesn't matter...
I'm going to call.
Do it for YOU.
What's this all about, Connie?
Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
You dodged a bullet.
How do you mean, exactly?
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
You think I know?  I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
You're part of it...
What?  Connie...
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Split it?
It always is.
Yes.
I hope.
I know.
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
A game?
It's different every time.
Humor me with specifics.
We provide whatever's lacking.
And if nothing's lacking?
An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
Nobody knows, pal.  Nobody gets the big picture...  Jason, Tommy, cut it out!
How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.
They own the whole building.  They just move from floor to floor.
No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
I don't want money.  I'm pulling back the curtain.  I'm here to meet the wizard.
Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail.
It was a different floor then...
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
Don't take another step.
First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
Have we met?
Hm?
Is there a room key?
Didn't I give you two?
No, you didn't...
Have a nice day.
Thank you.  Goodnight.
Well... send my love, if you see him again.
Fine.
Goodnight then.
Ilsa... you're alright?
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
I'm not sure.
He came to my mind recently, that's all.
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
I'm just like him.
Nobody worried about your father.
Goodnight.  Where was she?
What's this about?
No.
The Hinchberger wedding.
A Mister... Seymour Butts.
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
Friend... why don't you back off.
Don't ask.
I checked it personally.
Follow me.
It was a misunderstanding.
What about the house?
Attempted murder.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
Greetings fellow sheep counter.
And what kind of sleeper?
Well, I... uh...
Who's Watts?
Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
I've read your tests.
You get your money.
Just stay there, Nell!
Luke.
You could have.
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
Yeah.
Maybe someday.
Where in the hell can she be.
Mary, I'll meet you outside.
You don't believe in the paranormal.
No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
Does she know that's why you're using her?
I, I just can't...
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
Well... we're glad to have you.
That smell... oh, God.
It was very specific.
All right...
What happened after you smelled it?
Yes.
I got more scared.
No you're not.  Something moved you.  You saw something.
It was a stupid thing to do.
Welcome Home.
Why?
I don't know.
Nell.  You will come here now.
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
No --
That?  That's Hill House.
This is where we're going?
No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
Mary came with me.
Nell, what do we do?
Oh!  You scared me.
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
Who?
Why'd she kill herself?
Yes.
She was unhappy.
Why?
So far.
I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
Fifteen dollars.
It's all I could afford.
I don't know what you mean.
What do you do?
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
I know.
The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?
No.  The world has missed you.
You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
What's his first name?
David.
No, it's getting worse.
Maybe you did it yourself.
Why?
Just think about one thing right now: What color?
Red.  What else?
Okay.
I do.
Just had to be sure.
Then let's go get you one.
Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum.
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
Am I a thing?
Well, you're certainly not a person.
I'm not.
It's not a knock.
It's not a compliment.
As soon as you get dressed.
What kind of food?
Anything but Japanese.
Why?
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
Oh, god.
I'm sorry.
Italian.
We all did.
I'm a gracious host.
All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
Why not?
Because --
Come over here.
Not bad.
Where do we go?
When you find the guy, you'll know.
There's been some trouble downtown.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
We'll find him.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
Well, can we make it one more.  Nowhere the fuck near me.
Let him break - he likes to break.
Huh?
You're in gun country now, my friend.
Been to the Boat Show.
Lookin' good.
Eduardo.  Rama.
You're home, then.
No reason.
Huh?
Snuffed her.
Y'what?
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
She didn't write to me, did she.
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
Not me, man.
Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.
Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
Has he?
See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
No one else is even here yet.
First in, first out, that's me.
Faith.
One thing I need.
Too easy?
Again?
Not much -- you?
Same.
Uh-huh.
Didn't get it.
Well, those are the breaks.
Hell, no.  I started writing.
Hard to miss.
You look alike.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Not her brand.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
No, why did you come here?
Been busy, have you.
How d'you mean?
It's been a while.
What was that, then?
Try calling me again.
Here, are you always this sarky?
Now who's being sarcastic?
Ashamed.
She never told Eddie, though.
She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
What's that, like a P.O. box.
Something like that, yeah.
Where you get your bank statements.
-- Mr. Lindgren.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
My employer.
What line is he in.
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.
Are you serious.
What do you think.
On what.  What makes you so certain.
I'll bloody well ask him.
There's the phone.  You want his number.
You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
Tell us about it.
Hey?
From pursuing your chosen profession.
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
Get seven years, did you?
Overnight.  What about just now?
Just now?  Overnight?
It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
Pushing the legal limit even then.
Only in the movies.
I've 'ardly ever left it.
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
What about your grandmother?
Black market during the war.
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Won't he be looking for you about now?
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
I fiddle it.  They got me down as an immigrant with five kids.
What's in Big Sur?
How do you know?
Bloke told me.
Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
So what's your beef, pal?
Eh?
Of the deal, man.
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
What am I doing?
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
He had urgent business in the north.
Ian?
You sure?
That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there.
No kidding.
Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
You're a reluctant traveller, then.
Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
Where else?
Could do, yeah.
Five thousand.
Hey.
I got half.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Yeah.
Which kind?
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
The L.A.P.D.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
That don't mean nothin'.
So what.
And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
Any happier than any other asshole in life.
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
Something's on.
What?
You bet.
Like what.
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
Walked.
Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
What do you think?
What are you doing here?
Exercising my visitation rights.
Since when?
I miss my kids.
I don't want you here, Terry.
Sure you do.
-- You know his name is Frank.
Is he here?
You know I don't live with him.
Who's looking for you?
Go now.
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
You must know Ian.
I don't.
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
Be seein' you.
Tell you ...
Ann. Will you come in?
Yes. Thank you.
And you should tell Doris...
We've certainly missed you.
That's what he keeps telling me.
He didn't say that.
But more or less.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally.
You're an enthusiast.
Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
It's OK...
Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--
Ah yes, a music lover.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
Well? How'd she do?
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
I can get it, yeah.
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
No. I--tell me--
Maybe.
You're out of line, mister.
Way out of line.
Right! Strictly business.
Yeah.
Cash.
Cash?!
Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...
She's a rare one.
How's business, Dave?
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
Uh-huh.
What is it, Dave?
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
But it's...
Please, Ed.
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
Come on in.
Big Dave--
Just coffee.
I, uh... thanks.
Mm.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
Oh, don't be a grump.
Who?
Dave.
How's that?
I didn't say a word.
How are you?
What happened to you?
You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer.
You don't have to tell me anything.
He and Doris... were having an affair.
I... just knew. A husband knows.
I don't know. I don't think so.
How did you get into the store?
I took Doris's keys.
Oh, hell. Drink?
No thanks.
Sure you don't need one?
I'm fine.
OK. Boy. Jesus!
Yeah. What do I, uh...
Taking it seriously.
So, who should I--
I'm fine. Thanks.
No thanks, honey.
Yeah, the best.
I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
Yeah.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
I know who you are, Mr Crane.
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
How d'ya like them apples?
Huh?
Russians exploded an A-bomb.
Yeah.
Jesus...
Yeah, yeah--go home.
Huh?
This hair.
Yeah.
...You ever wonder about it?
What the hell are you talking about?
OK.
You don't got a headache?
...Nah.
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
The hell with it, Eddie!
Huh? No.
What'd he say?
Birdy...
Hello, Walter.
Crane. Ed Crane.
Yeah--
Hello.
We're just closing, friend.
Could you come with me please?
Ah.
Second chair.
Not an owner.
Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya.
Uh... you're under arrest.
Under arrest for murder.
He said OK. Is that what he said?
It better be good.
I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
Someone broke into this room.
Anything missin'?
You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
Behind you.
What's the combination?
Calm down.  I found it!
Let's go!
Like hell!
Where the hell are you?
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?
What's left of it.
Mind if I have a look?
Where's the head?
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
Call me Vince.
Unfortunately, no.
Apparently it's huge.
I think I should come with you.
This door's locked.  Try shooting the hinges off.
The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
May I see that?
This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
Got my hands full here.
I know.
You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.
Oh shit.
All right everybody, hold up!
Dr. John Whittlesley.
What's that doing here?
I'd say we're in its home.
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
Right.  The entire brain appears to have been extracted.  May I see it, please?
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
You must.
What are they?
They're eggs.
Don't stop now.
No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
We will.
Look who's here, Margo.
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
You said you had plans of the museum.  Could we see them, please?
Footsteps!
They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
Yes, I do.
What do you do?
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
What is it?
Not that big.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
You're color blind.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
Not yet.  Let's try the fork to the left.
Keep the light up.  I can't see.
Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!
Holy mother, what is that?
Get back!  Now!
Quiet.
Another storage room.
Keep the animal quiet.
What?
Frock's been fired.
What's that?
There's another possibility.  A lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage.
It's reptilian.
What kind of hormones?
Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
How about lunch?
You have time to talk?
I don't understand.
How did you know that?
A monster?
I don't know.
Behind me.  Over there.
All right.  If you're positive.
No.  I think I'm hallucinating.
Gone.
Wounded?
The planetarium!
Vince!
What are you going to do?
It's scared of me.
I think... it means it's full.
Then it won't go after the others?
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
Oh God!  Help!
It's coming.  Run.
I have to shoot.
Do it, quickly.  Please.  Aim for the eye.
You have to.  Do it now!
<i>Fiji.</i>
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
Viti Levu.  For how many?
One.
It's the busy season.
I thought you were in a hurry.
You want to book the flight?
No, hold back...
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
What's on the ClockCam?
He gave it back to his father.
It's just a matter of time.
Why would we--
Sweep the harbor.
<i>Storm</i> music...Wagner...
Do it!
Thank you.
Of course.
I prefer to think of it as a mirror.
Certainly a nomination.
And it's all available in the "Truman" Show" catalogue.  Operators are standing by.
I'm the creator.
You're the star.
Shhh!
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
Sure she would.
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
Oh, yes.
Lauren, right?
That's right.  Lauren.
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
--I'm not allowed to talk to you.
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
You have a boyfriend?  Of course you do.
Saturday?
If we don't go now, it won't happen.
I think I've studied enough.
I...I can't.
Yeah?  Outta what?
Sorry, I'm way behind.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
I think I'm mixed up in something.
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
I've got to show you something.
This is where it started.
What exactly?
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
It's a surprise.
They're...  perfect.  Thank you.
Did something happen today?
I've been thinking--
Oh, God.
That can wait.  I want to get away.  See some of the world.  Explore.
I think I'm going to stay up for a while.
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
How do you know?
I made macaroni.
I'm not hungry.
I still want to look over a couple of things.
See you in a minute, sweetheart.
What's the hurry?
Oh, my God!
What do I do?
I don't know--
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
Put some butter on it--or ice?
--we need more charcoal.
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
You're upset because you want to go to Fiji.  Is that it?
What?!
That's right.  I do, don't I?
So why do you want to go?
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
You blaming me for the traffic?
Should I?
There's been an accident, Truman.
Uhuh.  There's no accident.  It's just more stalling.
I bet you did.
I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
I've tasted other cocoas.  This is the best.
You're part of this, aren't you?!
You're the one talking to the walls!
How's your hip?
I feel certain my condition runs in the family.  Can't this wait, dear?
Things always do--when you look back.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
Sure.  Okay.  Fine.  Can you pass on a message?
You got it.
Fine.  I'll tell her.
The whole area's being evacuated.
Well, thank you for your help.
You're welcome, Truman.
Who?
There's no one here.
You must listen.  Everybody's pretending, Truman.
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
You can count on it.
We don't even know you.
Well, we're FBI agents.
You're not FBI agents.
A woman?  Work.
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
They took her --
Me?
Yes. I know.
Agent Mulder.
Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
Is it an emergency?
Kurtzweil, we think.
I'm looking for him.
Looking for him for what?
Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
No. Just fossils, far as I know.
I know the name. Why?
Old friend of your father's.
Before the bomb went off?
Do you?
Not according to the men in blue.
You can't.
I'm not sure. A virus --
-- You saw this experiment?
What did it look like?
Your guess?
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
You've been using me --
You didn't know my father --
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
Where are you, Scully?
I'm on the roof.
Did you find something?
No. I haven't.
What's wrong, Scully?
No you didn't.
I just did. You're buying.
Scully, I found the bomb.
Where are you, Mulder?
I'm in the vending room.
Nice try, Mulder.
-- Mulder! Get in the car!
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
What? What are you talking about?
No.
Why not? It's three AM.
I was until about an hour ago.
Get dressed, Scully.
Mulder -- what are you doing?
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
And you're looking for?
I can't really talk right now.
Evidence of a massive infection.
What kind of infection?
I don't know.
Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
It looks pretty green for this climate.
No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
And where are they going with it?
Where would they be going?
We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
I don't know why I think they went right.
This is great. This is fitting.
-- of what exactly?!
Mulder --
It may be extraterrestrial.
I have no idea.
Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
For the purpose of what?
Yeah...?
Come on!
I don't know.
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
You can't quit, Scully.
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
Just like that --
I think... something stung me.
No -- it's --
Where are we?
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
General McAddie's.
Well, call General McAddie.
I don't have his number.
They can patch you in through the switchboard.
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
Where's Scully?!
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
I don't know.
I'm not taking any chances.
I've got to find Scully.
He's come and gone.
I have answers for you.
Is she alive?
No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
My life is over.  Go.
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
No, you need only take away what is most precious to him.
A pocketful of rye...
Four-and-twenty blackbirds.
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
Someday you can.  We all believe that...
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
Shush.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
No.
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
Why did we stop?
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
He needs to be turned over.
She said convincingly.
What happened?
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Baked in a pie.
What's wrong?
I don't need them anymore...
I know.
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
...give a kiss to Edward.
Give a kiss to Edward.
How hard could it be...?
You don't know the procedure.
Do you think that's funny?
Ah, the part of us that can't be explained.
Peter, okay?
What did you see?
You're the shrink, you tell me.
I did, yeah.
Evil.
If you believe that.
What happened to Charles Gish?
What difference does it make...?
Tell me.
Yes.  I am.
Like hell "wait."
Little boy?!  That's him!
Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
I can't leave him!
Absolutely.  Abigail...
Good for them.
I got it.
No problem.
No.  Thank you.
He's beautiful...
's broken.
Oh no... No you don't.
That hoist, with the winch...
They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
Initiating connection.
What's wrong?
She's bringing Stargher into hers.
Sometime yesterday morning.
I'll get her...
Yes.
Absolutely.
Any psychiatric medication?
No.
No.
Dr. Kent.
You're looking well.
Awaiting his arrival.
What about the cat?
Completely unaware.
Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.
Now?
Now.
Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
She remembers because it was her "dream truck."  Wanted one just like it.
No.  Can you get a man close?
What else do we do?!
Next time, tell me, okay?
But you looked so cute.  All sleepy...
Considering where I've been...
Ja, ja, ja.
Das worren nooh zeiten.
They think you did it.
Sit down.
Do you understand German?
No, no...oh...excuse me.
No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea?
You were in love with him, weren't you?
He has a little dog.
Oh, yes, yes.
Were you at the inquest?
Mmmm.
I was told there were only two men there.
They're forged.
Why?
Whiskey.
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
Silly looking bunch.
Need we go through it all again?
Just another part I've got to learn.
In German?
Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
Well you read this.
What's that?
"Ein hurigan" - I guess.
Tell you what?
Where is she?
Tell me more.
Anna.
It's just what he used to say.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
Holly.
I'm so sorry.
It's all right.
Yes.
What's the matter?
Let's not get into any more trouble.
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
Me.
A parrot...Let it go.
Have you seen Calloway?
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
He told you, didn't he?
I'm sorry.
Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
I shall be all right.
He's safe in the Russian zone.
How do you know?
I saw him today.
Oh, the usual things...
Oh, well.
Why are you lying?
We're getting you out of here, aren't we?
Thank you.
Keep the packet.
Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.
Yes.
That's the reason.
I have never seen him.
No.
What did you say? I'm sorry...
They'll be returned, miss.
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
Just around the corner.
Thank you.
Can I have that woman's passport?
Fellow called Lime.
Martins.
You a friend of Lime's?
Yes.
Been here long?
No.
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
Once in a while.
No, sorry.
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
Best thing that ever happened...
What are you trying to say?
He was...
Ever seen one?
Pin it on a...
Well, you could say that murder was part...
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
Getting around, Martins.
Oh, pinning things on girls now.
Calloway.
You're not locking her up?
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
In Vienna...
Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
Bring him in.
I can't. He disappeared...
Thank you. Excuse me.
This is where he vanished.
I see.
I suppose you don't believe me.
Fifty yards right down there.
Which side of the road?
She's right. It's none of my business.
You all did.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
Win what?
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
Two thirty.
I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
Well, there's not much time.
One can't just leave - please.
No, no. Leave them for a while.
Oh, Mr. Martins...
Do you know his number?
No, I don't know...
I'll look it up for you.
Well, look, is there a car here I can use?
I know a very good dentist.
I don't need a dentist. Somebody hit me, that's all.
Heard of Harry Lime?
What is it, Sergeant?
Who?
Never heard of him.
Very popular. Are you staying long?
Excuse me, have you got tooth...
Yes.
It's good to see you, Holly.
She's been arrested.
Holly...
I told the police.
And - Anna...
Did the police believe you?
You can get somebody else...
Outside of your stories...I've got to be careful.
I wish I could get rid of this thing.
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
What did you expect me to be - part of your...
What do you want?
Zwei zwartze.
Tension? KURTZ Suspense.
At the end of every chapter --
What did he say?
But he said he died instantaneously.
What's the name of this girl?
But you will.
The Roumanian?
How do you do.
Vinkel.
Coming to the point, please.
Thank you.
Hear the details.
Not necessarily.
English?
Mr. Lime's.  Accident...
Yes, sir.
Mr. Lime - yes.
You remember me? Upstairs...
Yes, yes, I remember you.
What does he say?
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
Who else?
Yes.
Yes.
And?
You don't mean that doctor?
I am not a bad man.
Something wrong.
What else?
He didn't want to get involved.
Joseph Harbin.
Joseph Harbin? No...no.
A novel, Mr. Martins?
Not when I get interested.
Yes.
Why no, Mr. Martins.
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
His name?
Okay.
Yes?
I'm Daffy.
Richard. Hi.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
We moved rooms because of him.
There is one problem.
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
So?
So how many miles do you think it is?
I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
We're ok.
I think we're about half way.
What!
A fin!
Yes.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
A bit fucking late.
What happened?
Fuck off.
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
But he has been there, off course.
It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.
Two.
Richard?
Eh - bonsoir.
Not too bad.
We swim.
Swim?
No.
One night I will get the perfect photograph.
Richard, you know something -
It's just the sky, Richard.
Where did you lose it?
What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.
They had Sabra and Shattila.
He's an asshole.
Fine, go ahead. Touch the letters.
Who the fuck are you?
Then I won't bring you....
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
I don't, but...
Let's look at the fucking thing.
Why the fuck not?
Just don't.
You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
You will.
Maybe I am. Maybe we're all Jews now. What's the difference?
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
Too difficult?
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Abstraction. They're obsessed with abstraction.
I just read it....
You want it to be an event.
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
Killing himself.
That's stupid. Why would they?
Yes, I am. Basically I am.
Bigger and better.
Then how come you're talking to me?
Why won't you talk to me?
I'm talking to you right now. Who's Linda?
You can't.
He's at a home out here.
I stole it. From a synagogue.
What do you care?
I'm good at languages.
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
It looks a little like a swastika.
Even though his dick is so big?
With you there's a tragic dimension.
Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...
V'asitem...
What's it about?
Don't curse in front of it.
Why should I submit?
I told you, I'm good at this.
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter.
You want a punch in the mouth?
I don't know. I just want to try it.
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
No. What are you looking for?
You don't own this place.
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
I doubt it. How did you find out?
Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
I'll go look....
Who's Eichmann?!!?
Nothing. Let's go....
I'm stealing it.
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
Obviously.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
Notice? Like what...?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
I don't know. Is that right?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Everybody likes to, don't they?
Those aren't Jews.
Of course they're Jews.
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
So you're saying it's not true.
Look at me.  DO I look Jewish?  Look...
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
Why would Nadelman lie?
No.
How do you reconcile the two?
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
The arguments, anyway.
To hear them read Torah.
I thought you hated Torah.
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking.
This is me.
How did you...?
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
It was a nine millimeter.
You're lying.
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
Fucking kike.
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
You do it on the inside....
Don't tell me what I --
Yes!
Daniel Balint.
Balint?
It's German.
From the Rhineland originally.
Ilio Manzetti...former ambassador to France. Managing partner at Damon, Schwarzchild.
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
Fine.
What is happening?
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
That's meat.
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
Steve's going to explain it.
Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?
Tell it to Hitler.
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
You can heat them up and eat with him.
Isn't it true?
A Jewish prayer.
Number ten.
Get out of here....
The mother.
What...?
Here...
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
Christ...
You said they didn't have night guards.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
Mrs. Moebius.
So what do we do with the device?
I have an idea....
Just do it.
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
Are you an artist?
Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
Four. But no one this important.
I can tell....
How?
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
What are you trying to say?
What do you think you should have done?
Do I give a shit?
Exactly.
Dennis Leary.
Leary?
No.
Obviously.
Funny?
Not like Mr. Dorfmann.
He was funny.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
Just a little... What's the difference?
So what?
They're not that Jewish.
What?
Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?
I was just trying to make a point. If --
Danny, please, we don't want to know.
And let us say...
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
Does he know?
No.
I can't... I just don't know how to...
Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
... You take care of yourself, Johana.
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
... So am I.
The mafia!  La Cosa Nostra!
Italian is practically the same thing.
You know each other?
Yes.
Enzo Molinari.
In a lake.
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
Don't you agree, Jacques?
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.
Enzo!
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
What else is there?
You know what I'm talking about.
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
I won't, I swear.
You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
Don't.
Why?
That idiot!
Lira?
Dollars.
Six seconds.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
Eh?  Si!  Avanti!
"That"!  This is not a "that"...
He's training.
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
It isn't lit yet.
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
... What's your name again?
Noireuter.
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
Try speaking to me?
I dove 315 feet!
Great!
What room have you got?
I don't have one.
Forget it.  I was joking.
You're staying at the hotel?
What?
Your mother?
... And his friend, Johana...
Get in the car!
Then, it's very chic.  Avanti!
... For the mermaids.
Everything about what?
Well... about everything.
Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
What is it?
Yes.
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
Thank you, thank you very much!
No!  I would never cheat you.
Well that's very nice of you.
... I was right about what?
I can't.
Jacques, take me back down... Please.
Does anybody live to make a second?
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
Tea... or whiskey?
No... in the hut.
Thank you.  I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
... Okay.  I'll try.
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
I'm being a pain in the ass.  It's beautiful here.
It's too loud for me.
Thank you...
... Especially the sneakers.
Lucky I was there to save you.
I'd better get back now.
No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!
... The way she moves.
Uh... Yes, of course!
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
It's me... Johana.
I got fired.
Well, then, talk to me some more.
Uh... Ah!  A story?
It's me again.
You sure?
Absolutely positive.
I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis.
I didn't dive.
You'll try again tomorrow?
... Nothing.
You go back, I'll walk.
You want to lie down for a while?
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
I saw how it has to be.
You are the father.
Anything.
... Are you sure?
Positive, Sir.
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
What?
Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
I brought Johana to meet you.
Johana... New York.
In my apartment?
It's my apartment.
The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
Louis, we were French!
That's different!  What's the matter with you?
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
What?
How was your trip?
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
Haven't you been listening?
Does that have a hidden meaning?
No.  I'm just depressed.
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
Of course, that's what they're for.
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
He isn't going to breathe.
Coffee might be nice.
... Yes?
Let him sleep.
What's up?
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
My Esther! Oh Mordechai.
I know sir. I won't let you down.
It's Esther.
Please, call me Mordechai.
Yeah, no kidding.
Sure. Why not.
I said, do you come here often!?
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
Mordechai!
Mordechai!
We go to the same temple.
Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
...I'm not finished yet, mom.
Happy Hanukkah Morty.
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?
He's still working out some identity issues.
Take a look.
Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
No, it was the perfect level.
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Take a look.
That depends. How much money has he?
Mmmyes.
Nice fellow?
What about me?
You get your money from your husband.
If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
I sleep it off.
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
And my leopard - - maybe he hurt the first girl -- but no more.
They don't say it to me.
Let's get in your truck.
Up at the museum.
No. I'm serious about this.
What do you want to see him for?
I want him to lock me up.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
I don't know. I want him to lock me up.
You found the leopard!
All men are fools. They like to make a big show - shout and hunt --
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
Let me see it 
Tomorrow -
Rosita  I have wondered -
What, senorita?
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
I'll miss you too, honey --
I want to ask you something.
You're worrying about its killing someone else?
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
We're old friends.
More or less.
Yes.
I don't know.
No.
It was you.
Not! I tell you. No!
Tell me.
Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone 
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
Now look what you've done.
And I suppose you don't feel bad!
We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!
Yes.
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
That doesn't make sense.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
Absolutely sure.
I got into a little crap game.
That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways 
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
I know -- Teresa -
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
That might depend on where youre going.
De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
Im afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
You wouldnt recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir.
That depends what youre looking at.
Can it be that easy?
Can it be that you want your brother found?
Disney! How inter...
Theres more. Your brother also purchased a young boy for 15,000.
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
I cant tell you that yet. But hes being well looked after.
Perhaps I should come back when youre...
Im impressed. That information could have cost me 20,000.
Have you got a pen?
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
...7548. Have you... Have you found him yet?
Yeah. Goodnight, Mrs De Moraes.
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
When did you get back?
Sorry?
You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?
My brother hung himself.
Think what you like. But dont presume to understand.
Good.
Is there anything to understand?
Why do I feel I neednt answer that?
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
...Were turning in circles.
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?
Something like that?
Something like that.
Where is that?
Simplify and damn.
Dont you believe in simplicity?
Should I?
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
I dont know. Everyones dead...
Your parents arranged the visit to my office?
Can you tell me how you spell...
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
Croissants.
Europe...  France. Im French but I live in London...  ... England.
Youre a long way from home...
Im fine standing, thank you.
Yeah.
I know where to look.
Right... Well, Ill get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
So who... Whos the man? Where is he?
Do you know a friendly cop?
Its up to you whether they walk or not.
Huh! And they say charitys only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...
This is a bad line.
What sort have you got?
So, what are you looking for?
What about an untrained pup, white...
Have the money ready by 11am. Well call you.
What...?
You... Fuck you!
Where is he?
Who?  Martin... Hes Martin...
No... No...  I swear...
Where?
What?
Finsbury Park. Were in Finsbury Park.
Where are the kids?
What kids?
The company. We all work for the company.
Just me...  Martins gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
Where is it?
Downstairs... At the front... Jesus...
Can I have the reception desk, please.
I certainly did, sir...
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
So you havent seen the film, then?
Bye bye, Jane. And dont be naughty.
Yes. How did...
Thank you, Jane.
What if it is?
Recommended?
Do what, Mr Lombard?
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
I presume you checked your sons apartment...
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
My rates...
Plus a trust fund to provide for the boys education.
We conclude our transaction.
Does it matter?
Is my money in there?
Huh, I doubt it...  Friedman only deals directly with select customers. I handle the rabble...
No. In Hampstead... Why?
Dont jump any red lights.
Shut up and drive!
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Could someone have hurt you that bad?
Dying without ever reaching the top...
Hyatt... Friedmans... at the Hyatt...
The Hyatt...? Whats that?
Ho-hotel... Los Angeles... He...
Three oclock.
Le Mercury. Newman street. Ask for Peter.
Should I come back in five minutes?
I dont recollect mentioning a friend.
Wheres your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
Shut up! Wheres your wallet?
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
Should I be?
Albert... Albert and Ethel. Why?
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Is she on the phone?
Ive been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
Fine...
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Excuse me?
I take it you dont know where he is, then?
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You dont know Leon, do you?
What about which girlfriend?
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pr- pubescents.
Viens.
Mon bureau cotait trop cher.
Alors quoi?
I dont have your credentials, Nathalie.
Who?  I dont know who the fuck youre talking about, sunshine.
Fuck...
Three...
Glucks dead, you sonofabitch!
Huh! Youve been around, eh?
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
So why didnt he?
What do you think, huh?
I can only tell you what he told us...
Shut up and walk...
Its a good guess...
Costliest!
Whats that? A word?
What do you think?
Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
What do you mean?
Of course I am, it's just that...
Good.  Until then, feel free to live like a king!
Louis... water and fresh straw!
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
Better today than tomorrow.
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
They've started the battle without me!
No, it's... it's nothing, it's...
Come with me...
Jeanne, no...
So... what am I supposed to do now?
What... what do you mean?
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
I don't know it.  I feel it.
You make it sound so simple...
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
To be killed in battle?
It would not be the same without you.
Do as I say!
I want to stay with you...
That's an order!
I -- I don't understand...
One day you will.
Jeanne, you can't leave us like this!
Sound the retreat...
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
I don't know, but you're all men of the church... why not ask Him yourself?
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
Didn't you also carry a banner?
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
To avoid killing anyone.
No, I... I held it up to...
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...
Performing a miracle.
Rouen is in English territory.  I have the right to do anything I like.  Take them away.
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
Dead you're worthless, darling.
Where... where am I?
Guess.
And God who allowed you to be caught?
No no, I'm fine, really...
What about you?
But where are you going to be?
I'll be right here... I promise.
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
How old are you?
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
What did it tell you?
Many things...
You have nothing to regret...
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
Thanks be to God.
And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
Then her faith will have to be bigger.
I'm... I'm not the king...
... and my crown doesn't fit and...  Really??
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
Does he have hair?
Yes.
That's not a lot.
I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
Yes... they were.
Good.  Where are the English?
Everywhere.  Where is the food?
He's on the other side of the river.
For what?
The wind will be with us!  Do as I say.
We're taking back the Tourelles!
I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
The bridge won't wait!
Not yet.
The English won't wait.
As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
Good idea...
No good?  This is a disaster!
But the bridge has been pulled down!
The English are rebuilding it.
Perfectly.
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Reinforcements?  Where??
Never look behind -- only ahead!
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
The clothes are not important...
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
Because... because you just can't!
Here -- take this instead.
Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
Sorry Jeanne...  Did you both meet already?
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
Were the men confessed?  Where are the priests?
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
If you kill him, you kill me!
Who gave you that horse?
My king.
How many did he give you?
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
Playing...
I -- I -- I...
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
Nothing.  I'm here to set you free...
I might ask you the same question.
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
Why?  Are you waiting for someone else?
Who?
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
Because... I have to be alone!
What do you mean, they won't come?
Why would they?
Yes... lots of things!
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
Oh?  You can't remember?  Let me help your memory...
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
Do you think this cross will protect you?
Are you going to leave me too?
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
Are you sent by God?
Yes, my lord.
Let's see.
But you already confessed this morning...
I need to confess again.
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
Oh yes, she's... wonderful.
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
Yes, it is.
Then... why are you here so often?
He never says his name.
What... does he... look like?
Why did she have to die?
Only God knows the answer to that.
I want to be with him always...
Who wants me to stop?
It's like this... I...we...all of them.
Yes.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
He's still a doctor.
No one plays Chopin like you.
Dorota.
Come in! come in!
He'll be back before curfew.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
Just over a year.
Dead.
Let's find out.
I'll be fine.
What's happened?
What, I'm working, what?
They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
What?
Funny time to say this.
wish I knew you better.
Thanks.
I haven't seen him.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
Tough luck.
It costs.
I've no money.
Who told you?
Who's recruiting?
Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
It certainly was.
That makes a change.
You know what we do? We use psychology.
Just shut up.
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
That's better than yesterday.
What did you pay him?
They were taking you away.
That's also my business.
You'll be deported.
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Please, don't insult us.  Can you do something for him?
Wladek! How are you?
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
Cow!
Pig!
Bitch!
Dirty pig!
You're a dirty pig!
Takes one to know one! Pig!
Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
It's a little cut, nothing.
Where are we going?
Out of Warsaw.
Out of Warsaw. Where?
I'm not going anywhere.
No, I don't think so?
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
I am... I was a pianist.
A pianist.
In the attic.
Show me.
Not yet.
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
Watch your feet!
Watch his hand
Oh yes, dear too - TERRIBLE! AWFUL!"'
Ohh no, it makes my skin creep!
No, it was a table.
There is something to be said for silence
Ohh the tag is broken.
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
And where did they get married?
Ohhh I've never been there. 
Yes, it's unholy.
I'll be back.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
Someone died here. It's tapu.
No, no they know another track - to the side of this.
Yes
What for?
The piano.
Yes, I thought that.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
You don't want to learn.
No.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it.
You mean in signs?
No, words. You have never heard words?
No, not words.
I'm sorry, I can't do that.  I don't have the time.  Goodbye
They are washed.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
I just want to listen.
It's quite safe, they are managing...
I have the key here, look, I'll have it mended...
It's my mother's piano.
A piano?
It must come.
Hello.
She never gives him a turn.
Play a song then
That's right.
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
Who told ya this guy was in here?
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
Right through there.  But I wouldn't go in there if I were you. 
7 to 2.  That ain't bad.
He'll probably fall down.
Don't worry, we got the wallet. What happened?  He get ya with the knife?
Naw, it's okay.
Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'. 
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
What makes you think you can trust him?  He didn't do shit.
You got a bag or somethin?
How 'bout a handkerchief?
Here.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
I had some appointments.
All of it.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
I think it's the best...
If that's the way you want it.
That's the way I want it.
Use Salino.  It'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it.
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
He was a con man, wasn't he?
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way.
I'm busy, Floyd.
Mottola.
They're still looking for him.
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
Good lad.
You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
I can talk, can't I?
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
Lonnegan after you, too?
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
You never do, kid.
You know anything about him?
Why?
If we ever get to it.
Well we got some workin' money anyway.
Yeh, it was easy.
What do ya mean?
He threatened to kill me.
Did he say he wouldn't?
No.
He'll show.
I thought I'd lost him.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
It was too noisy.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
Yeh.
You wanta wait for your share?
Naw, I'd just blow it.
That's why he won't know it.
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
See ya and raise three.
Five and call.
Pass.
Raise 500.
Raise 5,000.
What are the odds on Syphon?
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll.
Where's June today?
You doin' anything tonight?
Yeh, sleepin'.
He'd like to kill me.
Yeh, this time anyway.
If I expected somethin', I wouldn't be still standin' out here in the hall.
No.  They're just the only ones we know of.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
Well we can't talk in here.  They're having the place painted.
How ya doin', Jimmy.
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
Three grand on the black, Jimmy.
What do you mean?
Then why the rat?
660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
If I'm not there by quarter of, I'm not coming.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
I am after this race.
Give 'em a little time.
You're a lucky man, all right.
Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.
Why don't ya then.
I'm in.
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
If your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more.
No.
I don't know, figure something out.
On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
We missed him.
You weren't hired to miss him.
I don't know.  He took it hard.
All right, get outa here.  You're outta work.
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
He'll never do it.
I think he will.
Come on, gimme a break.
Sorry.  Don't know a thing.
Yes.  He admitted it.
You know how they are... sex...
Then just say he was sixty years old.
Is that what it means?
Of course.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
Oh.  I'll do my own typing!
It's all right.
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
I can't find him.  I've tried everything.  I thought you might know.
He's just around the corner.
Said he stole his invention.
Do you suppose.....  ?
Nothing.
You better take a drink.
Another young man.
It's the same one.
And if it isn't?
Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 
What are you talking about?
Do you think I care
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
Oh, here she is.
Nothing.
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
Then what are you hiding?
I'll do nothing of the sort.
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
Now do you believe me!
And I'll give then proof!
Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
He's waiting for you.
What do you mean?
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
Yes.
Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
tried him once -
Why don't you try him again?
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
I've got to see you alone!
Yes.
There. 
Why... in the heart.
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
I don't know.
She... she fell over backwards.
I bought it in a pawn shop.
Don't lie to me.
That's the truth.
Forgive me.  How are you?
You see how much we have to say.
This is my wedding.
If you think it'll be all right.
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
It's a promise?
He's all right.
You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
He's a brave man.
Only in bad weather.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Better get home before it is.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
I'm very interested in that body.
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
Was there much blood?
Gilbert!
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
know.  But I saw him -
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
Ask him.  I don't know.
I'm asking you.
Keep on asking.
No.
Who's is it?
Nothing yet to cinch it.
He's holding out on you.
Let's go and see.  Taxi!
I think we're on the right track.
Who're you calling?
Nunheim!
This is enough for me.
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
Could this be him?
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
I'll take care of him.
No.
Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
--was Wynant's.
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
Seen any signs of it, Bill?
Oh, then you did hear from him?
He telephoned me today.
He did!
About three.
Did you go?
Yes.  But he didn't show up.
Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.
Goodbye.
That's nothing.  I saw him myself.
Let him have his say out.
I guess all the suspects are here.
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
Want to take a poke at him?
I didn't mean you, Mister.
You've said that for weeks.
I know.
All right.  All right.
I couldn't go near that woman.
I said all right!
Just what I said I'd do.
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
Chris -- Chris -- !
Never mind.
So I see.
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
You're going to return every cent of it!
I can't! I haven't got it!
What did you do with the rest?
I never had it.
Good.
But suppose some business comes up...
That's just why I'm going.
Never mind.
What'll I do if something comes up?
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
No.
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?
Hello, Mimi.
You're always teasing.
Yes...
They'll want more than your word for that.
All right, then -- I'll tell them who did do it!
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
Oh, did he?  What did he say?
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
I didn't knock Julia off.
All right - you didn't.
This is your party.
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
Hello, baby.
I had him out this morning.
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
If you like 'em like that.
You got types?
How many drinks have you had?
Six Martinis.
That last Martini.
Santa Claus.
We need ice.
What are you drinking?
Rye.
What are you going to do with it?
Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
Yes.
No.
No thanks.
They were kidding you.
I'd like to see you work.
Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
Breakfast.
All right... shoot!  I mean... what's on your mind?
Someone get a doctor.
There's one coming.
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
I'll get some towels. 
Yeah.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
No.  It's a Christmas present.
Who gave it to you?
You did.
Who's that?
Macaulay.
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Is that another Christmas present?
Yes.
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
Your guess is as good as mine.
Oh take it!  Please take it!
Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present.
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
All right, hard guy.  Get up and bleed on the rugs.
What's the matter with you?
But Wynant --- ?
I don't believe he did it.
Why don't you?
Come on, Watson, we're going places.
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
What are you going to do?
Say you're the one who got me in this!
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
You bet I wouldn't.
Not with all your money!
You dog!
Goodbye, darling.
Sure I will.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
What do you mean?
He was down in the shop.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
That's a fact.
Wynant's body?
Sure.
Couple of months anyway.
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
No.  Nobody but you.
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
Got a nice evening dress?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Got a nice evening dress?
I've got a lulu -- why?
Who do you think did it?
Mimi!
Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner..... 
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
I wish you'd tell me.
I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
I don't know.
Why are you saying it?
It's the only way it makes sense.
I hope you're well.
How did you get in here?
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
You his wife?
Yes.
I know I left them there.
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
Maybe she has.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
I just wanted to tell you...
Home!
Home?
Who fired you?
You did.
What's in the other direction?
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
Turn the car around.
It's a fortune box.
There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.
Better grab up some sand to take home to your family.
No, please, not again.
We're going to keep driving.
Oh, Jesus, they've stopped.
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
They shouldn't have been out this way, that's all I'm saying.
Low on gas.  Got to refill.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
For climbing.
Yeah.
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
Let me see the map.
Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.
Move!
What about it?
Maybe we should split it up now.
You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
You don't know he isn't.
He's an enemy soldier.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.
It's a combat action.
No.
Get out of my way.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
Suppose I don't go for that?
I have to answer him.
If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
No you're not.
Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
There might be something in there.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
There might be.
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
But we all got to be in for this.  We all go, or we do nothing.
We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
Roger that.
You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
Oh, that's fun.
You know, you sound just like a boy who's never--
Wh-what do you think--
TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
We can see them, they can see us.  We run, they chase.
It's the only way.  We drive!
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
Let's go.
Millionaires, man.
We leave it.
I got that...sir.
Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you.
Mine.
Mine.  Land mine!
I heard it click.
Just be cool.
It's a mine, isn't it?
Just relax.
Why you got to move away to talk!?
We're going to be right over here.
Epps...
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
It's the treasure, that's what it is.
Shut up and listen!
It's a fire fight.
What are they doing here?
Something like that.
Stay low.
Where the hell is it!?
They're going to kill us!
They can't shoot us in here.
So where do we start?
What does it look like I'm doing?
Is it dead?
Yeah, Bwana, you got it.
I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
Not when you're up here with the gold, I guess not.
How!?
We'll find our way!  We'll...
What if he's not?
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
They'll search the pack.
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
And you; you've got it all together.
Is it all right if I stand up?
Yeah.
I don't want to die.
Makes two of us.
Okay.  Then we go this way.
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
Well, we should identify ourselves.
And then what?
And then shoot them.
I don't have a weapon.
Shi'ites, I think.
Is that good, or bad?
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
Why haven't they killed us!?
With what?  Against how many?
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
Me?  I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.
We go this way.
The...the gold...
You shouldn't think about things like that.  It'll just make you crazy.
Yeah.
What?
Thought you were going to buy a car.
He'll slow down.
He's going to slow down.
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
Just...want to be ready when we do.
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
The photos.
Oh yeah.  Accidently.
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
I thought it would be good to know.
Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
Now you need me.
Yeah, you're funny.
Naw, nothing.
You will.  You'll get it.
What?
That's in two days.
Like I said; so?
What!?
You ever think about dying?
Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
It's a container.  Break the seal.
Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
Oh, no.
Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
How the hell should I know how much?
You know what I'm doing with my half?
Oh, God!
You see that?  Right by us.  They went right by.  You had them Epps; you called it.
Yeah, well, we're not.
We got to get out of here.
Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
You have to go with us.  You can't walk back...
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
I know you're a pussy.  I know that.
We have to do something.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
Lines up with the map and the photos.
Guess we know what the next stop is.
Yeah, we're down.
All last night he could have been--
I think he wants something to drink.
I'm not wasting my water on him.
Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
You actually got around to killing someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're only half a bitch.
Correct.  Origin?
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
Violation?
triple three, triple three! easy.....
Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.
Correct.
What happened?
4732...?
Too low.
No, Tetanty.
You've seen enough.
You know I don't feel well.
Eat your dinner.
Now.
Now?
I have to... he's a G-34
Don't be so sure.
That's not food.  Can't be food.
Looks like food.
What?
I'll try.
I don't know.
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
Don't let them separate us.
AH UGH.
They're watching us now.
No one can see us now we're alone.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
It's wrong; so wrong, what we've done....
No!...No!...
What?
We're leaving.
Who?  Who's leaving?
THX and me.
But you can't.  We must escape.
I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
No, look!  Three degrees from the central azimuth.
You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
What?
What?
Why are you so concerned?
Where's LUH?
What?
When?.....How?
Right now.
But you can't...you.
Look!
I was lost.
...and you're not lost now?
No, I...
Look more closely.
What?
Too late....stay close.
What kind of answer is that?
I don't know.
I don't care.
All the insides are gone!
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
Shut up.
No?
No......  She's dead THX........
You don't know that!
Where's LUH?
Look more closely.
I'm only trying to help you.
What do you want?
Save yourself....
I thought of something.....
I can't understand.  The sedatives....
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
They're not here.
Where are they?
And you are...?
Officer Reilly, vice.
We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
No thanks, Bev.
Go ahead.
Aren't you on suspension?
Just do it.
Hang on.
You the Bomb Squad?
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
Anything else I should know?
Don't push it, slick.
Where...?
Drive.
I don't know. You tell me?
Look, it's a longshot...
Bingo!
`Til we get a better lead.
What?
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
Be right back.
Where you guys at?
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
Should we head for the Interstate?
Off the scale.
What do we do?
Right.
Nothing.
Okay, let's go in.
Stay to your left.
I don't know.
What... ?
How the hell do you feel yellow?
No excuses, just do it!
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
Oh shit...
We work fast enough for you?
Hey, I'm next.
Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?
Helluva fuck factor.
Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.
Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
We've created a monster.
Reilly! He's loaded!
He's my brother...
People are dying.
Alex-
I know. I warned them.
Security.
Nothing... just tired.
Stay here.
Stay in the truck.
What? Nobody, I-
Shut up!  Who is this?
Take him!
A ticking bomb...
Nothing so far.
What about the ballistics report?
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.
Look, it's important.
Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead.
Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
I don't know...
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
Fuck factor ten.
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
What was it this time?
She wanted to cook me breakfast.
Yeah, just a nick ...
Don't talk.
Ain't that a shit--
Quiet!
It's about this.
Captain assigned me to assist you.
Huh?
My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
That feeling won't last long.
Goddamit, Reilly--
I thought I told you--
Report on the case so far.
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
I promised her she'd be safe.
It's our only option.
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
Pull back. You're only an observer.
We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
And diamonds in the front.
Yes.
Diamonds all over.
Well, have you found it?
erect in sweater, arms folded.
He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.
I had exactly twenty thousand lire. I had just cashed a traveler's check and put it in my wallet.
<u>Niente!</u>
About tonsils.
<u>Tonsili!</u>
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
Well--then it must be my mistake.  I beg your pardon.
Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba. 
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
No.
Constantinople?
No.
You've never been in Constantinople?
No!
<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
You're looking fine, Major.
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
The type they marry.
Like it?
Smart. London, eh?
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
I thought so.
Just dull.
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
And, waiter--you see that moon?
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
I want to see-- 
Yes, Baron.
And as for you, waiter--
Yes, Baron?
Thank you.
I hope so, too.
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
And I have known the Lavals of Marseilles for more than thirty years.
Um-hum!
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
No, not at all!
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
I don't <u>know</u>, M'sieu Giron!
But not now.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
No, to you--M'sieu <u>Monescu</u>.
Otherwise I'll call the police
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
What is it?
You say I am a crook.
I know it!
Monescu.
M'sieu Monescu!
Just call me Gaston.
Thank you, Major. 
Good day, Doctor.
Good day, Major.
No, Captain, I tell you--
No--no.
I would like to.
No--proud. Very proud!
No, thank you.
Gaston Monescu.
Gaston!
Last year? It can't be that long.
Sweetheart, what day is today?
The fourteenth of May.
Two fifty-three, five--
Seven and nine!
But it's not enough!
They're all right, aren't they?
Yes!  Now don't worry!
By the way, how is your German?
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Now, Lily--
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
Lily-- 
Lily!
You like that statue?
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
The pleasure is mine, madame.
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Naturally I did.
Oh!
That's what you need!
Peaches and cream.
Do you realize I have light eyes?
Make it out to cash!
As you like. 
Yes!
Beautiful specimen.
I see.  She must have been very happy here.
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
It's disgraceful!
You're hired!
And so will M'sieu Giron.
Then riding together.
Um-hum ...
Then lunch in the Bois--
Together.
Then a little nap--
How do you like my dress?
Hair?
Marvelous.
Lipstick?
Good night. 
Good night.
Goodbye.
Precisely.
No--yours, madame.
Yes, I would!
Like that?
I know all your tricks.
So you think you can get me?
Any minute I want!
You're conceited--
But attractive--
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
I'm crazy about you!
I know it.
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
I <u>believe</u> you.
Then why do you want to go?
Because I want to make it tough for you.
But I don't want to be a lady.
No--thirty-five! 
Call the police?
Instantly.
Um-<u>hum</u> ...
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Mariette!
Yes, Gaston?
Adolph J. Giron.
And you expect me to believe that?
Naturally not. But I expect the police to believe it. 
I don't believe it!
Goodbye.
It could have been marvelous ...
Divine ...
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Goodbye ... 
Yes, Madame Colet?
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Yes--uh--
No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
Yes, madame!
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
Please!  Thank you.
May I?
To me he seems rather nervous.
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
For all the really important things--
How much is your salary?
I beg your pardon!
But you're the more intelligent one.
That's true.
Then why did you do it?
Because I hate him--because I love you!
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
Yes, my bag!
Didn't you take it with you?
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
But you saw it here.
Yes, I saw it--but--
Well, where is it?
An hour, two at most.
You're certain?
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
Hurry, Rose.
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
And to you, Mr. Andrews.
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
You are, Lewis.  You rolling?
Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.
Don't drop it Rose.
Rush her.
...Mrs. Calvert?
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.  Come on.
So do I.
It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.
An accident?!
Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you --
What do I tell your mother?
Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic.
Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
Good. Settled then.
Can I bum a cigarette?
No caviar for me, thanks.  Never did like it much.
Almost as good as you.
Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
No, but we're making excellent time.
We've struck ice.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
No.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
Uh, yes. Of course. After you.
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
Jack.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
Is he your boyfriend?
Worse I'm afraid.
So don't marry him.
If only it were that simple.
It is that simple.
Just some sketches.
May I?
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
You wouldn'ta jumped.
You're still my best girl, Cora.
Just move with me. Don't think.
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
You're right. Only you can do that.
Sssshh. Come here.
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.
To the stars.
Au contraire, mon cher.
It's okay. I'm alright.
Could it have damaged the ship?
He couldn't have.
I know, I know.
I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
I'll be right back.
I'll wait here.
We'll find out.
Right.
Never let go.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
You think she was really there?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.
I should like to see my drawing.
Just tell us what you can --
You had it the entire time?!
Excuse me.
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
Goodbye, mother.
Do you want the truth, Anya?
It would be a nice change from you.
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
I'll join you later.
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.
Glad to see you again.
That's a date. 
We'll save you a place at our table.
Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
I think you do.
No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
Where's Lother?
What did you want a gun for?
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Get moving--
If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink. 
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
Fine--I'll be glad to.
Want to take it back?
I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
Yes--
You've got lipstick all over you.
I could stand some more--
No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
How about giving me another coat?
Good-by.
There's soft music--
Have we?--Well, I'd just as soon play shuffle-board.
Well--breakfast?  Lunch?
Brett is the name.
Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney.
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
Even Cupid's becoming modern, using medicine balls instead of darts.
--you want to adopt him!--Good for you!
Very--your mother?
Don't be a c-a-t.
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
Well, I can't.
Don't rub it in.
But I'll have cocktails with you.
At seven-thirty?
Sooner it you like.
Okay.
Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
I'll be there--Good-by.
Sorry.
Thanks.
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
Don't let's talk about it.
You said it! How about a little action?
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
Good night, idiot!
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
Lose?--I won a little--
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
Come on--let's take a swim.
I'll be waiting on deck.
I thought you were a smart guy.
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
We coulda got two third-class!
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
I'll give you half of it.  Here's seventy cents. 
Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.
Shortie, look!
How're the tips?
A dollar forty.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
--there's thousands of 'em!
My change.
Change?
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Are you screwy?
I'll take one. 
Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
Partners, ain't we?
<U>Me</U>!
Sure! McKinney will never suspect you--
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
On the drunk.
Get it!
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
It's a pleasure.
Much better--thank you--
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
Why isn't that a good time to quit?
Think again--
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
I'll go with you--
No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
I'll go with you.
Swell!
Coming to the pool for a swim?
Thanks. That makes us square.
Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
What'll I say?
In New York.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Cut it out.
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
No. <U>Knots</U>!
What?
Knots!
Yes--Me--in person!
So what?
<U>Nuts</U> to you too!
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
Miss Marsh.
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Is this your gun?
Yes!
Just what the doctor ordered.
No--not much--excepting-- 
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
I'll never love anybody else.
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
Very serious?
Very--
Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--
You don't shoot squirrels.
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
Well, let's hear the poem--
I'm getting seasick--
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
What's he got that I haven't got?
Well, he has a straw hat--
So what?
Get that out of your trunk.
Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--
Easy kid--easy....  Come on--I want to talk to you.
Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
About twelve hundred.
I went for four.
Thanks to me.
You leave the kid alone.
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
I'm not so clumsy with fingerprints--
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
Maybe you will after you've thought it over.
I sincerely hope so--
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.
Thank you.
Thirty one's and two ten's?
"Smooth's" the word.
Aren't the roses beautiful?
What!--are you crazy?
I'll explain later--
Let me look at it.
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Then why did you run away?
Because you ran after me.
500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
Isn't that a daisy?
Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
Nice voice.
That's not what I meant.
Yes, very.  And very married.
Oh, so that's it...
Not now.  I don't have time.
You will after tonight.  Bet on it.
Well I'm not so go home.
Beauty, ain't he?
I asked where you got him.
Where do you think?  I stole him.
And you must be Doc Holliday.
Good.  That's real good.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
We're gonna get along just fine.
Excuse me?
You retired, too?
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
Yeah, you look it.

Forgive me if I don't shake hands.
But who was the Devil?
You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
Ignore her?
I'll remember you said that.
In vino veritas.
Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.

Revenge?  For what?

You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
Damn!  All right, wait a minute...

What?
No.
I made a promise.
All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
I know.  Me neither.
Yeah.  Or undertakers.
Never even heard of anything like it.
It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
Easy now... That mare's in season.
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
I have a better idea, let's run It out of them!
You'd die for fun?

I forgave you the moment you said it.
You did.  Well... thank you.
Wait!
I think I'll just lie down awhile
They're just lonely is all.  Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
Oh, all right.
No really, I can stay a while.
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?
I don't know.  I'm all right.
Really?  You sure?
Just thinkin' out loud.  Forget it.
'Least you admit it.
You wanted to talk?

You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
You're the boss.  One thing, though.
McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither.
I'm not a lawman, I'm just a Private citizen getting' my Property back

We'll see about that.
So he can tell the story.
They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.
We'll go around that way, come up on foot.
Well what do you think happens When you die?
Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
I read this book, book on Spiritualism...
Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, I'm serious!
Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
I'll be damned...
Fine.  Better.
I'm the one made a mess.  Made a Right fair mess of the whole thing.
That didn't sound like thunder.
You're on.
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
Isn't true.  I can't see a damn thing.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Well I'm real scared.

So to speak.
Kinda, actually, yeah.  I gotta admit.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.

Bring up the tracking satellite. And get 007 out of there.
GET BOND OUT OF THERE.
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
And I have the entire British economy to worry about.
You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
Sir Elliot.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
Good-bye, Mister Bond.
Chernobyl will look like a campfire.
What about the gold?
Him? He, is a she -  at the bar.
Four o'clock. M will meet you in the conference room.
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
- We all want what we can't have?
Not all of us, 007.
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
Is that any way to say hello?
I thought your specialty was good-bye.
Is this another one of your games?
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
Do you?
Just hold me.
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
Well... If you insist.
Gone fishing.
Fishing?
Not from forty feet.
Hey - the world is my office.
Let's take a look at the body.
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Step into my office.
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
She married a hockey player.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
Can you arrange a meeting?
He tied one on.
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
Wait a minute -  I've got it. There! Off the port bow!
That's reassuring.
Interesting video tape.
Depends what number you write.
Happily.
... Kids?
Three. You? Married?
No.
I didn't think so.
You too.
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
Let's not make it a habit.
Think about mom.
- The family jewels?
- You're not.
No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
What?
Blood or Dutch?
He was my father's best friend!
He's killed closer.
You are seriously deranged.
No. I'm going with you.
My father left me the business.
What do you mean?
Cleans dirt. Let's go.
Up.
Don't say it.
We blast through.
Next time, I do the driving.
I didn't say when I want to die -
Now.
Of course.  Minister Johnstone.
Only what I read in the newspapers.
'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.
It seems, 007, we've received a tip
Good luck on your mission, 007.
What do you make of all this?
It doesn't quite add up.
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
Indeed they are.  Deadly little things.
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
Tsi tien, Professor Wu.
I am. What do you want?
Captain Morton.
You leave me no alternative.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
Seems to be back to normal, sir.
I see you two have met.
- I told you! He was there! -
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
My timing always was lousy.
Approaching the first gate.
Start the grinders.
You have to leave -
You come with me -  You stay here.
Fueled and waiting.
I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!
Yes. Shall we kill them?
It's Bond!
Kill him! Finish it!
You disappoint me, Number Three.
Thank you sir! Thank you!
One to seven: Deal the face cards.
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
What's in the box, General?  What's in the box???
Maybe. Maybe not.
Abort the cruise.
Will the cruise set it off?
Since when?
We got the same thing.
Oh here we go with that.
They're too big.
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
You always got something to say.
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
I told her I would if she would give me time.
My name is Sam. Samuel.
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
I guess it proves you really care about me. You hung in there.
Babe Brother.
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
Well, you look better than you did yesterday.
I'm going back home with Harry.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
Harry is coming to pick me up.
You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
I heard his voice as clear as day. I better get back. Maybe something is wrong.
Not anymore, not in the city.
Now how far would further out be?
I'm not here to argue, sir.
Go back to sleep.
You all act like two roosters.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
You're always taking his side.
Hush.
You're going to find yourself on the floor.
It would be nice.
No, I'm too hot now.
Just stay in bed and rest.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
I will appreciate that.
You must have been really sick.
How is the garden doing?
How is that hen doing? I was meaning to pip her before I fell sick.
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick?
What happened to your hand?
I cut it on an old rusty knife.
It's healing now.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
But these are white people, anybody. The punch...
He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.
I'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger?
It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
I tell you, I feel like a ghost.
I'll be right there.
Tolerable well.
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
I hope that it's nothing serious.
Let me get you a cup?
Only if you can spare it.
Good afternoon to you.
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
Emory had made a lot of enemies. He had a big mouth.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
No, I'm a different person now, Harry.
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
That is a boy from home, Lulla's brother.
Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say?
I already have, my dear.
You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
Don't shout!
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
Where is Skip?
He is in his pigeon cage.
I'm sorry he got those birds.
You know the man next door is near death.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
Whadda ya think?
Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
You can bring ONE toy...
Just one?
No, I haven't seen him.
But Mom, I can't find him!
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
Sure!  I'll even let you drive.
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.
Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
Where was the last place you left him?
Right here in the van.
Bye, house.
What?  What is it?
Here!  In the car!
Let's let Molly open one.
Rocky!  The ramp!
Mm-hmmmmm.
HO-YAAAHH!!!
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
Can!
Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
All right, then, I will.  Stand back everyone!
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
I'd better take a look anyway.
Sure is a hairy fellah.
No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!
But we're not on my planet, are we?
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
Go away.
Sorry.
Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
We've got to get out of here...NOW.
What?!
It's ok.  Everything's under control.
NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!!
Look out!!
Woody!  The rocket!
The match!
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!
We're not aiming for the truck!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
Everyone, it's Woody!
Sorry there, old Spudhead.
I got dibs on his hat!
Miss.  G-6.
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
Heh-heh.
Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
How 'bout three out of five?
Murderer!
I don't know!
Oh no, Hannah!
What?
Look!  Janie!
She's sick!
No she's NOT --
NO-O-O... Don't touch her!  NO!
Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --
Will you quit moving around?!
How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
A lunchbox...?!
Alright!  That's it!
I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
Now, it was an accident!  Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
You murdering dog!
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
I was close to being scared that time.
Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
Oh, I don't like confrontations.
There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
He got it, Woody!
Sir!  No Sir!
Okay, thank you.  At ease.
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.
Uh-oh.

It's busted.
That's right.  Your toys.
Right here, Woody!
No, Slink --
Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
Sh-h-h-h-h!!
I knew you'd come back, Woody!
Speed up!
Slink!  Hang on!
There's no mirror.
Excuse me.
You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.
I carried you up to your bed.
Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
Didn't you know he made things?
I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
Home is where the heart is.
I can't go home because there's no home left.
She'll have to learn.
What about school?
Get away from me...
What did I do wrong?
You're only a young thing.
You're not so old yourself!
Living with him put years on me.
Let me in.
I finished it off.
You did what?
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
Can you move over a wee bit?
Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
I've got a present for you...
In my pocket.
H'm?
It was only a mouthful!
All the time.
Everything is gone, now.
Nothing is left but us.
Storms?
You're late for breakfast.
Victoria -
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession.  Easy to make it disappear.  For you, poof, it's gone.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
I can't find Manolo.
He's not here.
Nine thousand dollars.
Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.
You will believe me, because it's true.
Arnie, thank God.
That's a very apt analogy, Helena. Now, go home and be with your children.
I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say.
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
I can't do that.
Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --
What?
So my wife is lying?
Goodbye Arnie.
It's so frustrating.
Me, too.
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
Why?
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
No, not yet.
Me, too.
So's the video camera.
At least she's alive.
Honey, your father knows the President.
That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
Not yet.
Are you going to?
I don't know.
Is this bad for him?
What do you think?
Hi.
What's up?
I got that.  How was your day?
I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
Somehow, I don't see that happening.
How long's the job?
Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
Like I give a fuck.
Oh, yes I can.
Sixteen
Live with your parents?
Yes.
Yes.
Do you work?
Cincinnati Country Day.
Yeah.
How are your grades?
I'm third in my class.
What's that mean?
I get A's.  All A's.
You do?  What else you do?
Just watch.
What is this, like freebase?
Not like.  It is.
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
Yes, mom --
Then here's a little bump.
Who do you work for?
She knows Arnie Metzger.
So does half of San Diego.
You want to make a wager on this?
Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of God, my ass.  We're wasting our time here.
Winners don't do coke.  Or haven't you been reading the bumper stickers?
I don't know.
She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
Depends who it's from.
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
Arizona.
We're playing!
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
We aren't barbarians.
Yes, sir!
You will dine with me from now on.
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
Yeah.
What's he doing up here?
I don't know.  Something.
They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
Your new friends.
What?
Where?
I feel like a traitor.
Javier Rodriguez.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
What is it you want me to do?
A small thing.  Nothing really.
Only if he can be trusted.
He'll do what I say.
So what's it doing in Tijuana?
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
I need to find my daughter.  I'll pay you.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
Just tell me where she is.
She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home.
She hasn't called you?
I don't know what to say.
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
We sometimes went downtown to score.
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
Agents who died in the field.
What do you mean?
He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --
It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --
No. On you go.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
Bit fucking late, like.
Well, why didn't you bring them?
You've stabbed me, man.
You were in my way.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
Sorry's no going to dry me off, you cunt.
I've no fucking cigarettes.
Can you not go yourself.
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
What's your name?
Diane.
Where are you going, Diane?
I'm going home.
It's where I live.
Great.
What?
think I left something back at the -
Ssshh!
Sorry.
Shut up.
What?
Out.
Come on.
And don't make any noise.
Holding hands?
No, not holding hands.
Easy for you to say.
Can I see you again?
Certainly not.
Are you clean?
Yes.
Is that a promise, then?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
You're too young.
Too young for what?
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
What? Steady like?
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
Sixteen next month.
Happy birthday.
Well, he's young and he's healthy.
It's an interesting theory.
He forgot. Useless motherfucker.
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
Eh? How's that?
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
Do you recall the school motto?
Of course, the motto, the motto --
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks.
No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.
It's no problem.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
Spud, they're my sheets.
No.
Following the game at all?
No.
No. Me Neither.
Aye.
Clear?
Aye.
That's nice.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
Have you got any gear on you?
No, I'm clean.
Cheers.
Now remember --
Yeah.
But try too hard --
And you might get the fucking job.
Nightmare.
Running time?
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
Director?
Lewis Gilbert.
Screenwriter?
Eh - Ian Fleming?
OK, so who was it, then?
You can look it up.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
Who wrote it?
Roald Dahl.
Roald Dahl. Fuck me.
OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
I don't rate that at all.
Despite the Academy award?
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
That's your theory?
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Give me the gun.
Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.
I'm cooking' up. There is a silence.
It wasn't that bad.
Did he -- you know?
What?
You know.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
He made me lick it.
God, you're sick.
When are you going to visit him?
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
It was just an idea.
Four Grand.
But you don't have the money?
We're two thousand short.
That's tough.
Well, it's up to you.
The Sick Boy method.
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
That's hardly a substitute.
you'll need one more hit.
No, I don't think so.
To see you through the night that lies ahead.
Your favourite dish.
Excellent.
Your usual table, sir?
Why, thank you.
Yeah.
Sure will, pal, sure will.
Are you serious?
No joy yet.
How long is it?
Six weeks.
Six weeks!
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
Six weeks and no sex?
I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.
Well, I've paid for the ticket.
What?
A walk.
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
And how did you breach the Barrier?
With a starship!
It will be your chariot!
You doubt me?
Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
Rescued at last.
Return to prearranged coordinates for pickup.
Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
Plotting our new course.
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position.
Position, Bird of Prey?
Closing.
But the shuttle-
DO it. Go to Red Alert.
A Federation starship.
Do you realize what you've done? It wasn't bloodshed I wanted.
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
No, but you can bet they will.
Understood. Kirk out.
What do you know of my pain?
Let us explore it together.
The power was within you.
What is it you seek?
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
If we could send a distress signal...
Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
Put it on the screen.
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
Because it's there.
Ah, Captain?
MM.?
I've always known... I'll die alone.
I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
Are we leaving, Captain?
I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
Yes, Spock?
Life is not a dream.
Yes, Captain.
Goodnight, Bones.
Goodnight, Doctor.
Yes.
Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
But he does seem familiar?
Who is it he reminds you of?
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
Mr. Sulu. Execute.
Yes, Captain?
Yes, Captain.
Let me do something.
Captain, what have I done -
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
I ordered you to defend this ship.
You ordered me to kill my brother.
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek.
I have a half brother.
I gotta sit down.
He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
Is what possible?
That's a little vague, Spock -
"c."... "k."
The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
It must be all those marsh melons.
The emergency channel, open.
Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
It's all right, Captain.  Proceed.
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Not possible. You were never alone.
Yes. I lost a brother once. I was lucky. I got him back.
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
I'll take you to the bridge.
I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?
No. I refuse.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
Am I? We'll see.
The ship needs its Captain.
No special conditions?
No conditions.
Because you, too, must know.
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...
Spock...



  


I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
I had a feeling you would say something like that. So I brought us dinner.
No. You must kill me.
You know I'm right.
I know you better than that.
Do you?
I cannot go with you.
Why not?
I belong here.
I don't understand...
Sybok, we must find a way...
No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
You haven't told him?
Hi, Flynn.
Uh... got any cinnamon?
You call that getting over it?
I mean I want both of us to go.
To warn him.
Of what?
That Dillinger's on to him.
For being on to Dillinger.
I'm certainly not.
Hello, Alan.
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
only yes and no...  You're a bit.
Right on the money!
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
Not a chance.
Let's get outta here.
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
End of line.
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
What do you want with the Pentagon?
Thank you, no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on.
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
Well, isn't it -- ?
Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
Greetings, program...
You're alive!
Yeah, I... oops!
Yes.
How about you?
Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
It's too far!
Let's get some power here.
Why? What are you going to do?
Shhhhh.
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play video games better than anybody.
How 'bout yourself?
Tron...?
Recognizers!
Alan-One...
Good luck. You can't even think in here.
Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
Are you kidding? You guys'll he running this joint by then...
End of line.
I don't have time, Sark. And neither do you. End of line.
The Users...you really think they're still there?
Do it!
We have to.
I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
Why is everything...like this?
It's a flat. But wait a micro...
I had to...in the games...
Then I owe you some thanks...
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
We have to get off this beam!
I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
It's something Users do.
Where's Flynn?
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
Yeah.  You know Harry.
Will you shutup.  I should never have told you about him.
Out.
Yeah, Dad.
Fine.
Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
Unbelievable!  Trent told me he wrote it.  He's history.
Dad.  You just think you know everything, don't you?
In the helicopter.
What?
Yep.  Sleep fast.
Here, check these out.
What?
She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.
Right.  She's only fourteen.
Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
Stay on him.
Just hang a minute.
I'll just hang then, shall I?
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
Put a tap on her phone.
What're you talking about?  We have that.
Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house.
Yeah, but for who?							*
What are you talking about?
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PAGE!!
The purse is still at the house.
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
But you didn't.  Why not?
So, it was your first time.
I wasn't cheating!
I agree.
Yes what?
Not exactly.
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Sure.  Say that now.
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
Okay.
Me too.
Yeah, it was wild.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
What did you tell him?
Yeah.  It was great.
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
My husband the hero.
They said you had to run out.
He needed my help.
Well, maybe a little.
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
Yes.
Why?
What did you need?
Answer the question--
Louder please.
Yes or no.
You will be contacted with the assignment.
My husband can't know about this.
No.  Doris.
I'm not wearing any.
Harry, be quiet.  Let me handle this.
You wouldn't believe me.
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
It makes you tell the truth?
Is it working yet?
Are we going to die?
What about Juno?
She's really a fox, isn't she?
Did you pork her Harry?
No.  But I wanted to.
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
God, you have great legs.
Do you still love me?
Yes.
No.  Much more.
Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.
Sorry.  Trade secret.
Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn!
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
Get going! 
Go ahead.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Fuck you.
I'm sorry, I can't.
You can trust me completely.
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
Yes.  Now go.
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable.
Find out who this Renquist it.
His wife?  Good.  Bring them.
Hello, Alabama.
What letter?
What letter?
Nope.
You can't have just one.
This is great, we got cable.
Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.  What do you think would taste good?
Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.
How come?
Oh, hush up.
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
The letter he sent.
Ya looked through it?
Now hang up.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
Thanks a lot.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Is that your real name? Really?
That's my real name, really. I got proof. See.
I took a cab.
'Bout twelve.
No. Not particularly.  How come?
Would you like to get some pie?
I'd love some pie.
How 'bout me what?
Tell me about yourself.
There's nothing to tell.
What do you want to know?
What do you do?
I don't remember.
Where are you from.
Burt Reynolds.
Very much. Now, where were we?
What kinda music do you like?
Almost four years.
That's a long time.
At the movies?
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
You're not stupid. Just wrong.
My pimp.
You have a pimp?
Uh-huh.
A real live pimp?
Uh-huh.
Is he black?
Will you be my wife?
You will?
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
I don't believe so.
Thank you.
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
I just gotta get somethin'.
Write down Drexl's address.
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
I think what you did...
What?
... was so romantic.
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
How come?
Why Cancoon?
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
Naw naw!
Can you live with it?
Live with what?
You wanna get unhaunted?
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
He don't got no right to live.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
She's with me.
Who the fuck are you?
Fuck you! My mother was Apache.
It's great to hear from you.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
Get the fuck outta here!
Has he gotten his mail today?
Now tell him goodbye.
You goin' out?
It'll get ya high.
I certainly hope so.
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
I don't know! A fuckin' lot!
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
Elliot what?
Elliot Blitzer.
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
Let me handle this.
No shit? Dick, that's great!
Yeah?
Um, nothing, let's go?
In case of what?
Really?
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
Yeah, OK.
Unloading? That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime.
What do you think, eightball?
The police department?
They'll be along.
I guess so. Follow me.
Yeah?
Get on your knees.
No.
You are the dumbest person in the world.
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
No. Not yet.
Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
A Norms in Van Nuys.
Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.
We grew up together.
Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
That's about all I ever eat.
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
You were a cop.
What makes you think I would do that?
I got some money I can give you -
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Step inside.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Thank you.
Could we try it now?
Absolutely.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Uh-huh.
That was a good fuckin' movie.
Sure was.
Do you believe him?
I believe he believes him.
We talked him into it.
Or a bit player -
That is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions.
You do.
Hope you're a good actor, Elliot.
How the fuck could he know?
He saw the wire.
How's he supposed to see the wire?
He knows something's up.
Rock whores.
Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
Just put it in your purse.
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
Put it in your pants.
No.
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Do you live here?
Exactly room-mates.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
No.
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Where's that?
Well, you go down Beechwood...
Donowitz, he said.
I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.
Uh, what?
Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
You're still a little... disoriented.
Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
I need to go.
Do you know why you're here, James.
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
You don't have a driver's license, James?  Or a Social Security card?
A jail?  Prison?
Underground.
What's wonderful about the air, James?
It's so clean.  No germs.
You're afraid of germs?
I have to go.
July.
July?!
What year is it?
What year do you think it is?
1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989.
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
No.  That's the reason they chose me -- I remember things.
No more drugs.  Please...
1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
What?
Clues?  What kind of clues?
Who's keeping an eye on you?
I did him a favor.  Now come on.
I've got one now.
Lock it now!
Jeffrey Mason?
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
You have to give yourself up, you know.
The gun! ... I lost it
You're sure?
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
Just like that?  You were in prison?
No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
...I had a dream about...something like that.
I...I...We need cash, James.
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop.
It's private.
Not, "what", babe!  When!
Monkeys.  Twelve of them.
Plan?  What are you talking about?
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
Who am I supposed to shoot?
Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered.
Yes, sir.
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
You see what I mean?  You're being defensive.  Isn't she being defensive, Bob?
You're insane, Jeffrey.
No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.
Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist?  And now she's spray- painting our building?
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
I'll be right here...just in case.
Might be tight.
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
You want something, old man?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
What do you want for free?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
I won't hold my breath.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
I'll bet my watch against your pay.
That's my morning's pay.
You got two years on me.  What's that make me?
It is not.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
I need a ticket.
Out of here.
But, in particular?
I don't care, just get me there.
One way, or round trip?
One way.
Thirty even.
The ticket is thirty dollars.
You Harlin?
Nope.  Darrell.
Harlin around?
He's up at the Look Out.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Time.
What time is it now?
Twenty-after-ten.
Ninety-two.  Only gonna get hotter. I remember one time . . .
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
Don't look like nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
Hundred-fifty.
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
What?
Yeah, but it was shot.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Yeah, you better remember that.
It is morning.
Come back when the sun comes up.
You got the money?
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
Let me have a Beck's.
We ain't got no Beck's.
Kirin?
I think I burned my gun hand!
Yes.  Yes it is.
Who the hell is this!?
Wrong number.
They look nice.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
You didn't hear something?
How could I?  I was sleeping.
There's someone in the house.
What does it look like?
When did you buy a gun?
I'm just going to my car.
That's right on my way.
I don't know your real name.
Maybe I don't want you to.
My cup runneth over, beauti--
It's Grace.
May I carry your package, Grace?
I got it.
What happened to your hand?
Accident.
You should be more careful.
You're welcome, Grace.
You're not from around here, are you?
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Thank you.
What do you do anyway?
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
Those are white words, not ours.
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
Lift me down.
Beautiful?
Like they're made of polyester.
Such as?
Still playing?
You know what I want.
No.
Did you ever?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I don't know how.
You just walk away.
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
Have you ever been there before?
Is it pretty?
I can't.
Jake.
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
How much money has he got?
Kill someone.  I can't do it.
Jesus Christ!  Listen to yourself! I can't do it, Grace.  I can't do it.
There is no us, remember?
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
What was I supposed to do?
I don't know.
There has to be!
I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
We're going all the way.  Together.
No.
What about him?
To get my car.
You liar!  You wanted him dead.  You seduced me into killing him!
What?
He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.
You killed him!
He was going to take the money.
You killed a man for no reason!
Now what?
I think I busted my leg.
Can you climb back up.
I'm here.
Where the hell am I going to go?
John, you have to throw the keys up to me.
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.
And you're not one to lie, are you?
You idiot!  You'll kill us both!
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
Fuck you!  Do you hear me, John!? Fuck you!  John . . . John!?
I'm her husband.
Husband . . .?
Grace, tell him.
Accident.
You've got to be--
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
I'm a solid man.
John Stewart.
What brings you to Sierra?
Ah, I can smell it on you.
Would I what?
Would you kill her?
This is a joke, right?  You just want to rattle me.  Right?
Just ran into a little trouble.
No.
You just seem to attract trouble, don't you?
I was hoping we could talk.
About things.  About your wife.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
About what you said this morning.
You're talking like a mad man.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
What makes you say that?
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you.
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
I need thirteen.
That's a bit much.
No.
You didn't kill her?
The time wasn't right.
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
All I have in the world.
Trouble with the car again?
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
There's another reason?  It better be good.
I came for Grace.
You came to take my wife from me?
I came to kill her.
Liar.
That's a thick change of heart.
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of.
I said come on!
What?
Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
How about I pick one out for you?
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
But you was going to fight for me.
What's your name anyway?
You expect me to believe that?
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
Stand up.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Oh, shit!
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Give it to me!
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Not as bad as it looks.
Nope.  No problems up the road.
I don't understand what the--
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
Soda.  You got any soda?
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
No!
But, Senor--
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
Senor, you need a doctor.
No police!
You want something, old man?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
What do you want for free?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
...And everything is nothing too.
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
Christ, I don't believe this!
Stand up.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Oh, shit!
Give it to me!
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
Who the hell are you?
I'm her husband.
Grace, tell him.
It ain't broke.
You've got to be--
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
I'm a solid man.
Bobby Cooper.
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
Darrell's a moron.
Live there?
Ah, I can smell it on you.
Would I what?
Would you kill her?
How do you know if you've never tried?
I was hoping we could talk.
Talk?  About what?
About things.  About your wife.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
About what you said this morning.
You're talking like a madman.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
What makes you say that?
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
I need thirteen.
That's a bit much.
It's not what you think, Jake.
You came to take my wife from me?
It's the truth, Jake.
How about I pick one out for you?
I've had time to get over it.
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
You're too quick for me.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
But you was going to fight for me.
What's your name anyway?
Nope.  Darrell.
Harlin around?
He's up at the Look Out.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Yep.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
But he's dead.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Great!
Time.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be careful with her, will you?
Don't look like nothing.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
Hundred-fifty.
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
I want my hundred and forty-five dollars.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
What?
Yeah, but it was shot.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Darrell.
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
Open up!
You got the money?
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
Eh?
Soda.  You got any soda?
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
No! No police.
I'm just going to my car?
That's right on my way.
Maybe I don't want you to.
I like that about me, beautiful.
It's Grace.
May I carry your package, Grace?
You sure you can manage?
I got it.
What happened to your hand?
Accident.
You should be more careful.
You're welcome, Grace.
You're not from around here, are you?
Drove into Superior?  What for?
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
I didn't say it bothered me.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Thank you.
What do you do anyway?
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.
Lift me down.
Beautiful?
And what would that be?
Still playing?
You know what I want.
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.
No.
Did you ever?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I don't know how.
Walk away.
Nothing.
Don't feel like nothing.
Nothing I understand better than a mess.
You don't have any money put away, do you?
There is no us, remember?
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
No! You get it!
I'm not coming back.
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
But I thought --
What are you talking about?
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
<u>I don't know why</u>!
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
My mother died in this canyon.
But we all need that too. Hold him.
I busted my leg!
Can you make it back up?
'Cause I love you.
Harlin's.
Get in.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
Where to?
Out of here.
But, in particular?
I don't care, just get me there.
One way, or round trip?
One way.
30.55. Twenty more will get you back.
The ticket is 30.55.
What kind?
Beck's.
No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
Heineken?
I think I burned my gun hand!
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
Wrong number.
They look nice.
You haven't even looked at them once.
You didn't hear something?
Like you helped her, Jake?
Is Noel in?
Yes.
You've made a considerably wise decision.
How old is Jeb?
Four.
What about Jeb?
I have a lock on the door.
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
He's asleep.
Oh.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Not a specific day. What's this about?
Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
Oh.
Yes. Is this David?
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
out again?
Rust?
My turn. What's your favorite song?
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
We're supposed to be honest.
What about the game?
It's finished. I won.
I don't know Megan.
In college. A car accident.
Was it serious?
You assumed wrong.
We've already begun.
Is there a problem?
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
But not a knife?
I don't know what you're asking?
You're skill.
One last question.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
Yes he is.
Consider him packed. I didn't like his attitude... Struttin around with a cane and shit.
I want to sleep here tonight.
I think it's be better if I was alone.
I won't make any noise.
Just one--
I'll help you.
There's nothing to do.
I lied.
Two hundred and seventy.
There's no more left?
I see.
I'm not scared.
That's great.
Do you know why?
Know what?
Elijah was wrong.
Jeremy listen to what--
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
Is David Dunne there?
Okay.
Against a window.
In the passenger car?
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
Was your family traveling with you?
How did you get together?
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
Where is it?
On a bench, across the street.
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
But what they done, they...
I fined 'em instead.
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
You told them cowboys you had it.
We was... lyin'.
Thank God.
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
Building his porch!
'Course he's coming.
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
He give 'em names?
Oh. How long I been here?
Three days. Are you hungry?
Three days? I must be.
That big guy lookin' for me?
Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
Me? No. No, I guess not.
Yeah. See?
She back in Kansas?
Shit and fried eggs.
Well, I was always tasting the soup two hours after I et it.
Oh.
Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day?
Oh yeah.
Uh... a little, maybe.
Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it.
All week?
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
They really got all that money, them whores?
You could run off them two cowboys.
I could run off them whores.
Nope. They'll stay out on the Spade country where they got friends.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
Like I said, I...
What's your name?
Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
I'll see you... in hell, you three fingered asshole.
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
They got a sign on him in front of Greely's?
N-no, sir?
Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.
Well, how about it?
About what?
No.
He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
Easy, Kid, easy.  Now, you hear that, Ned? The Kid can see fifty yards fine, hear?
You don't recollect!
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
He got the boy's horse.
I got him.
Yeah.
You still think he's in there?
Yeah, he's in there.
You can shoot him.
Yup.
Yeah.
Just SHOOT!
Yeah.
First one I ever killed.
Yeah?
We all got it comin', Kid.
Lemmee see it.
Sure. Sure, Bill.
You better get on back, Miss.
I'd rather be blind and ragged than dead, I guess.
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
You ain't shot.
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
I could tell you who was last, mister.
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
Two weeks, I guess.
This Kid, what's he like?
We'll come across him tomorra, I guess.
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
You ain't like that no more.
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
No. I mean...  ...an' get yourself a woman? You know?
Sometimes... yeah.  I don't miss it all that much.
He hit you?
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
I didn't see nothin' planted.
You're marking us, Bill.
HEY, KID.
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
IS THAT YOU, KID?
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
HEY KID, IT'S ME, BILL MUNNY.
How far kin you see?
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
Huh? Uh... yeah.
I seen him.
He's dead, Bill.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
She was all covered with worms. Oh, Ned, I'm scared of dyin'...
Two.
Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
Two more hogs got the fever.
Best we move that pig.
Three? That ain't bad considerin'.
Tom?
Did I what?
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
No... I meant...
What?
K-k-kill somebody?
Who said that?
Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
Thought you was followin' me.
I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me.  We didn't talk about no other fella.
You gonna share your half with him?
See that scrub oak yonder?
Fuck you.
He's blind, for Chri...
I ain't blind, you asshole.
Yeah.
I don't like the question.
Plenty of times.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
I don't kill nobody without him. 
Maybe.
Well, suppose he does?
We'll bury him.
That ain't what I mean.
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
Hell, yeah.
Bear with me here...
There's more.
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
They'll never stop.
I love you.
They ruined me tonight.
Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?
Alright.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
Then who goes?
We all go. How about it, Keaton?
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
They fucking know everything.
The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
What do you care what he says?
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
I can run. I got no problem with that.
If I'm going in, I want a stake.
County. I was in for fraud.
I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
If you'll just let me -
Never heard of him.
You okay?
I'11 be alright.
Well, I'm sorry.
Forget it.  I'11 probably shit blood tonight.
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Maybe more.
No killing?
Who's Keyser Soze?
Russian, I think. I don't know.
Just do what I tell you.
What time is it?
This I had to see myself.
You know damn well, dead-man.
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
Mr. Soze will be most -
You're lying.
Am I? 92 92    INT. HALLWAY - FIFTIETH FLOOR
Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
You didn't know.
What'the fuck is that?
Two hours, tops.
I want to see him.
Someplace else, then.
Where?
Waste of time.
Nothing. Something I - forget it.
He was a corrupt cop, Verbal.
I just want to hear your story.
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
You know Ruby is in Attica?
He didn't have my lawyer.
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
Is he the one that killed Keaton?
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
Kobayashi.
Came from Redfoot.
Right.
If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
Give a guy a break, huh?
Why didn't you say anything?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Keaton was Keyser Soze
NO.
You think he's..?
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
Abrams...
I'm fine.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Nothing.
How good's your intelligence?
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
We thought it was just.
You thought it was just.
Yes.
Yes.  It would be.
And no one will know the truth.
What is the truth?
Mickey told me to come back to work.
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
It looks that way.
Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ...
What does it mean?
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth.
Say it.
I was her doctor.
...I was one of a group of...
When she...
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr.Marx, of course...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
We went to Code Blue...
`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Well, many reasons, actually...
Tell me one?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
And what did your team do...
Well, we...
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
Frank Galvin.  We've met before.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
Your Honor...!  Your Honor...
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
Neurology?
No.
Orthopedics?
I'm just an M.D.
Through, through his book.
What book is that?
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
...of Anesthesiology?
`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
How old are you?
I am seventy-four years old.
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
I'm on the staff of...
Objection.
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
You may step down.
You would not...?
No.
Just now...
Yes.
You've just said you signed it.
You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
Why is that?
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
I am on the staff of...
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
It's a common medical term.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
I...um...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
No, you did fine.
No.  No.  Thank you. You go home.
And you wrote that...
Yes.
Yes?  Galvin, right?
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
Why?
) I'm sorry ...?
Okay.  I'll meet you here.  Tuesday night ... I gotta go.  You going my way?
... that's perfectly all right.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it?
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
You know what happened.
Nothing happened.
Who are you protecting, then?
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
Then why don't you testify?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
Why is that?
I was held up.
Thank you for seeing me.
That's perfectly all right.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
I had a witness disappear on me.
Ready, your Honor.
Defense...?
Mr. Concannon...?
Exception!
Mr. Alito, please.
Let me talk to Mickey.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
From the magazine?
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
How come you're calling me from...?
This is Miss Costello...?
Yes.  Price...
Pardon?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
Still looking.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
The TV didn't work.
And what are you?  A cop?
I'm a lawyer.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Really.  How wonderful for you.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
You just got lucky.   D'you eat yet?  Come on.
Maybe I can do something right.
Is this a bad time.
Do you want me to go...?
I've got to work.
Yes.
Isn't there something you...
That's what I am.
Yes.
I...do you want me to leave?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Is there going to be a later...?
Not if you don't grow up...
If I don't 'grow up...'
Stop pressuring me...
No...no...
No.
I don't have a goddamned idea.
I have to talk to you.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
Where is he?
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
Don't touch anything.
...I'm going to need your help...
What?
You got a good memory, Franky.
I had a good teacher.  McLean versus Urban Transport...
Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
I'm going to get laid.
Oh shit, what's today?
Today is Tuesday.  What?
I can't talk now.
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I'm swell.
That's right.
Yeah.  I'm awake.
Rooney's protecting someone.  Who is she protecting?
What difference can that make...? All right...
The broad has disappeared...
The Hospital...?
We got to talk.
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
It's locked?
... I'm sure you do ...
... You saw her?
Yes.  Yes, I have.
She did?
I just saw her.
In New York?
What?
Hi.  How are you doing?
You live in the neighborhood?
Four.  You're great with these kids.
Mrs...
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes.
Yes...
Kathy Costello.  That's my maiden name.
What did she say?
Yes.
A single hour.
Yes.
Yeah.
That's for sure, Frank.
Yes.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
...of the procedures...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
What happened in those three minutes...?
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
Huh.  And why is that?
So far you're great.  You got a cigarette?
I'll give you another complication: he still is.
I married into it.
You don't have to do it for a living.
Almost a year.
No, I'm all right.
Someone dead.
It's not my line.
Yes.
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
What for? Who are you?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!
What about?
You.
Why?
You won't have to.
Your name. And --
Judy Barton.
Who you are --
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
-- and how you happen to be living here.
It's a place to live, that's all.
But you haven't lived here long.
About three years.
But before! Where did you live before!?!
I want to know who you are.
No, you don't owe me anything.
Then will you for me?
Dinner... and what else?
Just dinner.
Because I remind you of her?
Because I'd like to have dinner with you.
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
Mmm.
Okay.
Can I see you tomorrow?
Tomorrow night? Well --
Tomorrow morning.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
No? Then what?
That's not very complimentary, either.
I want to! Come on!
No, it's not right.
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
But why?
We'll take it! Will it fit?
Yes. Yes, I do.
Ernie's?
Well, after all, it's "our place."
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
That's what I had in mind.
Too late. I've got my face on.
All in good time.
How does it work?
Can't you see?
Oh, yeah. There.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
No, it's all right.
Madeleine died here.
Why?
No! Let me go!
We're going up the tower.
I'm going to. It's my second chance.
We'll find him.
Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
I loved you, Madeleine.
Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
You...  ...fell into the Bay.
No...
At...
When?
Oh... wandering about.
Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
You like it, too.
I... didn't know where you lived.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
Some people prefer it.
No... it's wrong.
...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
I enjoyed talking to you.
What?
Meet again, sometime.
We have.
Good-bye.
Shopping?
No.
Well... anywhere in particular?
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
The oldest living things?
Knowing I have to die...
Only silence. It's always like this.
And no birds sing.
No.
No, thank you.
Here with you.
Where?
The tall trees...
Yes...
When?
Long ago...
Where?
No!
What?!
Home?
...somewhere in the light.
No... it's in shadow.
A grave...
Where?
I know.
There's a name on the gravestone.
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
I'm so afraid...  ...you won't let it happen...
All the time.
Only this far.
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
And it's a all real.
Yes.
I love you too... too late... too late...
Too late... there's something I must do...
Let me go.
Where?
Please let me go.
Yes... you run this hotel.
Oh, yes!
Please answer my question.
Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.
How long has she had the room?
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
What car?
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
How do you know? Personal experience?
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
What do you mean?
Why?
I know. Everybody tells me.
Johnny, the doctors explained --
It's where you belong.
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
I'm having one now.
Oh!
That's following a train of thought.
Normal.
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Could be.
My... the acrophobia.
Okay.
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Pop Leibel.
Who?
Pop Leibel? Sure.
And she died...
For what?
Nothing to tell.
You haven't told me everything.
I've told you enough.
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
Out. I've got things to do.
Carlotta?
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Mmm, yeah, I guess...
Bye-bye!
Where?
Around.
Oh?
Did you need it?
Yeah.
Oh?
What I've been doing?
Wandering.
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
What is it, a still life?
No, not exactly. Want to see?
How?
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
Excellent.
I need a drink.
Don't touch her. Call 911.
That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!
What?
What's that?
What did you say?
I didn't hear you.
Well that's what I said.
You're an asshole.
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
Name one.
I don't have to...
Why was the floor wet?
I don't know why the floor was wet!
It's sacrilegious.
You're pathetic.
What did you say?
You're not a team player.
Don't point at me.
The hell you do.
They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
And you're a little fucking reject.
Eat my ass!
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
You go home!
You want to hear me out?
You don't know what you're doing.
What?
What are you doing?
What are you talking about?
What do you think you are doing?
I'm calling the ambulance.
You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options.
I'm calling the police.
Sure, why not.
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
So I didn't fucking do it!
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
What?
We can't do this.
That is absolutely not true.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
I am not flexible on this.
Alright. Let's do it.
What does that mean?
You got us into this mess.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
Don't talk to me about character.
I can't do this.
At the seven-eleven.
Who? What are you talking about?
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
Nobody's smoking anybody out.
I got children. I've got a life.
No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
They're driving me nuts!
They're singing.
They're screaming for Starbursts.
Later.
There is no candy!
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
No...we want padded chairs...okay?
Don't eyeball your kids.
If anything ever happens to me...
I know...
What happened? Oh my God...
It has to be done.
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
Where's the bathroom?
There's more.
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
So where's that leave us?
Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
Don't sweet lip me.
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
Where is she?
Who?
The groom?
Doing the bachelor party thing?
That's right.
She's still working?
That's right.
Great. Fine. Perfect.
Fish?
Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
Not tonight.
Here's his head.
I'm not talking to you?
What is her disposition?
Give me two more.
Well, I didn't mean it.
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
No.
She's dead. Call somebody!
Shut up.
Call 911.
Good God...Good God...
I'm talking about prayer.
Go ahead.
You always were a jealous man.
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
He is not cracking up.
Boyd...What have we done?
What did you ask me?
What?
I said, what have we done?
What?
Exactly! Exactly my point.
What are you going to do?
Take care of business.
What does that mean?
Isn't it a little late?
Fine? Fine what?
Whatever you say Kojak.
I'm serious.
It's my fucking opinion.
The hell you didn't!
The hell I did!
False.
Not true.
You have a King fantasy.
New king.
Then what do they have?
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
What? What's your point?
Take Mexico.
What?
You will not screw this up.
We're not goosed.
Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
Goosed!
Goosed!
Give me the Valium.
How about my Fatburger?
The rings?
Government cutbacks.
We missed the deadline.
I don't think so.
I'm not sure.
What do you mean, you think so?
Sent it.
Photographer?
Sent it.
Caterer?
Yes.
I think I forgot the tent.
You forgot the tent?
I think so.
Why?
Why what?
You can't play around with these tent people.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
What else have you forgot?
How could I know what else I forgot?
What?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
Are we going to do this again?
I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
How do you figure?
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
He's a moron.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
Charles Moore for instants.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
I just don't see him in the big picture.
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
He's weird.
He's quiet.
He's weird.
Why? What's his problem?
He's a great chef.
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
It's vile!
I've seen it on television.
Of course.
How much?
With all my heart.
Kiss me...?
Problems?
Okay.
Keith do not trivialize this.
I'm not. What's the problem?
Not padded ones.
So what do we do?
You go down there.
Go down where?
Honey I don't have the time...
I need your help.
I'll call them from the road.
Do you love me?
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
Do you love me?
Of course.
Have a nice bachelor party.
Hi.
Not yet.
Well you should.
Just a bit of organizing.
Nesting?
I'm mad at you.
Go have fun. Not too much.
I'll see you tomorrow...
Hey. It's me.
Where are you?
What about the chairs?
Okay.
What okay?
What!
The chairs.
No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
"At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."
Well, can you come back inside?
Yeah. Sure.
Now?
Are they fighting?
No baby. We'll all be right in.
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
Can we just talk this out?
I know.
Okay. Okay.
Yes.
What?
Do you love me?
What kind of stupid question is that?
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
The prostitute.
You fucked a prostitute?
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
You killed a prostitute.
Micheal, by accident.
Call the police.
It's too late.
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
What money?
What does that mean?
So what do we do?
Move the bodies.
Move the bodies?
Just kills me...
I love you dad.
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
What does that mean?
It means she's insecure.
About what?
He's your brother.
So?
Come on.
I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
At the newsstand on 3rd.
Buzzing?
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
Have another drink.
How do you know she's dead.
What?
I have no idea.
Greenpeace.
Greenpeace?
Downstairs in the closet.
All week long.
That's what I'm thinking.
The post-Vegas Man.
A mutant species.
Okay boys, smile!
So where to on the honeymoon?
Drum banging real times.
It was an accident!
That's right.
I KILLED MY BROTHER!
No, the children sleep with me.
Give them to Refugio.
You'd like me to kill them?
It's a present from my parents.
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
What's that?
What about them?
They're playing games behind the couch ...
You'll think you're still at the convent.
No.
Who is she?
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
You see, even the voice.
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
Don't you ever see him?
Never.
Don't worry. He won't be forgotten.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
Don't go!
Go away! Leave me alone.
I've listened to you long enough. Let me out.
Yes, sir. Good night.
Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her.
Yes, sir.
It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
She won't even know.
Yes.
I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
Fifteen yards.
That's fifteen by seven?
That's it.
Good.
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
That's good land.
Thank you; but it's missing something.
He was asking for it.
But why? Why?
Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
Nothing.
It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
What are you going to do?
That your cousin is more to your taste.
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
If you free me, you'll be a rich man ...
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
Are you Jorge?
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
I'm not interested. Do what you think's best.
I know that you used to work with an architect.
I'm not like you, you have your wife.
They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you.
Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
She's left.
Is she coming back?
No.
Why?
Canelo!
They told me it isn't at the hospital.
Things seem to be getting better.
Stop this!
He's lying through his ass!
You cannot leave ...
Why not?
There's been an accident.
Where?
Come with me.
I'm afraid.
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
A black bull came.
A black bull!
Very, very?
Yes -- very, very big!
He couldn't get through the door, then?
You little liar! Get out of here!
They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
This louse is looking for trouble.
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
A suicide is horrible. I know. But you should have told me.
You are forgiven. Goodbye.
Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
Ah! Pleased to meet you.
I have a headache.
That will soon pass. It's nothing.
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
Hello.
Today, a good girl.
Yes, yes, I saw you!
From the terrace.
You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.
Catch him and your record's clean.
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
Why would they be going there?
I don't know.
I wish we could hear them.
He was a computer program for crissake.
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
Do me a favor  keep sending them.
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
It's too early in the morning for me to be cordial. You got any coffee?
If you can catch him.
What she's going to do is get in my way.
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
Where's my gun?
If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
I don't set policy.  You have the key?
Not from in here.
He hears...everything.
As a matter of fact, I do.
Do I get to see it or not?
Bastard...  Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
You're...such a wimp.
It's nanotechnology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
It feels so.. .real.
Separate the character module from the neural net...
What I need is a nymphomaniac.
How should I know?
Show me his physical sensory level.
Turn it down!
Think hard -- it'll come to you...
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
It was me, what?
All my work is my finest.
Of course you are.
Glad to...
Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever...
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
What you need is a collar.
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?
I'm still working on it.
He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
And I'm going to make sure of it.  Give me your wrist.
How did you get your hand out?
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
What does that mean?
Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?
Stop me.
You know I am.
This isn't a game, Parker!
Tell him.
I'm doing the best I can!
Both.
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
That, or living through him...
Thanks.
You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
That's why I'm asking.
...I think so...You?
Lindenmeyer?
My guess is dead.
Sid?
I don't know.
I couldn't tell you.
Then shoot him already.
Duck!
You won't want to watch. Turn around.
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
Do they have to look so...robotic?
What are you saying...
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
It's the White House.
<u>Hello</u>.  What?
For Schumann.
No, this is great.
Okay.  Okay.  The <u>Suitcase</u> Bomb...
King, we've got to be on the streets in...
What can it hurt is they offend me.
I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?
Gonna be fine.  Gonna be fine, people?  Are we getting there...?
...can we have a white one...?
Can we have a white one, please...
All we have to do now is sell it to the President.
...like the <u>sound</u> of it, eh...
...and...
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
Come on.
...where?
Come on.
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
...the Harvester... 
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
And <u>what</u> is bigger than a triumphal Homecoming...?
John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....
Who's got the story? 
Don't you want to know if it's true?
All I need is the one day.
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
And you?
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
....we landing?
Tell me again.
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
...the... 
The American "people"?
Yes
Who's gonna tell'em.
...but...
...that's the general idea.
Why?
<u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
Well, I'm <u>working</u> on it....
Why?
Precisely.
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The Hostages...?
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?
We'll be back tonight.
Waal, that's where you <u>want</u> em...

Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...
An <u>Albanian</u>, a young Albanian Girl.
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
<u>I</u> dunno.... Ambassador to <u>Togo</u>, somethin', <u>I</u> dunno... he...
Maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
Yeah...what was I talking about...?
You're tired, Ronnie.
...Stanley Moss...
...brazen-it-through...
What are we gonna <u>do</u> about it...?
The War is Over.
Gloria -- sell the House.  
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"... 
Fine. 
Never quit a winner.
Well, what do you want to do about it?  What do you...
Could we have you in here, please...7
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
THE GROUP WATCHING TELEVISION.
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
Out in Oklahoma.
Could if we had to.  Rather not.  Rough weather.
Heavy weather East of here.
Whaddaya think?
N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?
My name is Ronald Brean.
Who're you working for?
Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
I have a question for you.
Ask it.
Why do people go to war?
Why do people go to war?
Why do they go to War?
To preserve their Way of Life.
Would you go to War to do that? 
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
...you the Press Office?
...Yes.
Well, that's what we're <u>doing</u> here...
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
When's he coming back...?
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
We have some mutual friends in Washington.
...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>.
Yeah, hut you can't hold the dam.  How the hell, n'nu'n', I don't get what you want <u>me</u> to ...
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
Remember the Maine...

N'it's a crying shame.  But you <u>staged</u> the Oscars...
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
Because.
I'm sure they do.
What do we have that they want?
Why would they want that?
Act Two:  and then, Act Two...
We don't need an Act Two.
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
It's a teaser, absolutely right,
Ten Days.  There going to be any Back End in this thing?
"Back End" ... count on it.
President's speech.
...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>...
It's not too <u>clean</u>...
In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
Where is he now?
Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...
...we get our hands on him?
They got him standing by.
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Oh, you're gonna love this:
Haven't had so much fun since Live TV.
Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
Just for the Symmetry of the thing...?
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
All the greater accomplishment.
Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
...the Albanian Campaign.  This... this is history...
We <u>were</u> the Albanian campaign, John -- <u>We Were There</u>.
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
...givem what they want...But...
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
What <u>kind</u> of stuff?  Hello...?
Is he dead?
Uh huh...why?
We're going home.  We're going home together...
Why not?
Some'b'y'll have you killed.
What he went through in <u>Albania</u>...
He's doped to the <u>Gills</u> ...
No, I'm fine... I got it together....
You got a dime....?
They'll be here in ten minutes.
Naw, naw, we own the airways... 
Show Must Go On.
A proud tradition.
I'm looking for a phone...
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that.
Leave it flat, will you, Ben?
It's too clean.
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
What guards Us Against Canada...?
He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
Tell'em to fly the Inaugural Speech past me.
Leopard Skin...
It's a <u>beret</u>...
British Regiments drape their drums in Leopard Skins.
Thank God this is America.
...one minute:  Demille needs an elephant for a reshoot.
No, he's back in Nashville.
No problem.  Here's the...
...the pet wrangler suggested it..he's also got a...
You like it?
Yes.
Fine.  Good.
I believe in you....
Albania, Albania, Albania, James bond Villains.
John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi...
Jim Belushi...?
Surest thing you know.
Yeah, good good good good good.  And They're <u>So</u> <u>Secret</u>...
And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...
The hats.
A beret.
Why a beret?
...their Leopard Skin Berets....
Hey, <u>you're</u> getting the big bucks....  I think we're up-and-running...
...you're gonna Punch in a Kitten Later.
Why...?
...of kittens...
...for the beans, yes...
Show some compassion.
Is today Laundry Day...?
How 'bout a Cold Drink...?
Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?
Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
Great Charlie, any better it'd be a sin.
Yeah, but he didn't see me.
Anacott Steel. Buy it.
Then get out and close it behind you.
Thanks, buddy, buddy, I'm back. Say, Buddy, those optorectomies do work wonders.
Start unloading.
Now! Tell everyone to dump!
Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
About what?
The FAA announcement.
Alright. Why so pissed?
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
You speak for me, son.
Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
What if they call him?
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
So you're hot on this stock?
What was that?
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
...and if I did, what's in it for moi?
All right, Bud... let's do it.
Jackson, Steinem...
Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
...finish out the game, Bud, push yourself...
What? How do you know about my father?
Stick around... Larry, one of my "gang" -- Bud Fox.
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
Are you with me Buddy?
Gordon.
Oh yes, I remember you.
...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
Upper West Side.
You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
Only if I want something bad enough.
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
I don't.
That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.
Why?
Any better and I'd be guilty.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
...how do you know? You wish...
Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought.
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
You told him about us?
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
He still likes you
Yeah 
Just give it a break China ok? CHINA Jeez.  Can't even take a joke
It's eleven forty-five let's go
About what?  About us.
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Suffer?  We're living in America.
Hi
It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
Are you sure you wouldn't like a closer look?
Thank you Jenkins
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
And uh, your nicotine sir
Allow me sir
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Have a nice day  sir
Good evening sir.
No Jonathan.
You don't happen to have the address do ya?
Uh, wrong picture Tony.
Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
They seemed, closing by much 
Tony and China?
Vell.  Goodnight.
What?  Tony and China, together?
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
Go away.
Right.
Right behind you.
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Well divide 18 into three
Six six and six
Maybe before the event, never after.
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
I'll think about it.  Now run along darling.
Never fear, Tony is here.  Ladies first.
Hey.
It's only two hours away.
I know that.
I'll come back all the time.
I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
No, he wouldn't.
I know he does.
So much.
I started seeing things.
A ghost?
No.  But once I heard...
What?
Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
Then why did you?
Because he was worried about me.
No.
You're joking.
Mm-hmm.
Pretty.  She's a blond.
You think that'll help?
Nope.
Well, that's what we're here for.
Your friend saw them.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
You think you influenced her?
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
No.
What do you think?  Guess.
There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
Toward the end.  You remember?
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
The wives.
Um...
She isn't here.
When...when will she be back?
I don't know.
Oh-kay...
I have to go.
I didn't kill my wife.
Um...yes.
I've seen you.  From the window.
Is everything alright?
I'm not...
I can't, no, no, I can't...
I've never even met you.
You do?
Very much.
Thank you.
You're going to think I'm crazy or something.
What?
No.  No, I don't.
Yeah.
You know where she is?
No, I don't.
Please leave me alone.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
I don't know.
I should be going anyway.
Of course.
Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
This is...
We know each other.
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
I didn't sleep with him.
...just so she could cut them off.
He was so pissed.
I came in from my room...
We were suite mates.
Good.  I'm good.
You are?
Well good.  So you're human.
Jody--
She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
It's niiice.
What?
Seance.
Jody, no...
Telling you...
...no...no...no...
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
Please.  That's all I need.
What?
I don't...
The planchette?
This.
Shhh.
M-E...
It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.
Jody, wait.
I think so
Jody, she's alive.
What?
Did I?
Please.
I was down in Adamant...
Adamant?
No.
I don't know.
If she was dangerous before--
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
I know.
I can't believe this is happening.
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
Jody he was lying.
Three weeks.
We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
Norman Spencer.
Yep.
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
Fine.
I am, really.
You know what I mean.
I know.
Nope.
Wanna fool around?
Shhh.
Tomorrow.
Of him I think.
Did she say that?
I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
Claire...
It's what I've been working for.
Hurry...
No, no.  It's fine.
In the house.  I was scared.
Did you call the police?
I don't know.  Just...whispering.
I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
You are so brilliant.
Yep.
You know what that does to me.
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
Oh, no...
I'm so sorry.
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
What?  No.  No.
You didn't?
Did you call about the Feurs?
What's going on, Claire?
Shhhh.
What?
No.  Look!  In the window.
A flare?
What am I looking at?
I didn't do that.
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
...Don't get all...
...like it never even happened...
Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
Well, that's a relief.
Harvey says he's amazing.
Norman...
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
We had a seance.
Who did?
What are you...?  No.
I will NOT.
Then where is she?
Yep.
Call ya later.
We walked all night...
You told me that I was...
I...
But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
What's wrong with me?
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
Yes.  The ghost.
...I'm positive this time...
...Please stop...
STOP IT!
Wouldn't go that far.
What's the matter?
It's too rough.
Since when?
Your wife...
STOP IT!
What?
Claire--
So you fucked a student?!
That's not what I'm sayi--
To Caitlin!!
You should have tried harder.
Claire...
Get out of my way.
We don't know that for sure.
Of course she did, Norman.  What else could it be?
What?
How can you be sure?
Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
What?
Do you know it?
Don't think so.
Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
Nothing.
I'm cooking you dinner.
You don't have to do that.
I know.
Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
Shhhh.
Mauduh...
:Well, they are.
But you've not told Michael.
But why would they do that...?
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
Gifford - that box glued to your hands...?
Nothing worse than a common tool.
It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
I wish to speak to Ellie Mayfair.
When did she die...?
Who is this...?
I under5tand.  All the same
Who the hel1 -
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
In the coffin, my dear.  where else...?
There are things I have to know!
Better than most, I suppose.
She didn't feel them
It wes a dream...!
The door, Michael.  find the key...
Help us.  Do what you can.
Michael...  Help us...  The door!
Now, lasher - it is our time.
Anybody got a BP yet...?
uh - then he - be just -
He just went out like & light-
Like this...?
Always loved you..
Explain this to me --- violated...?
It is from love.
To love, you must be able to feel.
If that were true, I would not be here.
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
It's too soon to know.
But I could understand. I want to understand!
Do not tell me that!
I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!
Then help me--- for his sake...
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
I do not understand...
There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
Rowan...
Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
Yessss...
Always loved you. Rowan.  Always...
My jury's still out on that,
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
The one time I want it to work...
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
HARDER!
Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
Yessssss...
Really...?  Your family there...?
He fools around with his patients too.
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
Captain's orders.
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...
Mad. for each other.
Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
Rowan...?
Goodbye, Michael.   I love you.
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
Hello..
If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
I don't think of us that way - ever.
No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
A little wine...?
Dropped it.
Mm-hmmm...
Did you see the old man on the ---
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
Talking to me dear...?
Lock the door.  Lock it
A bit much.    Lucas.
Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.
What were you talking about...?
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
It's alright...it's airight.  He's gone, Michael...  Gone.
You can't just -
Go away, GODDAMNIT!
That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?
If you like that type.
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
Yes.   Partly.  It's - it's -  Stu - do you believe in ---
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
You really love this guy...?
He's got great hands.
I like him.  He can stay.
Is that a crack about our singing...?
Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
The one on the left - definitely...
Don't give me shit - what do you want?
As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
I'm sorry - I didn't think
Yes it is...
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
And it can't be forged?
No - not all the time - I mean
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
Yes - I have had it for years.
I really don't know what to say
The touch?
I'm sorry?
Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
I'm a dentist
And how many people have you killed?
I don't know
You don't know?
No she didn't...
What did you do with her?
Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
I have something I have to show you...
Why should I?
Why not? Please - it would help me
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
Nothing could be better...
Open it...
Out - I may be some time
LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think
Yes - I suppose so...
He doesn't need to...
What was I supposed to do?
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
It's what you would do to me
No - I'll have you after
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
He saved my life you know - has he told you...
What's this all about?
So have you seen hubby recently ELLEN?
No - a dentist
No worries
Oh...
Yes...?
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
Yes - one please.
That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again.
I defy any and all limits.
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
Well, Dad said...
Maybe he got promoted.
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
Not ever. Never.
Yeah, whatever.
I better go, Dad.
What is it now?
Check it out!
Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.
Take a whiff of heaven.
I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
You'll never believe who's in there.
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
This is a fun place...but we don't usually come here until after the orgies.
Oh, god.  Look. Look.
We reinvented ourselves.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
Jealousy is so unattractive.
He kicked major ass and you know it.
You go first.
Ladies first.  I insist.
Well. The prom's coming up.
Yeah?
And I was wondering.
Yeah?
SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
But that smile.
Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible.
You know...take the pictures?
That was code for "I like you."
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
Things change. Now I'm taking off my clothes...all by myself.
I mean, what do you think?
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
We own a small family grocery store.
Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
We love our lives just the way they are.
We miss our family.
Of course we are.
Well, why should I?
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
It's okay. You need me?
Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.
I will not have my boys arguing.
They're in the ignition, silly.
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
Some of them have to be automatics.
The one with the horses.
That's me.
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
Hi ho, Silver.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
And who IS Ted Nelson?
Hmmm?
What do you want me to do?
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
Hang in there, I'll think of something.
I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary.
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
Very funny.
You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
You want it in writing?
Just a formality.
I meant biologically.
That's a crappy thing to say.
Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
--Do it. I triple-dog-dare you.
In what sense?
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
Me?
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
Interesting.
You never know around here.
Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
Why can't you be nice to me?
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
To the best hiding place in the world.
He didn't. He had it built.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
I see.
I doubt it.
I mean my father.
It's incredibly simple.
And then what?
I know.
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
Well? Where the hell are you?
He's on the move?
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
What about you?
Tell me more.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
Not a chance.
Come on.
But absolutely true.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
Let your fingers do the walking.
I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town!
What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
Only the best for my mother.
You promise you'll finish school?
I'll make you very proud.
But how would we pay our bills?
Forget the store. Think big.
Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
You called the cops on us?
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
I have only one concern...
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
As much as possible.
You're sure?
I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
Tipping?
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
I was like a different person tonight.
You were the new and improved you.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
He was in a league of his own.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.
My job. Back off, Benedict.
Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.
People pay good money for that?
I'm just a messenger.
Your fathered owned the entire "Heaven" empire.  You own it now. Any questions?
I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
Kelly Van Ryan...
I... You know... I...
Thanks.
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.
I'm fine.  Nice TV.
Suzie Toller is missing.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
You could tell me where you were last night.
Back to the land of grownups.
It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
Lombardo's settlement?
I net a guy in a bar.
You could say that.
Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
Just check out the car.
Where's the body?
We don't know that, Ray...
Ray, you heard him...
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.
Where's Lombardo?
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
Yeah, maybe, a little.
He dropped Jimmy off first?
Yeah.
Yes.
I guess.
No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
What was that?
Yeah... okay... he did
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
I said he did.
Yeah.  But I got my bike.
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
You are.
Nothing.
I think we just need to get wasted.
I'm not on your property!
Hi, Mon.
Sam!  Hi!
Whichever one I want.
You notice my new jumper?
I would hardly say you look like trash.
No thanks to you.
I miss Dad.
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
No you don't.
Yes.  God, Mom...
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
Where, the mall?
A friend of mine bought a boat.
I won't.
In back of the garage.
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
So you got my mom's money.
We have to stick with the plan.
Yes.
There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
Hello.
God, I've been calling you.
I don't know.  I want to see you...
Say you love me.
I love you.  Now give me the line.
No little girl can ever make me come.
You think that's wise?
Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
You can't...
I did.  At Blue Balls.
Will they?
It doesn't look like it.
Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
The one you bought at school.
And she wanted to talk.
Yes.
That's right.
Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
Put Kelly on too.
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.
Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
Can't.  Got a passenger.
Shit. Here we go again.
Didn't you see her this morning?
Jim West.
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Put them all together and what do we have?
I'll work on it.
Aha?
My disguise.  And here...
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
Yes.  Now, observe....
Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
All what?
All that jumping and kicking.
It's a repeating steam cannon!
Hey, I tried the board.
"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
Uh... how long ago was this?
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
It's better than nothing.
It is?
Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.
It's not a guy...
It's a town!
Relax.  We're almost there.
I adjusted it.
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
My pleasure.
I know!  I know!
Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
Where have you been?
Well, sure.  Didn't you get your orders?
I'm sure we will.
But it only has six legs.
Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
We'll see.
Wonderful!  Our new friend from the wild west.  Please...
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
Would that include me?
Oh, I would hope not.
I've had some practice.
You bring the best out in a man.
I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
Yes sir.
This is Colonel Richards.
Nice to finally meet you, sir.
And now the job's yours.
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
I deal with some tough customers.
How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?
Philistine.
The first.
Yes!
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
We'll explain on the way.
He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
It's a smelting retort.
It is?
They're coming.
When are they coming?
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
In an hour they're gone!
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
You managed alright.
Is this what's left of your army?
They're not after me.  They want the baby.
Just get me some horses.
Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
Let's go.
Yes...?
You are very important, Willow.
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
Not today, Willow.
My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow...
No.  I mean yes.
Let me see it.
Why not?
Why not?
You're not a woman.
Too bad you're not more like your father.
I'm not going to let this baby die.
Say what?
I don't believe you.
Madmartigan.
He turned that monster into stone!
I will!  But I need help!
Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
As above, so below.
Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
Good.  How long will it take?
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
Are you okay?
Farmer.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
Are you a warrior?
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
You hear trouble.
What is it?
I hate this.
I will.
Fresh goat's milk.
Absolutely!
Time to leave.
Because she's sick.
I thought you had her!
I did?
I won't.
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
Who?
Well what did she say?
You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
Want me to carry Elora?
Ahhh!
Absolutely not.
I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
Kill him!
That's all I ever wanted!
Burn it to a fine ash.
The limitless power of...
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
Shhhhh!
Now use it.
No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
There's nobody here.
She's too powerful, Raziel
Surrender!!
Courage, Willow.
He never misses.
Me neither!
Ouch!  Let go of me!
Who is he?
I don't know much about him.
You're the guardian, aren't you?
No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
How are we going to get out there?
Milking?
Cows. You know, cows?
I've seen pictures.
Good, you start tomorrow.
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Not used to hard work. That's what makes an appetite.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
They're Amish.
John, I don't understand any of this.
Just do it!
Try the house.
It's been a while.
Pretty much.
Yes, sir.
Pick up the hat.
No... I saw the man who killed him.
Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
You don't say.
...I want to say a thing.
What's that, Sam?
I'll be all right. You just do as I say.
I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
Sure have, Sam.
Oh, he's good.
Amish.
Yeah.
What have you got?
You know who?
Maybe.
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Just us.
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
Just us.
How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
Move! Or you die right here!
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
I would not be too sure.
What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
You couldn't wait until morning?
But why?
Only the elders.
How long?
Two days.
You tell him. When you're able.
Buttons are Hochmut.
Hochmut?
But Stoltzfus said...
I know what he said.
We had some lemonade and he left.
A real fireball.
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea.
Not long... A few days.
I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
Aren't you? After today?
Here. Whenever you want them.
I didn't even know about it.
Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like?
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
That's more like it.  Where are you at, anyway?
Say again?
Make that 1790.
Wrong.
You'd lie to protect him.
Probably.
I admit I don't know where he is.
You're the first one he'll contact.
He's got my number.
Not yet.
But... if you had to guess?
Yes, thank you very much.
John said you're Amish.
Yes.
Oh.
You didn't have to...
His name is John Book.
No...
Looks dead...
You are acting like one!
I will be the judge of that.
I have to help him!
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
I don't think she knows.
Tight. But I'm working on him.
Lean on him.
All right, where is he?
You might have killed him!
Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll watch these two.
My son is out there!
Nobody's going to hurt your son...
No... No. It is just the English way.
I wish dawdie was with us.
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --
Oh -- all right.
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
Yes, darling.
If she...
If she?
Is morally, ethic'ly
You'll be hist...
I don't believe you!
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Goodbye, folks!
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
Oh, please give me back my dog!
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
Catch him, you fool!
Toto, too.
Oh, now?
Whenever you wish.
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
No, they won't - honestly.
Oh --
Oh -- yes.
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
Her -- her name is Emily.
Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
Oh, no -- no!
Oh, you....
Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right....
No --
Did you say something?
Oil can....
My mouth -- my mouth!
...Oh, did that hurt?
Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
All hollow.  Oh --
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh! Oh!
Oh --
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
I knew you would!
You've had plenty of time already!
Yes...!
Look -- it ticks!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my! 
Oh.
The nerve.
Yes.
Hah!
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Supposin' you met an elephant?
I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
I'd sooner wait outside.
But why?  Why?
Because I'm still scared!
Oh, come on.
Ohh!
Huh?  What'd he say?
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
Did they hurtcha?
Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!
Ohhh!
Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
I think I'll miss you most of all.
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
It's pleasant down that way, too.
Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.
Ohhhh --
Ohh!
Oh -- does it hurt you?
My, it's good to be....
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
Did I scare you?
Um-hmm.
Where's Kansas?
Um-hmm.
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
To Oz?
To Oz!
Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
Yes.  Oh -- look --
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
Here -- here --
The other side....
Yes --- there.
And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
Did you just hear what I just heard?
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
Ah --
Dorothy next!
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
I don't know.
Somebody pulled my tail.
Oh, you did it yourself!
I -- Oh --
Here --   Come on.
What was that?
Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
Fine.  He's got a plan
And you're going to lead us.
Yeah. Me?
Yes, you.
Now...
This way!  Come on!
Yeah!
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
Why don't you try counting sheep?
That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.
Imposserous!
It's a whatzis?
Whozat?
Whozat?
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.
I hope your tail holds out. Oh --
Yeah.
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
No, her dog!
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
Ohhhhhh!
No, sir!
We do.
To Oz?
To Oz!
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Dorothy!
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Yes.
Here, Tin Man -- help me.
Ho -- ho --ho
Oh - look out.
You know something?
It's a whozis?
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
Oh, dear, dear.
We'll get you together!
But how can we find her? We don't even know where she is. Look! There's....
Oh --
Come on, fellows!
Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
Oh, no!
You put up a great fight, Lion.
Go on!
Yes.
Well, I --
Yes -- ....
Help!
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
Then its no longer a bomb?
Elektra King.
Makes her look even more innocent.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
I was hoping you could tell me.
Elektra would control it all.
We go down to the torpedo bay.
Hes going to insert the plutonium.
Like riding a bike.
Just wanted to put him on edge...
Count to twenty.  Ill be there.
So isnt it time you unwrapped your present?
James.  It wouldnt really be...
Perhaps after this ... test?
...yes?...
Quite the opposite, in fact.
Its barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
I was the one who brought that money in...
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
Renard.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Is maybe...the inside woman.
Who did you get it from?
Your last chance. Give me the name.
Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
Havent you heard the news?  So is she.
Yes.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
A word? Im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover.
Im sorry.
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
You dont take no for an answer, do you?
Were alright.
Youre not going to.
I know.
I think youre one of the bravest people Ive ever met.
I have to go.
Then take me with you.
No. Youll be safe here.
I have to go to work.
Two. Shaken not stirred.
You had your chance, James. Now Im looking for a bigger thrill.
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
I dont know what youre talking about!
Soon shell be everywhere.
Five more turns and your neck will break.
It is my oil!  Mine and my familys!
Elektra, its not too late.  Eight million people neednt die.
Oh James.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
You, of course. I need some information.
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
Shes no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic relationship.
I thought you were the one in her business.
A special job.  A...a...a submarine.
No!  Get me out!
How appropriate.
Bond!
Could...could you come?
Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
Is it?
How would you know?
What do you think?
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
Where it can do the most damage.
Still no contact yet.
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
I would like to use the bathroom --
No idea who's behind this?
Don't call me that.
Who is she?  Do you know her?
Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
We don't know that.
Hello, Adrian.
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
Not yet, there's plenty of time.
Mm hmm.
I could stay and go.
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
Cured, yes.
Veidts complex.
Jon -- for Gods sake, what do you see?
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.
I've seen them!  I've seen them in there. 
Im not.
What if youre wrong??
Damn straight!  We were heroes.
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
What are you up to?
Don't look.  Turn around.
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
The costumes.  Am I right?
I think he's going to the john.
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
Where did he go?
Those cars.  What year is this??
Everything's changed --
We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
What do you mean, frame-up?
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
SHUT UP, Rorschach.
We should get back --  What?
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?
Janey, will you marry me?
-- What?
No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
Isn't it true that you --
I don't know their real names.
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
I don't know their real names!
What does this mean?  What does it --
Am I free to go?
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
Laurie!  Good to see you.
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
Please.
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
I'm sorry about Blake.
ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
Ever see one of these before?
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
What is this place?
Looks like a diner.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
Just remember, I'll be watching.
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out.
I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
But programmable. And expendable.
I've seen enough. Turn it off.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
What weapons do you have?
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
He gets to be the hero.
You do everything Yorgi says?
Go to hell.
Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
I'm from L.A.
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
We'll have to go after them.
Aren't you afraid?
He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool.
Go to the water, it's that way!
Let me.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
You can't talk to it?
A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
Nice place to start, don't you think?
Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything you say, sir.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
What's the deal?
Been to any good diners lately?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
He's a pretty good actor, though.
It's like you said, every man for himself.
Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
This pizda? Never seen him before.
It'll work faster if I have an account number.
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
What's "Anarchy 99"?
That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
We all do.
What are you talking about?
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
I'll tell you one thing though.
What's that?
Uh-huh.
I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
I wanted to talk to you.
I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?
Sure you are, sport.
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
I won't light the cigars - how about that?
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
By reading my thoughts?
If necessary.
What if they're naughty?
He's busy right now.
What do you say?
Not interested.
Suit yourself.
He takes his work seriously.
He takes himself seriously.
I've seen a lot of rings.
Senator?
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
Let's just say, God works too slowly.
What do you want?
Come with me and I'll let her live.
To find Rogue.
How?
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
He helped you?
I'll go.
If she held on any longer she could have.
And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
How?
A piece.  Only a piece.
Is it enough?
ALIVE.
And I'll never understand terrorists.
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
And who might you be?
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
No!
What was your grandfather's name?
Victor Frankenstein.
From your office, sir.
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir?
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'
Yes, sir.
What?
Baack!
MMMmmmm.
Is it that music?
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
MMmmm.
Love me oodles and oodles?
MMmmm.
Hello...?
Surprised?
Well... yes.
Miss me?
I...
Of course.
You have your tickets?
Yes.
And your passport?
Yes, don't worry.
Promise??
I promise.
Oh, darling -- so will I.
Very....very!
I hope you like large weddings.
Whatever makes you happy.
Does that mean you love me?
You bet your boots it does.
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, darling!
Darling!
Surprised!
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
Why does he call you 'master'?
No, of course not.  I just meant...
All right then!
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
Is it worth taking a chance?
I suppose you're right.
That's my good boy.
Yes!... the laboratory.
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
May I have it, please?
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
I don't know what you mean, sir.
Will there be anything else?
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight.
Fron kon steen!
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.
But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
Do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir?
A week.  Ten days at most.
What?
I didn't do that.
One week at the most!?
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
I beg your pardon?
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Very good!  Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction... why don't we proceed?
Yes?
Vermicelli.
Nineteen, sir.
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
Fron kon steen!
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
And do you also say Fro dereck?
No, Fred ereck.
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
I see.
You must be Igor.
But they told me it was Ee gor.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
Yes, just the two.
I beg your pardon?
There wolf!  There castle!
Why are you talking like that?
I thought you wanted to.
No.
The wockers with the knockers.
Wockers with the knockers???
Home.
I wonder what's got into them?
Fro-derick!
What are you doing here?
Just putting up some tea.
Did you hear that strange music?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
Must be the music room.
Could be worse!
How?
Could be raining!
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
I want that brain.
Was he any good?
That's not bad.
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
If you like -- just hurry!
Thank you, Master.
This guy means business.
More, do you hear me?
What?
Throw the third switch!
Wait till he sees the bill.
Well, I don't like to see you mope.
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
It wasn't me.
I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
Give -- me -- your -- hand!
You can say that again.
Yes.
... I'm glad that's...
No, no!  That whole thing!
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Act casual!
What did you find out?
How do you know it was a 'she'?
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
That's what we're paid for.
Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
Is everything ready?
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
How's everything?
MMMmmmmmmmm.
MMmmm!  MMmmm!
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.
How nice.
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
I'm not sure I...get your drift.
Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
Well... I'll just finish unpacking.
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
I don't know.  It just woke me up.
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
What a filthy mess.
Well, this explains the music.
But who was playing it?
Perhaps we'd better leave.
Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
Yes!
I know.
Raise the platform, hurry!
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
I thought it was wonderful.
I think you've done it, master.
Alive!  Look at it.  I have defeated death!
What do you think we should do?
I think I'll...carry him.
Yes -- quickly, dear!
Are you serious??
Give him the sedative!
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
I think so.
Good night!
Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
Of course not.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
But, after all, you have yours.
And I have mine.
Why don't we talk inside?
Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.
It wouldn't be fair to her.
Yes, I know.
MMMMmmmmm!
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
His schwanzstucker.
Whew!  A nineteen-inch drill.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
Three minutes to go!
Yes.
Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
Do Something!  Stall them!
Food!
Do you have a reservation?
Food!!
Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.
ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
